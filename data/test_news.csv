" Top Trump Surrogate BRUTALLY Stabs Him In The Back: â€˜Heâ€™s Patheticâ€™ (VIDEO) It s looking as though Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is losing support even from within his own ranks. You know things are getting bad when even your top surrogates start turning against you, which is exactly what just happened on Fox News when Newt Gingrich called Trump  pathetic. Gingrich knows that Trump needs to keep his focus on Hillary Clinton if he even remotely wants to have a chance at defeating her. However, Trump has hurt feelings because many Republicans don t support his sexual assault against women have turned against him, including House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI). So, that has made Trump lash out as his own party.Gingrich said on Fox News: Look, first of all, let me just say about Trump, who I admire and I ve tried to help as much as I can. There s a big Trump and a little Trump. The little Trump is frankly pathetic. I mean, he s mad over not getting a phone call? Trump s referring to the fact that Paul Ryan didn t call to congratulate him after the debate. Probably because he didn t win despite what Trump s ego tells him.Gingrich also added: Donald Trump has one opponent. Her name is Hillary Clinton. Her name is not Paul Ryan. It s not anybody else. Trump doesn t seem to realize that the person he should be mad at is himself because he truly is his own worst enemy. This will ultimately lead to his defeat and he will have no one to blame but himself.Watch here via Politico:Featured Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images",Fake
"U.S. conservative leader optimistic of common ground on healthcare WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives could achieve common ground on a deal to win support for healthcare legislation on Thursday, after President Donald Trump intervened in negotiations, a conservative leader said on Wednesday. â€œWeâ€™re not there yet, but weâ€™re very optimistic that if we work around the clock between now and Noon tomorrow, that weâ€™re going to be able to hopefully find some common ground,â€ Representative Mark Meadows, chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, told reporters. Meadowsâ€™ group has opposed House Republican healthcare legislation up to now and threatened earlier in the day to block its passage in a Thursday vote.  ",Real
"Trump proposes U.S. tax overhaul, stirs concerns on deficit WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump proposed on Wednesday the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in three decades, calling for tax cuts for most Americans, but prompting criticism that the plan favors business and the rich and could add trillions of dollars to the deficit. The proposal drew a swift, skeptical response from Senator Bob Corker, a leading Republican â€œfiscal hawk,â€ who vowed not to vote for any federal tax package financed with borrowed money. â€œWhat I can tell you is that Iâ€™m not about to vote for any bill that increases our deficit, period,â€ Corker, who said on Tuesday he would not seek re-election in 2018, told reporters. Trump said his tax plan was aimed at helping working people, creating jobs and making the tax code simpler and fairer. But it faces an uphill battle in the U.S. Congress with Trumpâ€™s own Republican Party divided over it and Democrats hostile. The plan would lower corporate and small-business income tax rates, reduce the top income tax rate for high-earning American individuals and scrap some popular tax breaks, including one that benefits people in high-tax states dominated by Democrats. Forged during months of talks among Trumpâ€™s aides and top congressional Republicans, the plan contained few details on how to pay for the tax cuts without expanding the budget deficit and adding to the nationâ€™s $20 trillion national debt. The plan still must be turned into legislation, which was not expected until after Congress makes progress on the fiscal 2018 budget, perhaps in October. It must then be debated by the Republican-led congressional tax-writing committees. Analysts were skeptical that Congress could approve a tax bill this year, but that is what Republicans hope to achieve so they can enter next yearâ€™s congressional election campaigns with at least one legislative achievement to show for 2017. Financial markets rallied on the planâ€™s unveiling, an event long anticipated by traders betting that stocks would benefit from both faster economic growth and inflation. At an event in Indianapolis, Trump called the plan the largest tax cut in U.S. history. â€œWe want tax reform that is pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-worker, pro-family and, yes, tax reform that is pro-American,â€ he said. The real estate mogul-turned-politician, who promised big tax cuts as a candidate, told reporters he personally would not gain financially from the proposal. â€œI think thereâ€™s very little benefit for people of wealth,â€ said Trump, who unlike many of his White House predecessors, has refused to make public his own tax returns. Republicans have produced no major legislative successes since Trump took office in January, even though they control the White House and both chambers of Congress. Their top legislative priority, overhauling the U.S. healthcare system, collapsed again in the Senate on Tuesday. A comprehensive rewrite of the U.S. tax code has eluded previous presidents and Congress for decades. The last one was passed in 1986 under Republican President Ronald Reagan. Trumpâ€™s plan falls short of the sweeping, bipartisan package crafted by Reagan and congressional Democrats, analysts said. The White House said that, under the proposal, typical middle-class families would have less income subject to federal tax. Trump said the first $12,000 earned by an individual and the first $24,000 by a married couple would be tax-free. The plan would lower the top individual tax rate, paid by the nationâ€™s top earners, to 35 percent from 39.6 percent. It would lower the top corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from the current 35 percent. The existing rate is high globally, but many U.S.-based multinationals pay much less than the headline rate because of abundant loopholes and tax breaks. Trump has appealed to Democrats to back the plan, although they were not consulted in drafting it. Republicans hold a thin 52-48 Senate majority and may need some Democratic support to win passage. But Democrats said the plan would expand the federal deficit in order to deliver tax cuts to wealthy Americans rather than the middle-class families that Trump and Republicans say they are trying to help.  â€œIf this framework is all about the middle class, then Trump Tower is middle-class housing,â€ said Senator Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the tax law-writing Senate Finance Committee.      Republican Kevin Brady, chairman of the tax-writing House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee, said he expected tax legislation to be passed by the end of this year. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a Washington-based policy group, estimated on Wednesday the plan contained about $5.8 trillion of total tax cuts over a decade and would have a net cost of $2.2 trillion through 2027. Analysts have warned huge tax cuts would balloon the deficit if economic growth projected by Republicans to offset the costs fails to materialize amid rising interest rates. â€˜PASS-THROUGHâ€™ RATE The plan would set a new 25 percent tax rate for â€œpass-throughâ€ businesses, which are usually small, private enterprises, such as partnerships and sole proprietorships. They represent about 95 percent of all U.S. businesses. Under current law, the profits of those companies â€œpass throughâ€ directly to their owners and are taxed as personal income, often at the top 39.6 percent individual income rate. Cutting that to 25 percent could mean big tax savings for small-business owners, but also be vulnerable to abuse by other individuals and companies, analysts said. Republicans proposed eliminating some tax deductions. They did not target the popular ones for mortgage interest and charitable giving, but called for scrapping the one for state and local tax payments. That could especially hurt people in high-tax states like California and New York. In a step to simplify tax returns, the plan would shrink the current seven tax brackets to three: 12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent. That would raise the bottom tax rate on low-earning Americans to 12 percent from 10 percent, but analysts said other parts of the plan would still mean a net tax cut. ",Real
" Court Forces Ohio To Allow Millions Of Illegally Purged Voters Back On The Rolls Donald Trump is semi-right: this election might be rigged. However, this election is rigged against the people, not him.Take a look at Ohio, a key battleground state in the never-ending 2016 election. After purging more than two million voters from the roles, a high court smacked down Republican Secretary of State John Hustad for violating the National Voter Registration Act.Hustad s purge, which included some dead people and those who moved out of state, also included those who moved in the same county and those who have not voted in past elections (at least since 2011). Those who were purged were overwhelmingly black, low-income and Democratic voters. A Reuters investigation found that in the state s major cities (Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati) the voters in Democratic-leaning neighborhoods and precincts were illegally purged at twice the rate as in Republican.So, on Wednesday night, while everyone was watching the final presidential debate (in which Trump again claimed the election is rigged against him), the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, at the behest of Republican appointee Judge George C. Smith, ordered the voters   save the dead and moved   back onto the rolls immediately and have their voting rights restored.Judge Smith accused Hustad of voter disenfranchisement, writing:If those who were unlawfully removed from the voter rolls are not allowed to vote, then the Secretary of State is continuing to to disenfranchise voters in violation of federal law.The case was originally heard by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which also ruled against Hustad, but was sent back to the District Court for a rehearing. Obviously, both courts realized the illegal power grab by the state at the behest of the GOP, and they weren t having it.Time and time again the courts have struck down illegal rigging practices by the Republicans, thus saving the nation from an unbalanced electoral system. Voting is a right in this country, and partisan politicos should not have the power to take it away just because.If anyone can complain about a rigged election, it s Hillary Clinton.Featured image via John Sommers II/Getty Images",Fake
"Democrats say Trump agrees to work on immigration bill, wall in dispute WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump and Democratic leaders in the U.S. Congress have agreed to work together on legislation to protect â€œDreamers,â€ the illegal immigrants who were children when they entered the United States, the lawmakers said on Wednesday, although a dispute erupted over exactly what had been agreed. Following a dinner with Trump at the White House, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said the â€œproductive meetingâ€ focused on â€œDACA,â€ a program established by former President Barack Obama. â€œWe agreed to enshrine the protections of DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) into law quickly, and to work out a package of border security, excluding the wall, thatâ€™s acceptable to both sides,â€ Schumer and Pelosi said in a statement. All year, Democrats have insisted that they will block any legislation that contains funding for a wall along the length of the U.S. border with Mexico, a top Trump campaign goal that many Republicans in Congress also do not support. While White House officials have suggested legislation on DACA could move forward without wall funding, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders disputed the characterization that a deal had been reached to leave it out of any legislation focused on the Dreamers. â€œWhile DACA and border security were both discussed, excluding the wall was certainly not agreed to,â€ she said on Twitter. Throughout his 2016 campaign for president and since taking office in January, Trump has demanded the construction of a wall to keep out illegal immigrants and drugs. He initially said Mexico would pay for the wall but has requested money from the U.S. Congress after the government of Mexico refused to pay. The dinner was the latest effort in a new initiative by Trump to work with opposition party Democrats on major legislation. Following the dinner, a White House official said the president, Schumer and Pelosi discussed tax reform, immigration, border security, infrastructure investments and trade as part of Trumpâ€™s bid to reach out to Democrats. â€œThe administration looks forward to continuing these conversations with leadership on both sides of the aisle,â€ the official said. Over a dinner of Chinese food, Trump and the Democratic leaders also discussed issues related to U.S.-China trade, according to a congressional aide briefed on the meeting. Schumer and Pelosi also said that they urged Trump to make permanent government subsidy payments under the Affordable Care Act, also known as â€œObamacare.â€ â€œThose discussions will continue,â€ the lawmakers said. Trump and most Republicans in Congress have demanded the repeal of Obamacare but have been unable to agree on a replacement for the healthcare program that became law in 2010. Using his executive powers, Trump canceled Obamaâ€™s DACA program in which about 800,000 undocumented young people have escaped the threat of deportation and been able to apply for work permits in the United States. Trump argued that Obama over-stepped his authority in creating the program. But Trump gave Congress six months to come up with a replacement program in the form of legislation to be enacted into law. Democratic Representative Henry Cuellar, who attended a White House meeting with Trump earlier on Wednesday, told reporters the president said he would not insist on wall funding as part of a Dreamers bill, but would pursue it on other, future legislation. Cuellar said Trump urged lawmakers to link a Republican bill to cut legal immigration to the United States with protections for Dreamers. But many Democrats oppose lowering the cap on annual legal immigration. ",Real
"France says pressure needed to stop North Korea crossing next nuclear hurdle PARIS (Reuters) - France said on Wednesday it was imperative the United Nations Security Council apply more pressure on North Korea to prevent it jumping another hurdle toward an effective nuclear weapons capacity that could lead to a dangerous military escalation. Amid heightened tension on the Korean peninsula, North Korea has escalated a war of words with the United States, warning of full-out nuclear war if Washington takes military action against it over its nuclear and missile ambitions. â€œWe have to avoid all military escalation,â€ Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault told LCP television. â€œThis threatens nuclear proliferation in the region, but also directly threatens North America. Itâ€™s a major danger.â€ Ayrault, who was in China last week and whose country has no diplomatic representation in North Korea, said it appeared that Beijing was increasingly worried by the behavior of its neighbor. â€œChina is scared of chaos and destabilization of the regime that would result in millions of refugees in the region so we can make progress through international pressure ... sanctions and discussions between the Security Council members to take measures,â€ he said.  U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said on Wednesday that Washington would work with its allies and China to put economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea but added that America would defeat any attack with an â€œoverwhelming responseâ€. â€œThere is no time to lose because all of the money North Korea has is being used for nuclear investment and research which would enable the country to jump another hurdle,â€ he said.

" BUSTED: Trump Supporter Used Poll Watcher Credentials To Force Early Voters To Leave Polling Place Clearly, there is no low Trump supporters won t stoop in the effort to get him elected president.Ever since the Republican nominee told his deplorable supporters that the election is  rigged  and that they should become poll watchers there has been multiple incidents of voter intimidation, voter suppression, and voter fraud by Trump supporters and even an act of violence against a polling place.And another Trump supporter just got caught trying to intimidate early voters into leaving an Arkansas polling place.Thus far, early voting has benefited Hillary Clinton and that s a big deal with only four days left until Election Day. So Jefferson County Election Commission Stu Soffer, who is a Trump supporter, used his poll watcher credentials and stood in a doorway to yell at early voters at the Pine Bluff polling location to leave. Shut up and go home,  Soffer yelled while blocking the entrance to the voting booths according to Jefferson County Clerk Patricia Johnson and a voter named Victor who did not get to cast his ballot because of Soffer s interference. As a result of the disruption and confusion caused by Stu Soffer and other Republicans   I was not able to cast my ballot that day,  Victor said.According to attorney Chris Burke, who represents Victor in the lawsuit filed against Soffer,  Mr. Soffer stood in the doorway of the early-voting location and told voters to shut up and go home. As a result, Victor and many other voters were unable to cast their votes that day. This is deeply troubling to the voters of Jefferson County and also to the election administrators whose job it is to administer the elections free of fear and intimidation,  Burke added.This is just the latest incident of a Trump supporter trying to rig the election for Donald Trump.In Green Bay, Wisconsin a city clerk tried to deny a request for an extra polling place near the local university solely on the grounds that she believes college students are more likely to vote for Democrats.In Iowa, a Trump supporter literally got caught trying to vote twice and was arrested.And a right-wing group is creating fake badges so they can infiltrate polling places in order to intimidate voters on Election Day for Trump.These incidents, including this recent one in Arkansas prove that Trump supporters are trying to rig the election for their candidate and it s only going to get worse in the days ahead, especially on Election Day as conservatives desperately try to secure a victory for the Republican nominee by hook or by crook.Featured Image: Facebook",Fake
"Fatal Niger operation sparks calls for public hearings in Congress WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic U.S. lawmakers called on Thursday for public hearings on an attack in Niger that killed four U.S. soldiers, saying there were still many unanswered questions about the ambush despite receiving more information from the Pentagon. Two top Department of Defense officials, Robert Karem, assistant secretary for international security affairs, and Major General Albert Elton, deputy director for special operations and counterterrorism, conducted a closed briefing on the ambush for members of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Senator John McCain, the Republican chairman of the committee, said he was pleased with the briefing. McCain last week threatened to issue a subpoena because the White House had not been forthcoming about details about the attack. â€œI am pleased at the cooperation weâ€™re getting now,â€ McCain told reporters. McCain said there were still many unanswered questions, most notably why it took 48 hours before the body of Sargent La David Johnson was recovered. â€œWhat was the strategy; why were we surprised? Thereâ€™s 100 questions that need to be answered,â€ McCain said. The issue has also generated a political firestorm. President Donald Trump was harshly criticized for his handling of a call with Myeshia Johnson, Johnsonâ€™s widow, who said the Republican president â€œmade me cry even worseâ€ by saying her husband had known â€œwhat he signed up for.â€ Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democratic committee member, said he wanted public hearings on the matter to explain to the U.S. public why the country has 6,000 troops posted in Africa and provide more information about the ambush. â€œI need to be able to look families in the eye and explain what our mission is, what mistakes were made in this incident, and were mistakes made, who made them and why,â€ Blumenthal told reporters after the briefing. â€œMost important, there need to be public hearings,â€ he said. McCain said he would decide whether to hold public hearings depending on what happened with the militaryâ€™s investigation, citing security concerns about making anything public too soon. â€œWe canâ€™t betray sensitive information that would put the lives of these men and women in danger,â€ McCain said. On Monday, General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the militaryâ€™s Joint Chiefs of Staff, held an hour-long news conference during which he sought to tamp down criticism that the Pentagon had released too little information about the deaths of the soldiers.

" Corker Has Last Word On Day Care Donnie: â€˜On The Path To WWIIIâ€™ Tennessee Republican Senator Bob Corker announced last month that he wouldn t be seeking reelection when his term expires at the end of next year, but now President Donald Trump and Corker have had a public falling out on Trump s beloved platform, Twitter.It all kicked off on Sunday morning when Trump posted a series of tweets claiming that he denied Corker s request for an endorsement. Todd Womack, Corker s chief of staff, refuted the claim later in the day, saying in a statement that the President called Senator Corker on Monday afternoon and asked him to reconsider his decision not to seek reelection and reaffirmed that he would have endorsed him, as he has said many times. Trump s Corker-directed fit of tweet-rage came just days after the Senator publicly criticized the President, a move that never sits well with Trump, leading him to try and seek revenge:Senator Bob Corker ""begged"" me to endorse him for re-election in Tennessee. I said ""NO"" and he dropped out (said he could not win without  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 8, 2017..my endorsement). He also wanted to be Secretary of State, I said ""NO THANKS.""

However, he wasn t going to let an opportunity like this go to waste and decided to respond to the President s barbs, calling the current administration out for being exactly how many see it:It's a shame the White House has become an adult day care center. Someone obviously missed their shift this morning.  Senator Bob Corker (@SenBobCorker) October 8, 2017Corker later decided enough was enough and opted to tell it like it is in a phone interview with The New York Times on Sunday night, claiming that Trump was treating the presidency like  a reality show,  making reckless threats against other countries that put the United States  on the path to World War III. He concerns me,  Mr. Corker said.  He would have to concern anyone who cares about our nation,  he said. He was far from done.  I know for a fact that every single day at the White House, it s a situation of trying to contain him,  the Senator said in the interview.When it came to the tweets, Corker simply confirmed what we already knew.

"Trump 'dossier' firm: Republicans leaked bank records in retaliation WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A firm that commissioned a â€œdossierâ€ detailing links between then-presidential candidate Donald Trumpâ€™s campaign and Russia said in a court filing that Republicans leaked the companyâ€™s banking data to the media for partisan political purposes. Democrats have said Republicans use leaks to undermine investigations into Trumpâ€™s campaign both by Congress and Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Republicans have accused Democrats of leaking information to undermine the Trump administration. Republican attacks on Muellerâ€™s probe of U.S. allegations that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to help Trump and possible collusion with Moscow officials have included efforts to discredit the dossier. The Kremlin denies the allegations of meddling and Trump denies any collusion. Fusion GPS, in a notice to a federal judge in Washington late on Tuesday, said that a subpoena sent by the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee and its chairman, Devin Nunes, to the firmâ€™s bank was â€œpart of an ongoing effort to discredit Fusion in retaliation for its role in undertaking researchâ€ into Trump during the election. Fusionâ€™s court document said that information its founder, Glenn Simpson, provided to the committee during closed door testimony in November then surfaced in media reports. Nunes and Representative Mike Conaway, the Republican panel member who has led some of its Trump-related investigations, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Â   Information Simpson provided to the committee that was reported in the media included Simpson meeting with Bruce Ohr, a senior Justice Department official, the court document said. Ohr had been assigned to the office of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the prosecutor who appointed Mueller to lead the Russia probe. Ohr has been moved out of Rosensteinâ€™s office to a Justice Department unit dealing with drugs and organized crime, the department said. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Ohr meeting with Simpson. Fusion also complained about a Fox News report which said Ohrâ€™s wife, Nellie Ohr, had worked as a subcontractor for Fusion. An expert on Russia and the former Soviet Union who studied at Harvard and Stanford universities, her dealings with Fusion were confidential until Simpson told the closed committee hearing about them, the court filing said. Nellie Ohr could not immediately be reached for comment. A spokeswoman for Fusion GPS said she had done work for the firm. A source familiar with Fusionâ€™s work said the Ohrs are experts on Russian organized crime, which is how they came in contact with Simpson and Christopher Steele, a former BritishÂ intelligence officer who compiled the dossier.Â  Trump and his supporters have denied the dossierâ€™s contents outlining Russian financial and personal links to Trumpâ€™s campaign.Â   ",Real
" WATCH: Texas Pastor Angers Parents, Tells Children That Santa Isnâ€™t Real While Trying To Indoctrinate Them At A Mall Right-wing pastors are the ones really waging war on Christmas.A crazy  Christian  pastor in Texas decided to ruin Christmas for all the little boys and girls at a mall in Amarillo and filmed himself doing so as horrified parents looked on.David Grisham Jr. walked into the mall and began filming himself delivering unsolicited preaching to children who were there to see Santa Claus.The Last Frontier Evangelism leader laid out his plan to tell kids that Santa is a fake all while insisting that Jesus is real. The man you re going to see today is just a man in a suit, dressed up like Santa, but Santa does not exist,  Grisham said.  Parents, y all need to stop lying to your children and telling them that Santa Claus is real when, in fact, he s not. Grisham continued to repeat that Santa isn t real and told parents they should be teaching them about Jesus instead. When you substitute the lie of Santa Claus in the heart of your child for the truth of Jesus Christ, you are bearing false witness against God. Don t lie to your children and tell them there s such a thing as Santa, when you know in reality that there are no flying reindeer, there is no workshop at the North Pole, there is no elves making toys, that you buy all the gifts and put them under the tree. Some angry fathers confronted Grisham to make his leave. Quit talking this mess, you understand me?  one man tells Grisham.  Now stop. I ve got my kids over there, we don t need you coming over here and blabbing whatever the hell you re blabbing. Now go on   go. Now. That s not your decision to tell my kids what s the truth and what s not. Here s the video via YouTube.This is the example of the so-called  war on Christmas  that Fox News has been looking for, but they won t report on it because it s a conservative pastor waging it.In fact, there is more evidence that Santa Claus is real than there is that Jesus is real.While scholars rely on the Bible as their source for Jesus  existence, the person we call Santa Claus today was born Nikolaos of Myra in 3rd century Greece and was declared a saint during the 4th century. Saint Nicholas is reputed to have performed miracles, and his reputation for secretly giving gifts to people in need gave rise to the story of Santa Claus. Over time the life of Saint Nick was blended with Nordic folktales that have turned into the story of Santa we know so well today. Sure, the story of Santa Claus has changed through the centuries to include a sleigh, flying reindeer, milk and cookies, going down chimneys, elves making toys, and living at the North Pole, but Santa is still based in reality and there is evidence that he existed.Featured Image: Screenshot",Fake
"Republicans eye alternatives for getting to 20 percent corporate tax rate WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican lawmakers are considering indirect paths to meeting President Donald Trumpâ€™s goal of slashing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent, one of the toughest challenges they face in trying to overhaul the U.S. tax code. Tax writers in the House of Representatives may opt to phase in the 20 percent corporate rate over three to five years by lowering it in stages from the current 35 percent, said two sources close to the tax discussions. A phase-in surfaced as an option among Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee as it closed in on completion of actual tax legislation, working off of a nine-page â€œframeworkâ€ unveiled by Trump on Sept. 27. The House was expected to be inactive on Friday and all of next week. â€œWeâ€™ll come back in a week and be able to put together the bill that will move through committee,â€ Republican Representative Kristi NoemÂ told reporters. One of the biggest problems confronting the Republican tax reform push is the federal budget deficit, which would be hugely expanded by Trumpâ€™s proposals, according to independent analyses. Cutting the corporate rate immediately to 20 percent would reduce U.S. tax revenues by nearly $2 trillion over a decade, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center think tank. Sources said House Republicans believed they could halve the projected revenue loss if the rate cut were phased in. Details of such an option were unavailable. The administration contends the cuts would pay for themselves through stronger economic growth generating new tax revenues, although most economists say that is unlikely. A different approach may emerge from the Senate, where Republicans are writing their own tax legislation. Sources with knowledge of the discussions said senators might settle on a corporate tax rate above 20 percent, but use an unorthodox â€œcorporate integrationâ€ strategy to achieve an effective rate of 20 percent or less. Corporate integration, a brainchild of Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, would help lower corporationsâ€™ tax bill by giving them a deduction for shareholder dividends, analysts said. The idea has faced opposition in the past.  Both the House and Senate alternatives surfaced this week as top Republicans and Trump administration officials confronted skepticism that the Republican-controlled Congress could cut the corporate rate to 20 percent without ballooning the deficit.  Trump, who earlier in the year called for a 15 percent corporate tax rate and only reluctantly agreed to 20 percent, is now insisting that it go no higher.   â€œThe president has made it clear. He wants 20 percent. Thatâ€™s the one part of this bill thatâ€™s not negotiable,â€ Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady told reporters on Thursday: â€œWe continue to drive toward the framework ... ensuring that our businesses donâ€™t have anything higher than 20 percent on the corporate side.â€ Asked if that meant a 20 percent rate in the first year, he said: â€œWeâ€™re moving toward that whole design.â€ ",Real
" REPORT: Sean Spicer Forces Staffers To Surrender Phones In Search Of Leakers Donald Trump s paranoia and desperation to keep the American people in the dark just took an unconstitutional turn.For weeks, various news outlets have obtained inside information from White House sources such as memos and descriptions of what is going on behind the scenes. That s how we know about what executive orders Trump is considering and how we know about the chaos and infighting that has been plaguing Trump s administration. It s also how we know more about Trump s Russia scandal.Rather than address his executive orders or the chaos in the White House or his Russia scandal, Trump would rather whine about the leaks instead.The real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of Washington? Will these leaks be happening as I deal on N.Korea etc?  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 14, 2017Information is being illegally given to the failing @nytimes & @washingtonpost by the intelligence community (NSA and FBI?).Just like Russia  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2017The real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by  intelligence  like candy. Very un-American!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2017You know what is really un-American? Forcing your staffers to hand over their phones for an inspection.According to a report by Politico, White House mouthpiece Sean Spicer actually confiscated the phones of his staff to go through them in order to make sure they are not leaking any information to the press.Of course, if someone had refused to hand over their phone they would have more than likely lost their job so they definitely didn t volunteer to give their phones up. They had to do it out of fear.The staffers were called to an  emergency meeting  and told to place any electronic device they had on them on a table, including personal cell phones, so they could be searched.But the Constitution specifically bars such illegal searches and seizures.The Fourth Amendment states, The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized. In other words, if Trump really thinks the leaks are  illegal,  he should have to get a warrant to search the phones of his employees. But he didn t, which means his search is illegal and in violation of the constitutional rights of his staffers. Trump and Spicer can hardly call the confiscation voluntary either since many of these staffers probably believed they would be fired if they did not hand over their phones. That means they were forced to do so, and they can file a lawsuit for having their privacy violated.Once again, Donald Trump and his team are violating the Constitution. Republicans in Congress cannot continue to allow Trump to trample our constitutional rights. It s time to investigate and impeach him. Because at this rate, he ll literally be ripping up the Constitution if he isn t stopped.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",Fake
" Dan Rather Has SHOCKING Response After Trump Sides With Assange Over America (TWEET) Legendary reporter Dan Rather has commented on the ridiculous antics of President-elect Donald Trump before, but it seems as though Trump s foolishness and erratic behavior has finally struck a nerve that Rather can t shake off.Earlier today, Trump sent out a tweet that took the side of Julian Assange after the WikiLeaks founder claimed he had not gotten the Democratic National Committee s emails from Russia in an interview with Fox News. Trump pathetically used this information to defend Russia despite the fact that multiple intelligence reports have pointed right to the Kremlin.In response to this, Rather took to Facebook to rip Trump a new one for his  cavalier dismissal  of Russia s involvement in the U.S. election. Rather didn t mince his words, perfectly stating what many of us are feeling at this point, as our future President sides with our adversaries. Rather wrote: Stunned disbelief. Anxiety. A mounting sense of betrayal. These are the smoke signals rising from those in and around the United States intelligence community over President-elect Donald Trump s dismissal of the evidence of Russian hacking in the presidential election. Rather blasted Trump for trusting Assange over America s own intelligence communities, remarking on Trump s stupidity for trusting someone who clearly doesn t have the United States  best interest in mind: Assange, in an interview with Fox News  Sean Hannity (who at this point must be considered a full-fledged propagandist and abetter) said he didn t get the information from Russia. Well if he says so  Let s just use that same standard for all of our adversaries. Nothing to see here. Why waste all these billions of dollars on intelligence gathering? Rather also raised a question that many of us have been wondering when he asked how the many  people risking their lives  and using their  immense analytical skills   instead of   making millions on Wall Street  feel about  Mr. Trump s cavalier dismissal of their work. Rather perfectly stated that Trump s denial and refusal of the intelligence reports is dangerous and  affects all Americans, and people around the world.  The legendary reporter called on Trump s fellow Republicans and advisers to knock some sense into the President-elect: Hopefully patriots within Mr. Trump s own party and in his inner circle will step up and tell the incoming president how dangerous this rhetoric is. Heaven forbid we suffer another horrible attack. Heaven forbid our intelligence community was hollowed out, wasn t listened to or respected. These are the stakes. No one could have said it better.

"Senate race in Alabama exposes Republican rift (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is due to travel to Alabama on Friday to whip up votes in a Senate race that has laid bare the rift between the Republican partyâ€™s leadership and its anti-establishment wing. In a move that surprised political analysts, Trump will appear alongside the party-approved incumbent rather than the controversial insurgent. The presidentâ€™s decision to campaign for Senator Luther Strange ahead of Tuesdayâ€™s primary runoff election came despite Trumpâ€™s strained relationship with Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, one of Strangeâ€™s strongest supporters.  In last monthâ€™s initial round of voting, Strange finished second to former Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore, whose â€œdrain the swampâ€ credentials have been burnished by high-profile endorsements, including that of former White House strategist Steve Bannon. â€œI think that if you were to approach this without any prior knowledge ... Judge Moore would be the more logical â€˜Trumpianâ€™ candidate,â€ said Steven Taylor, a political science professor at Troy University in Alabama. The winner on Tuesday will be running in December against Democratic candidate Doug Jones in the Republican-dominated state. Neither Republican campaign responded to requests for comment. Moore, 70, is a religious conservative who twice lost his position as the stateâ€™s top judge. He was ousted in 2003 after he refused a federal court order to remove a Ten Commandments monument from the state Supreme Court building. After winning back the seat in 2013, he directed state judges to ignore the U.S. Supreme Courtâ€™s ruling legalizing same-sex marriage, was suspended and then resigned. Moore has vowed to support Trumpâ€™s agenda and has blamed McConnell for the Senateâ€™s lack of major legislative victories. A Moore campaign video released last week showed a photo of McConnell beside the words â€œWashington insidersâ€ as Mooreâ€™s wife warned he would not â€œbend his knee.â€ Strange, 64, was appointed to fill the Senate seat left vacant when Jeff Sessions became U.S. attorney general. Known as â€œBig Lutherâ€ due to his 6-foot-9-inch stature, he has been backed by nearly $9 million of advertising from a McConnell-allied political action committee. â€œI am supporting â€˜Bigâ€™ Luther Strange because he was so loyal & helpful to me!â€ Trump tweeted on Wednesday. Strange served as state attorney general under former Governor Robert Bentley, who resigned in April. Moore has endured his share of controversy, including negative press this week after he mentioned â€œredsâ€ and â€œyellowsâ€ in an apparent reference to American Indians and Asians.  In a recent advertisement, Strange questioned Mooreâ€™s commitment to Trumpâ€™s planned wall at the Mexican border. â€œRoy Moore: wrong on President Trump, wrong on the wall, wrong for Alabama,â€ the adâ€™s narrator says.     The two candidates are scheduled to square off at their only debate on Thursday. With turnout expected to be low for Tuesdayâ€™s runoff, Troy Universityâ€™s Taylor said both campaigns have reason to believe they hold an edge. â€œMooreâ€™s advantage is that he does appeal to the true-believing base,â€ Taylor said. â€œIn terms of which of the campaigns is going to be more adept at the ground game, I would think Strange has an advantage.â€ ",Real
" WATCH: Kellyanne Conway Says Worldwide Chaos Is A â€˜Small Price To Payâ€™ For Banning Muslims Donald Trump stooge Kellyanne Conway attempted to defend the unconstitutional Muslim ban on Sunday and failed miserably.On Friday, Trump signed an executive order banning immigrants from Yemen, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Syria, Somalia, and Libya from entering the United States.The order instantly caused mass chaos as businesses rushed to call back employees from overseas and airports became detention centers. Even people with green cards, which makes them American citizens, are being barred from entering the country.During an interview with Fox News host Chris Wallace, Conway ignored the worldwide chaos and actually had the gall to call it a good thing that somehow makes America safer. You re talking about 325,000 people from overseas came into this country just yesterday through our airports,  Conway said when Wallace asked if Trump made a mistake by not thinking about the consequences of the order. You re talking about three hundred and some who have been detained or are prevented from gaining access to an aircraft in their home countries and must stay for now. That s 1 percent. And I think in terms of the upside being greater protection of our borders, of our people, it s a small price to pay. Here s the video via YouTube:Except that Trump s Muslim ban does not make America safer at all. In fact, it makes us less safe because extremists will use the ban as proof that America hates Muslims, which will be the perfect recruitment tool for terrorist organizations.For instance, this is how Iran responded to the order. While respecting the American people and distinguishing between them and the hostile policies of the U.S. government, Iran will implement the principle of reciprocity until the offensive U.S. limitations against Iranian nationals are lifted. The restrictions against travel by Muslims to America  are an open affront against the Muslim world and the Iranian nation in particular and will be known as a great gift to extremists. So we can expect terrorist organizations like ISIS to use Trump s ban as a recruiting tool to persuade more people to align with them and commit acts of terrorism against the United States and nothing Trump does will stop them because his administration is far too incompetent to do so.The ban also would not have prevented any of the mass shootings conservatives point to as justification for the ban such as shootings in Ft. Hood, Orlando, and San Bernardino, because all of the shooters were natural born United States citizens.And Trump s ban did not include nations that are actually responsible for killing American citizens, such as Saudi Arabia, where the 9/11 hijackers were from and received funding.This Muslim ban is totally unconstitutional and targets people because of their religion. It goes against our values as a nation and every American should be horrified by what Trump has done. Our reputation around the world has just been sullied and we are going to pay a price in blood for it.Featured image via screenshot",Fake
"Bond between Trump, Xi in meetings played role in China abstention: U.S. official WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior Trump administration official said on Wednesday that the positive bond developed between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping last week in Florida helped lead to Chinaâ€™s abstention from a U.N. Security Council vote on Syria. The official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity, would not say whether Trump personally asked Xi that China not veto the resolution. The official said Xiâ€™s decision not to veto the resolution spoke to Chinaâ€™s determination not to obstruct the U.N.â€™s ability to sanction Syria for a chemical weapons attack last week. ",Real

As per usual when we get these early morning, unhinged rants from Trump, he is on the attack   this time with an old foe, The New York Times. As we all know, Trump has long had a frosty relationship with the media, and even invited them to Trump Tower only to rant at them about how he doesn t like how they covered him. Now, he has cancelled a meeting with the Times, the news organization that he had the most criticism for.

If they don t, we can kiss our democracy goodbye, because we just elected a literal fascist.

" A Trump Fan Picks A Fight On A Plane, So The Captain Issues SCATHING Rebuke As much as we activists might wish otherwise, it s not always a good idea to talk politics. This is particularly true if you re a insecure idiot Trumpkin who just has to say something stupid and racist to the passenger next to you on a plane. This actually happened on a United Airlines flight from San Francisco to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, where a Trump supporter scared the passenger next to him by gloating about the Cheeto King s win.According to the caption on the YouTube video, this Trump fan was wearing a plaid shirt and a camo cap, and he just had to say something about being happy that he could keep his guns to the black woman next to him. She began to cry likely because that sounds an awful lot like a threat, and the racism and racist threats that have been oozing out of Trumpkins since Nov. 8 is just vile.The two were separated, and then the pilot gave the entire plane a very stern talking to, thanks to said Trump fan: We re going to be in a metal tube at 35,000 feet to bring up politics. Okay? I understand everybody has their opinions, that s fine.Nobody wants to argue, nobody s going to change their minds by arguing, and let s keep our opinions to ourselves on this particular matter at this particular time.If there s anybody that has a problem with this, that needs to vent or rant or rave, there s another flight tomorrow. You re not going to be on this one. I hope that s clear. He got a lot of cheers for that.While some might interpret his full remarks as insensitive and even pro-Trump, he actually did what he needed to do to defuse the situation.

"Russia probe should focus on Trump financial ties: senator WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. Senate investigation into Russiaâ€™s meddling during the U.S. election should include a thorough review of any financial ties between Russia and President Donald Trump and his associates, Democratic senator Ron Wyden said Wednesday. In a formal written request made to the leaders of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, Wyden said financial relationships between Trump, a real estate developer with properties around the world, and Russia are deserving of scrutiny because of resistance by Trump and some in his orbit have not been forthcoming about their finances. â€œEfforts to understand these relationships and to separate fact from speculation have been hampered by the opacity of the finances of President Trump and his associates,â€ Wyden, who also sits on the intelligence panel, wrote to Republican Richard Burr and Democrat Mark Warner.  The letter, though devoid of new details, is the latest piece of evidence suggesting Trumpâ€™s business dealings are attracting expanded interest from investigators amid a raft of new reports scrutinizing potential financial entanglements between the president and Russia.  Trump has declined to release his tax returns, bucking decades of precedent for presidents and presidential candidates. The letter followed new disclosures in recent weeks of previously unknown meetings and financial arrangements between Trumpâ€™s associates and wealthy Russians, and came as Democrats attempt to focus public attention on questions about Trumpâ€™s connections to Russia. On Monday, the state development bank Vnesheconombank disclosed that its executives had met Jared Kushner, Trumpâ€™s son-in-law and a top White House adviser, in December. And last week Paul Manafort, Trumpâ€™s former campaign chairman, admitted he had done business work for Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska. Trump has repeatedly insisted allegations that he or members of his administration have an untoward relationship with Russia as â€œfake news.â€ He has also said that he has no business deals in Russia.     A Reuters investigation published earlier this month found that dozens of members of the Russian elite have bought at least $98.4 million worth of property in seven Trump-branded luxury towers in southern Florida, according to public documents, interviews and corporate records. Wyden has repeatedly tried to push into public light more information about U.S. investigations into Russiaâ€™s role in the 2016 election. He organized a two-sentence letter from seven senators to the White House last November asking the outgoing Obama administration to declassify additional information about Russiaâ€™s interference in the election. Then-president Barack Obama announced a review of Russiaâ€™s activities soon after. U.S. intelligence agencies later released a review of its assessment of Russiaâ€™s multi-pronged influence campaign, concluding Moscowâ€™s actions were intended to help Trump win and discredit his opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton. Russia has denied the allegations. Wyden in January also asked Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey if his agency was investigating links between Russia and associates of Trump. Comey declined to answer, but last week confirmed the FBI was probing possible ties. Examining finances has long been within the purview of the oversight role of the intelligence panel, Wyden wrote, citing a recent committee report said that â€œfinancial intelligence has emerged as a significant area of (intelligence community) activity, aiming to â€˜follow the moneyâ€™ of adversaries.â€  ",Real

" Trumpâ€™s Latest Tweet Has A GLARING Mistake That Shows How Stupid (Or PSYCHOTIC) He Is (TWEET) It was hard to imagine Donald Trump getting any dumber during his presidential campaign, but he s truly outdone himself in the weeks after winning the election. Not only has the President-elect been unintelligently tweeting up a storm, ditching protocol press pools and making every attempt to hide the $25 million lawsuit he just settled for fraud, but he is letting America know that he has no idea what presidents actually do.We ve seen Trump s complete ignorance of widely known facts before, like the time he told his own supporters the incorrect voting date. At a Florida rally, Trump had   with full confidence   told his fanbase to vote on November 28th, a full 20 days off from the real voting date. Today, Trump reminded us of this moment when he reinforced the fact that he STILL doesn t know what s going on.This morning, Trump notified everyone over Twitter that there would be a meeting at Trump Tower today with the people (aka the white supremacists)  who will run our government  for the next EIGHT years. Huh? Great meetings will take place today at Trump Tower concerning the formation of the people who will run our government for the next 8 years. TwitterEither Trump is completely unaware that a President s term is only four years, or he s completely delusional about how long he s actually going to last in the White House. We wouldn t be surprised if Trump thinks one term is actually 8 years, considering how clueless he is and his lack of knowledge about the United States Constitution, which clearly says: The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America. He shall hold his Office during the Term of four Years, and, together with the Vice-President chosen for the same Term For him to think that he s going to have the success that President Obama had and be elected for two terms is hilarious. Obama has a tremendously high approval rating, and Trump s approval rating is historically LOW. He s certainly in for a rude awakening if he thinks he s got eight years of dictatorship ahead of him.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",Fake

"Wilbur Ross seen imposing Mexico sugar deal over industry objections WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is likely to impose a new sugar trade deal with Mexico even if final revisions to it fail to win support from the U.S. industry, trade lawyers and experts say. After announcing a deal this week that would dramatically cut the amount of refined sugar that Mexico ships to the United States, officials from the two countries are working with their industries on final language that would govern its operation. At issue is a new right of first refusal granted to Mexico to supply all U.S. sugar needs not met by domestic suppliers or other foreign quota holders. A coalition of American sugar cane and beet farmers and a major refiner want a more explicit guarantee that the U.S. Department of Agriculture, not Mexican producers, will dictate what type of sugar fills that gap. They are worried that a flood of refined sugar will pour in, rather than the raw sugar needed to keep U.S. mills running. The final sticking point stands in the way of resolving a years-long dispute over Mexican access to the highly regulated U.S. sugar market, which is protected by a complex web of subsidies and rationed quotas for foreign producers.  The sugar industry is known for its sway in Washington. But its point of view on Mexican imports is not shared by sugar users such as confectioners and soda makers.  The Trump administration wants to clear away the sugar dispute and a lumber trade row with Canada before starting full-scale negotiations to revise the North American Free Trade Agreement. An industry rarely objects to a government-negotiated  settlement of its anti-dumping case, and U.S. sugar producers could do little to stop the Commerce Department from implementing a final deal after a two-week comment period, said Seattle-based trade lawyer William Perry, who previously worked at Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Commission. While the industry could ask the International Trade Commission to overturn the settlement that suspends anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duty orders issued in 2014, chances for success look slim. The panel in 2015 rejected a challenge by two sugar refiners to the previous U.S.-Mexico pact. â€œPetitioners are never entirely happy with suspension agreements like this,â€ Perry said. â€œThey would rather have anti-dumping and countervailing duty orders with rates high enough to shut out imports.â€ A Commerce spokesman said that Ross hoped the U.S. sugar industry would ultimately endorse the final agreement. Gary Hufbauer, a trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the administration was probably willing to compromise on some industry-specific concerns to help reach its larger NAFTA goals of reducing U.S. trade deficits. The U.S. sugar industry must probably present evidence of new Mexican dumping before going back to Commerce for more changes to the deal, said Daniel Pearson, a senior fellow of the libertarian Cato Institute and former International Trade Commission chairman. â€œThey would do well to take this agreement and run with it and see how it works,â€ Pearson said, noting that it raises prices and keeps U.S. refiners well-supplied with raw sugar. Mexico made major concessions to maintain its access to the lucrative U.S. market, agreeing to ship no less than 70 percent of its quota volume as raw sugar to U.S. refineries. It gave ground on nearly all of the U.S. producersâ€™ demands.  American Sugar Alliance spokesman Phillip Hayes said the final hurdle should be easy to address by making clear that the USDA, not Mexico, can dictate the type and purity level of any additional imports. But Juan Cortina, head of Mexicoâ€™s main sugar trade group,  said there was no problem with the language because any additional needs would filled with raw sugar, as Mexican producers would have to keep higher inventories of that grade.

"State funding changes in spotlight in Republican healthcare bill WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican leaders sought to nail down the final votes needed to pass what U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday called their â€œlast best chanceâ€ to repeal Obamacare while a new analysis underscored how Democratic-leaning states stand to lose large amounts of federal funding under the legislation. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell plans to bring the bill introduced by fellow Republican Senators Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy to a vote next week, as his party seeks to make good on seven years of promises to erase Democratic former President Barack Obamaâ€™s signature legislative achievement. With no Democratic support for the bill, Republicans remain a handful of votes short in the Senate, needing 50 votes in a 100-seat chamber they control 52-48, with Pence casting a potential tie-breaking vote. Senator Rand Paul opposes it and at least six others are undecided: John McCain, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Dan Sullivan, Rob Portman and Jerry Moran. Asked whether the legislation will pass, Pence said, â€œWeâ€™ll see. Weâ€™re close.â€ Republicans, still reeling from their failure in July to win Senate passage of previous legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare, have set a Sept. 30 deadline for passage of this bill. â€œThis may well be our last best chance to stop and turn around and head America back in the direction of the kind of healthcare reform thatâ€™s based on individual-choice, state-based innovations,â€ Pence told Fox New Channel. President Donald Trump has been pushing Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare, which would fulfill one of his top campaign promises from last year. The current bill would take money that the federal government now spends on healthcare through the Medicaid insurance program for the poor and subsidies to help Americans buy private insurance and distribute it to the states in block grants. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office has not yet assessed the billâ€™s effects but independent analyses indicate it would fundamentally redistribute federal healthcare money, generally with Republican-leaning states benefiting and Democratic-leaning states losing. The nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation, a healthcare research group, estimated on Thursday that states that expanded Medicaid under Obamacare would lose $180 billion under the bill from 2020 to 2026, while non-expansion states would gain $73 billion in the same time period. The Graham-Cassidy bill in 2020 would end the Obamacare Medicaid expansion, which many Democratic-governed states had carried out while many Republican-governed states did not, and limit overall federal spending on the five-decade-old program regardless of how many Americans qualify for its benefits. Republicans have called Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, a federal overreach, and say block grants would give states discretion on how to provide healthcare coverage. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation analysis, five states would stand to lose more than 30 percent of their federal healthcare money from 2020-2026: New York (down 35 percent), Oregon (down 32 percent), Connecticut (down 31 percent), Vermont (down 31 percent) and Minnesota (down 30 percent). All are Democratic leaning. The analysis found that six Republican-leaning states would get at least 40 percent more in federal funds: Mississippi (up 148 percent), Texas (up 75 percent), Kansas (up 61 percent), Georgia (up 46 percent), South Dakota (up 45 percent) and Tennessee (up 44 percent). In total dollars, the state with the largest forecast loss of funds is California, losing $56 billion. The biggest gainer would be Texas, with a $34 billion increase. California, the most populous U.S. state, is Democratic leaning. Texas is the second most populous state and the largest Republican-leaning one. â€œItâ€™s absolutely true to say the Graham-Cassidy bill over time levels out on a per-person basis the way we distribute money on healthcare, which I think resonates with most Americans,â€ Pence said. McCain, Collins and Murkowski were the three Republicans who voted against the last Republican healthcare legislation brought up in the Senate, which failed 51-49 in July. Paul, who voted in favor of that bill after previously expressing misgivings, on Thursday went to Twitter to underscore his criticism that the Graham-Cassidy bill does not go far enough to erase Obamacare. The insurance industry, hospitals, medical advocacy groups such as the American Medical Association, American Heart Association and American Cancer Society, the AARP advocacy group for the elderly and consumer activists have come out against the bill, urging a bipartisan fix to the current law that was abandoned this week. More medical and civil rights advocacy groups lined up against the Graham-Cassidy bill on Thursday, including the American Psychological Association, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the NAACP.  The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank, estimated that the bill would cause more than 30 million people to lose insurance. The Graham-Cassidy proposal would let states opt out of the requirement that insurers charge sick and healthy people the same rates, causing a furor among advocacy groups that say it could make health insurance unaffordable for those with pre-existing conditions.

"FBI chief promises to disclose any attempt to stall Russia probe WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The FBIâ€™s acting director promised on Thursday to tell the Senate Intelligence Committee of any effort to interfere with the Federal Bureau of Investigationâ€™s probe into links between Russia and the 2016 Trump presidential campaign. â€œI absolutely do,â€ acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, who leads the agency following President Donald Trumpâ€™s abrupt firing of former director James Comey on Tuesday, told the committee, which is also investigating alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign.

"Democrats dig in, delay against Dodd-Frank overhaul WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives opposed to Republican legislation that would repeal major sections of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law on Tuesday made multiple efforts to delay the bill. The House Financial Services Committee was due to consider Representative Jeb Hensarlingâ€™s sweeping bill to rework the 2010 law. In addition to eliminating large portions of Dodd-Frank - enacted in the wake of the global financial crisis - it would put new handcuffs on regulators charged with writing and enforcing its rules. The partisan maneuvering to slow work on the bill demonstrated how divided the two parties are regarding rules for the financial sector, casting doubt on Congressâ€™s ability to revisit them significantly despite Republican President Donald Trumpâ€™s vow to â€œdo a numberâ€ on existing regulations. First, Democrats ordered a vote on whether the committee even wanted to actually consider the bill. That amendment passed with support from only the Republican majority. Then, Democrats ordered that all 589 pages of the law be read out loud by the committee clerk. The reading of legislative language is almost always waived by committee members when considering a bill. After about 3-1/2 hours of the bill being read to a largely empty committee room, Democrats agreed to shelve that request and proceed to the amendments they wanted to offer. Democrats had drawn up roughly 140 amendments they wanted to offer to change the bill, according to a House aide. But that number is expected to shrink as the two parties work out a path forward. Hensarling announced on Tuesday that despite earlier plans to vote on amendments to the bill throughout the day, no votes would be held on the bill until Wednesday morning at the earliest. The procedural obstacles were all aimed at a bill that is not expected to actually become law, as the sweeping rewrite of Dodd-Frank is not expected to garner enough support in the Senate, which the Republicans hold by a slim majority.  But it is expected to pass the Republican-led House, and the skirmish over it was a clear indication of how much Democrats are willing to dig in on measures that would make life easier for the financial sector. â€œThis is one of the worst bills Iâ€™ve seen in my time in Congress,â€ said Representative Maxine Waters, the committeeâ€™s top Democrat, as the committee began debate on the measure. â€œThe bill is rotten to the core, and simply carries water for Trump and his buddies on Wall Street.â€ Hensarlingâ€™s bill would allow large banks to avoid most Dodd-Frank rules if they agree to establish a 10 percent capital ratio, and also scraps several powers given to regulators after the financial crisis to more closely scrutinize some of the nationâ€™s largest institutions. It also makes several changes to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, severely limiting its power and giving Congress and the White House more direct control over its operations and funding.

"Comey's friend says he's turning over Comey's Trump memos to FBI: MSNBC WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A friend of former FBI Director James Comey said on Tuesday he is turning over to the FBI any memos he has of Comeyâ€™s conversations with President Donald Trump, MSNBC reported. It said the friend, Columbia Law School professor Daniel Richman, confirmed to NBC News that â€œheâ€™s now turning over any Comey memos that he has in his possession to the FBI.â€ Comey, fired by Trump last month, said in congressional testimony last week that he gave a memo describing his conversations with Trump to a close friend and told him to share its contents with a reporter. MSNBC said Richman also said Robert Mueller, special counsel leading an inquiry into possible links between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russia, has been in touch with the Senate Judiciary Committee to discuss how the panel can get access to the memos. The MSNBC report came as U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions appeared on Capitol Hill for a high-profile public session with lawmakers to answer questions about his dealings with Russian officials. Sessions is the most senior member of Trumpâ€™s administration caught up in the controversy over whether associates of the president colluded with Russia to help Trump win the election. Attention in Washington has turned to whether Trump might seek to fire Mueller, the former FBI director named last month by the Justice Department to head the federal probe into the Russia issue. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who would be responsible for carrying out any such dismissal, told a different congressional panel on Tuesday he would not fire Mueller without good cause and he had seen no such cause. Sessions appeared before the intelligence committee just five days after Comey, whom Trump fired on May 9, told the panel Trump ousted him to undermine the agencyâ€™s investigation of the Russia matter.

" Obama Pens STUNNING Response To Trumpâ€™s Cold-Blooded Move On DACA â€“ Trump Fans Should Be Ashamed Trump is working his tail off to undo absolutely everything President Obama ever did, because the black man who once occupied the White House apparently hated all of America and everyone in it far more than His Royal Orangeness, and that includes ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. That program protects undocumented immigrants from deportation if they were brought into the country as children.That was one of Obama s more controversial executive orders, with Republicans all up and down the line calling it a gross overreach of executive power. But Trump s plan is more insidious than a belief that he s righting the wrongs of the previous administration. He promised to remove 11 million undocumented immigrants from the country, who (in his mind) are here because Obama and the Democrats favor open borders, and by golly, he s going to accomplish that even if it hurts innocent people.Like those protected by DACA.So Obama wrote an absolutely beautiful response to Trump s cold-blooded fuckery on Facebook, naming every single thing wrong with Trump s move, including that it is politically motivated and morally questionable. He also pointed out what should be obvious, but apparently isn t, to anyone who believes the GOP s lies: Kicking [these immigrants] out won t lower the unemployment rate, or lighten anyone s taxes, or raise anybody s wages. For eons, the GOP has been sending the message that undocumented immigrants are just one huge burden on us that we can t sustain. White, working-class Americans took that to mean that undocumented immigrants are one of the main reasons they re losing their jobs and can t make any headway in this economy.It s a matter of basic decency, according to Obama. He knows as well as the rest of us that Trump has no decency to him, because if he did, he wouldn t do this, let alone shirk his own responsibility for it by shifting it over to Congress: Ultimately, this is about basic decency. This is about whether we are a people who kick hopeful young strivers out of America, or whether we treat them the way we d want our own kids to be treated. It s about who we are as a people   and who we want to be. The ending of it is a subtle jab at those who claim strict adherence to the Constitution s letters, but not its spirit, like all those allegedly  Constitutional  Republicans and conservatives who blasted Obama over DACA, and now stand with the Racist-in-Chief on this.

"Republican tax bill retains U.S. electric vehicle tax credit WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A compromise Republican tax bill released late Friday does not eliminate a $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit as Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives had previously proposed. The measure follows the lead of the Senate version approved last month that did not eliminate the credit. Killing the credit could have hurt automakers like General Motors Co (GM.N), Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and Nissan Motor Co (7201.T). Consumers under current law are eligible for a $7,500 tax credit to defray the cost of plug-in electric vehicles. The electric vehicle tax credit starts to phase out after a manufacturer sells 200,000 plug-in vehicles. After an automaker hits that point, the $7,500 tax credit is still available for at least three more months before phasing out.  Consumers are currently allowed to take the credit on vehicles until the manufacturer hits 200,000 plug-in vehicles sold. Electric vehicles have expensive batteries that make them pricier than gasoline-powered vehicles. The Electric Drive Transportation Association said in a statement late Friday it was pleased the credit would remain in law. â€œThe credit supports innovation and job creation while helping drivers access advanced vehicle technology,â€ the group said. More than 50 automakers and other companies and groups released a letter earlier this week urging Congress to retain the credit, including Ford Motor Co (F.N), BMW AG (BMWG.DE), GM, Uber Technologies Inc. Former President Barack Obama repeatedly proposed hiking the tax credit for electric vehicles to $10,000 and converting it to a point-of-sale rebate, but Congress did not approve the measure. Automakers face mandates from California and a dozen other states to produce a rising number of zero-emission vehicles and have said the credits are essential to meeting requirements. ",Real

"Lawsuit against Trump over foreign payments expands NEW YORK (Reuters) - A nonprofit watchdog expanded a lawsuit accusing U.S. President Donald Trump of violating the Constitution by letting his hotels and restaurants accept payments from foreign governments. The amended complaint filed on Tuesday in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan adds a restaurant trade group, whose members include nationally known chefs Tom Colicchio and Alice Waters, and a hotel events booker in Washington, D.C. as plaintiffs. It is intended to address concern over whether the watchdog, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, was itself harmed by Trump and had standing to sue at all. Trump is expected to respond by April 21, and had said the original lawsuit filed on Jan. 23 had no merit. Spokesmen for the U.S. Department of Justice did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday. The amended complaint said Trump violates the Constitutionâ€™s â€œemolumentsâ€ clause, which bars him from accepting various gifts from foreign governments without congressional approval, by maintaining ownership over his business empire despite ceding day-to-day control to his sons, Eric and Donald Jr. It said members of Restaurant Opportunities Centers (ROC) United Inc, which represents more than 200 restaurants and nearly 25,000 workers, have improperly lost business, wages and tips to Trumpâ€™s competing businesses. Jill Phaneuf, the other new plaintiff, works for a hospitality company that books events in hotels near Washingtonâ€™s â€œEmbassy Row,â€ which house foreign diplomats, and claimed that Trump is costing her commissions. The complaint said such plaintiffs are injured when foreign governments try to â€œcurry favorâ€ with Trump by favoring his businesses. It said this has even occurred since Trump took office, when China granted him trademark rights after he pledged to honor the â€œOne Chinaâ€ policy of his White House predecessors. ""When asked why defendant changed his position on the One China policy, and whether he had gotten something in exchange from China, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer answered: 'The President always gets something,'"" the complaint said. (here) U.S. District Judge Ronnie Abrams, an appointee of former Democratic President Barack Obama, oversees the litigation. The lawsuit seeks to â€œuphold one of the most basic aspects of the rule of law: no one, including the president, is above the law,â€ Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California at Irvineâ€™s law school and one of the plaintiffsâ€™ lawyers, said in a statement.

" WATCH: Don Lemon CRUSHES Trump Supporter For Claiming That Mike Pence Loves Gay People Trump mouthpiece Kayleigh McEnany just made the most asinine claim about Mike Pence and got roundly hammered for it on CNN.Unless you ve been hiding in cave over the last decade, you know that Mike Pence is a hateful bigot who thinks gay people are an abomination. He not only tried to legalize discrimination against gay people in Indiana, he supports inhumane conversion therapy and took money away from HIV funding to fund that right-wing bullshit  cure  instead.Angela Rye kicked off the panel discussion about Mike Pence being booed by the audience prior to a performance of  Hamilton  on Broadway. The cast of the play then delivered a thoughtful message to Pence expressing their hope that he learned something.Rye explained that the lead actor is a gay man who is HIV-positive and could not imagine what he felt when the biggest anti-gay bigot in the country walked in to watch the performance.McEnany responded by attacking the  Hollywood elite, the media elite, the political elite  and whined about people calling Trump a racist and homophobe even though Trump is a racist and homophobe.Lemon finally shut her up by getting the discussion back on point, asking her to imagine how gay people feel when Mike Pence discriminates against them. He then pointed out that the  Hamilton  cast was expressing their hope that Pence will treat the LGBT community like human beings. Can you imagine how that feels when Mike Pence, who has rallied and railed against gay people, and tried to shoot down and block gay legislation?  Lemon asked.  He s saying,  I m giving you a chance to give me a chance,  he added in reference to the star of  Hamilton. But then McEnany opened her mouth her spewed a monster lie. Mike Pence loves all people,  she claimed, drawing an emphatic rebuke from Lemon, who is also openly gay. Mike Pence does not love gay people. His record shows that he does not love gay people. Here s the video via YouTube.Make no mistake, Mike Pence is an anti-gay bigot and he will stop at nothing to try and roll back gay rights to the point where they have no rights left.

"U.S. corporate tax cut goal in doubt, Trump dines with senators WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin cast doubt on President Donald Trumpâ€™s chances of cutting the corporate tax rate to 15 percent, while Trump met with six senators including three Democrats who set clear conditions for future cooperation with him on taxes. The president is cranking up a publicity campaign to build public support for his general goals of lower and simpler taxes, but no detailed tax plan has been completed or proposed by the White House or the Republicans in control of Congress. Even after months of discussion within the party, basic questions are unanswered, such as whether tax cuts should be designed so they donâ€™t add to the federal deficit and debt, and how deeply business and individual rates should be cut. Mnuchin told a conference in New York hosted by CNBC on Tuesday that Trump, as the president has said for months, would like to cut the corporate income tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent. Then Mnuchin, a top tax adviser to Trump, said, â€œI donâ€™t know if weâ€™ll be able to achieve that, given the budget issues, but weâ€™re going to get this down to a very competitive level.â€ Later in the day, Trump held a dinner at the White House with the six senators. Reflecting his new willingness to engage with the political opposition, three Democrats attended the dinner. In contrast, Republican leaders in Congress have been trying for most of the year to write a tax bill while ignoring the Democrats. Also attending were Vice President Mike Pence, White House economic adviser Gary Cohn and Mnuchin. Pennsylvania Republican Senator Pat Toomey, one of the attendees, said on a conference call later that Trump talked about competitive business taxes, ending taxation of U.S. corporationsâ€™ foreign profits, and a middle-class tax cut. After the meal, Trump took some of the senators on a tour of the West Wing. Later, the Democrats expressed an openness to working with Trump on taxes, but stressed certain conditions. West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin said in a statement he would continue to fight for a simpler tax code, but â€œwe must do this without adding to our staggering debtâ€. North Dakota Democrat Heidi Heitkamp said in a statement the dinner was a â€œgood discussionâ€ and that she told the president any tax package must support working families and farmers. Overhauling the tax code was one of Trumpâ€™s main campaign promises in 2016, but he has made little progress toward it. After nearly eight months in office, he has yet to win passage in Congress of any major domestic policy legislation. Besides Manchin and Heitkamp, others at the dinner were Indiana Democrat Joe Donnelly and three Republicans: Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch and fellow tax panel Republicans John Thune and Toomey. Donnelly said in a statement, â€œTax reform should include measures to support companies that invest in our workers and penalize companies that ship American jobs to foreign countries.â€ A major concern on tax cuts is the federal budget deficit. It would balloon if tax rates were cut too deeply without providing offsetting federal spending reductions and closure of tax loopholes, both politically difficult tasks. White House budget chief Mick Mulvaney told Fox News on Tuesday that he hoped tax reform would not be revenue neutral, suggesting he is not overly concerned about the deficit and the national debt, now about $20 trillion. â€œWe need as big and as a dramatic tax reduction and tax reform as we possibly can get,â€ Mulvaney said. Mnuchin declined to say what business tax rate was achievable. He said he was â€œincredibly hopefulâ€ a tax plan could be enacted this year, adding it could be retroactive to January. Asked if Trump would hold out for a 15 percent corporate rate, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said: â€œThe president is prepared to push for as low of a rate as we can get.â€ Republican Paul Ryan, the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, said last week that â€œthe numbers are hardâ€ to make Trumpâ€™s 15-percent corporate tax rate target work. Ryan set his own goal at around 22.5 percent. Trumpâ€™s legislative affairs director, Marc Short, said at a Christian Science Monitor event, â€œWe think that whatâ€™s best for the American people is a 15-percent corporate rate right now.â€ Financial markets rallied after Trumpâ€™s election victory last November in anticipation of rapid tax cuts, especially for corporations, but those expectations have faded. â€œThe likelihood of passing sweeping corporate reform has diminished,â€ Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Wealth Management, said in a research note. Democrats, who generally oppose tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, will have negotiating clout in Congress in early December to resist tax changes they oppose, also potentially including a corporate rate cut. Trump may visit as many as 13 states to sell his planned tax cuts to voters in coming weeks, the White House said. The U.S. Senate will begin tax overhaul hearings this week. Republican Senator John Kennedy, a budget committee member, told Reuters he wanted tax plans â€œwith specificityâ€ and expressed frustration at the slow pace of the tax debate. â€œNo more platitudes. Letâ€™s see some meat on the bone,â€ Kennedy said. â€œAnd Iâ€™m tired of screwing around. ... The American people are tired of screwing around.â€ ",Real
" Federal Judge Tells Anti-Vaxxers To Go F*ck Themselves, Upholds Strict California Vaccination Law Anti-vaccination advocates were hoping they could continue exposing the general public to diseases that had been largely wiped out by vaccines, but a judge dashed that hope on Friday.In 2015, California dealt with a months long measles epidemic stemming from a person who was visiting Disneyland.According to the Los Angeles Times:131 California residents were believed to have been infected with measles during the outbreak that began at Disneyland, as well as at least 26 people who resided in seven other states, Canada or Mexico, after visiting the Anaheim theme park or catching the virus from someone who went there.The outbreak created a health crisis in the state, especially since some schools have immunization rates around 50 percent or lower according to state epidemiologist, Dr. Gil Chavez.Measles had been eradicated in America by 2000, but because some crackpot researcher in England published a terribly flawed study claiming that vaccines cause autism, a claim that has been thoroughly debunked by scientists, many paranoid and ignorant parents have decided not to vaccinate their kids, which is why 7 in 10 Californians who got the measles were unvaccinated. If we had higher levels of immunity in the community, this outbreak would not have happened,  Chavez said.And the risk of exposure was not just in California schools. Public health officials contacted thousands of Californians in 12 counties potentially exposed to measles, leading to warnings in airports, malls, schools, clinics and hospitals,  the Times reported.  In one hospital alone, a single person with measles exposed 14 pregnant women and 98 infants, including 44 in the neonatal intensive care unit. After California quelled the epidemic, state lawmakers went to work to make sure such an epidemic never happens again. To that effort, they took particular aim at personal and religious exemptions that anti-vaxxers have taken advantage of over the years to decline to vaccinate their kids. They soon passed a law requiring all children to be vaccinated. The only exemption allowed is if the child has a medical condition, such as a suppressed immune system, that would prevent them from getting the vaccine.But anti-vaxxers threw a hissy fit and filed a lawsuit last month in order to prevent lawmakers from protecting the public health and safety.And U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw ruled that they can go f*ck themselves and laughed them out of court because state lawmakers have a  long history of requiring children to be vaccinated as a condition to school enrollment  and  plaintiffs have not made a showing that they are entitled to the extraordinary remedy of a preliminary injunction. In short, the law will go into effect this year and now every child will be required to be vaccinated if they want to be enrolled.And that s a good thing.We cannot let irresponsible parents put the public health at risk just because they disagree with science. Measles is one of the most contagious diseases known to man and is even more contagious and deadlier than Ebola.Sixteen years ago this country had wiped out the disease within our shores, and all that effort went to waste because some parents listen more to celebrities like Jim Carrey and Jenny McCarthy than they do to doctors and scientists. That needs to change, and this California law is the first step.Featured image via CBS News",Fake
"Trump asks for probe into imports of foreign-made steel: officials WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday will sign a directive asking for a speedy probe into whether imports of foreign-made steel are hurting U.S. national security, two administration officials said on Wednesday. Trump is to sign the memorandum related to section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 at a White House event that is expected to include leaders of some U.S. steel companies. The law allows the president to impose restrictions on imports for reasons of national security. There are national security implications, one of the officials said, from imports of steel alloys that are used in products such as the armor plating of ships and require a lot of expertise to create and produce. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross launched the probe on Wednesday night. Trumpâ€™s directive will ask Ross to conduct it â€œwith all deliberate speed and deliver the results to the president with his recommendations,â€ a second official said.

" REPORT: Team Trump Tried To Bribe Networks For More Pro-Trump Coverage (DETAILS) It s no secret that there is no love lost between Donald Trump and the media. However, a new report regarding how his son-in-law Jared Kushner tried to manipulate the press into covering the Trump campaign in a better light is downright disturbing. According to The Hill, Kushner offered better access to the campaign in exchange for more pro-Trump news pieces.The first attempt to control messaging in this way was done by asking Sinclair Broadcasting   an outfit that owns local stations nationwide   to have anchors refrain from commenting on Trump s rallies, statements, and interviews, and just air footage of the rallies and interviews instead, and in the most flattering light possible. Kushner revealed this tactic while speaking to New York City business people. The trade off was that the Trump team would be more cooperative with friendly networks.In fairness, it seems that Sinclair Broadcasting s efforts here were noble, and likely if it were anyone but the highly manipulative Team Trump, it would likely be fine because no other campaign would ever make such demands. Sinclair Vice President Scott Livingston said of the deal: Our promise was to give all candidates an opportunity to voice their position share their position with our viewers. Certainly we presented an opportunity so that Mr. Trump could clearly state his position on the key issues. Our commitment to our viewers is to go beyond podium, beyond the rhetoric. We re all about tracking the truth and telling the truth and that s typically missing in most political coverage. Okay, fair enough, but it seems Livingston underestimated Trump and his campaign. They have no respect for journalists, do not tolerate voices that are critical of Trump, and they refuse to cooperate with media outlets that are not explicitly pro-Trump. This attitude is never more apparent than what happened when Trump s team tried to get CNN to have more Trump supporters included in their famously heated political panel debates. This was a request from Jared Kushner as well, and when CNN s Jeff Zucker shot that request down, the Trump people became increasingly difficult for the network to deal with.CNN s refusal to kowtow to his request seemed to irritate Kushner so much that he couldn t stop talking about the network at the New York business meeting. One person who was in the room said of Kushner s CNN remarks: He kept going on and on about it. It was around this time when Trump started calling CNN the  Clinton News Network  and trashing them on Twitter.This does not bode well for the free press and the First Amendment in general under a Trump Administration. Clearly, these people want to control the message   and that message better be pro-Trump or else. Likely, Breitbart will be a Trump propaganda arm, and he will, slowly but surely, sow distrust in any press that is not explicitly flattering and supportive of him. He already has a head start, as most of his supporters do not trust anything that isn t said by Trump himself.Welcome to your Banana Republic, America. It s going to be a rough four years.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",Fake
"Republican strategy on healthcare bill in flux ahead of vote WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Senate leaders aim to hold a procedural vote as early as Tuesday to take up legislation to repeal or replace Obamacare, but it remained unclear which version of the bill senators would vote on. President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans campaigned on a pledge to roll back former President Barack Obamaâ€™s signature healthcare law, the 2010 Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Senator John Thune, a member of the Republican leadership, told â€œFox News Sundayâ€ the initial vote was simply a way to open debate on the bill so that senators from both parties could offer amendments. â€œThe first vote, which will occur sometime this week, will be to proceed to the consideration of that legislation and to at least have a debate where we can have an open amendment process,â€ Thune said. The Republican-controlled House in May passed its version of a healthcare bill. Senate Republicans have considered two versions of related legislation but have been unable to reach consensus after estimates showed as many as 22 million fewer Americans would be insured if the proposals became law. A plan to repeal Obamacare without replacing it also ran aground. Republicans control a narrow majority in the Senate, holding 52 of 100 seats. With the Democrats united in opposition to the Republican effort, Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell can only afford to lose the votes of two Republican senators. The fate of any legislation to rewrite Obamacare is uncertain as many Republicans have not yet made clear their positions. â€œIt appears weâ€™ll have a vote on Tuesday but we donâ€™t know whether weâ€™ll be voting on the House bill, the first version of the Senate bill, the second version of the Senate bill,â€ Republican Senator Susan Collins told CBSâ€™ â€œFace the Nationâ€ on Sunday. Collins is a moderate Republican who has objected to prior versions of the Senate bill and also to repealing Obamacare without replacing it. Trump suggested last week that he was fine with letting Obamacare fail, but he then switched course and invited Republican senators to the White House to try to hash out a healthcare deal. The Republican effort has also been complicated by the absence of Republican Senator John McCain, who has been diagnosed with brain cancer and has been in his home state of Arizona weighing treatment options.

"U.S. officials will not label treatment of Rohingya as 'ethnic cleansing' WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. government officials declined on Tuesday to characterize the treatment of Myanmarâ€™s Rohingya Muslims as ethnic cleansing, but listed new measures including targeted sanctions Washington is considering to address the crisis. â€œIâ€™m not in a position ... to characterize it today, but to me this very closely resembles some of the worst kind of atrocities that Iâ€™ve seen during a long career,â€ Mark Storella Deputy Assistant Secretary of State from the Bureau Of Population, Refugees and Migration said at a Senate hearing, when pressed to say whether he viewed the situation as ethnic cleansing. Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims have fled Myanmarâ€™s Rakhine state since security forces responded to Rohingya militantsâ€™ attacks on Aug. 25 by launching a crackdown the United Nations has denounced as ethnic cleansing. Myanmar, also known as Burma, rejects that accusation, insisting action was needed to combat â€œterroristsâ€ who killed civilians. But it has left the world community counting the cost as international organizations and the government of Bangladesh, which has taken in the vast majority of the refugees, race to provide food, water and medical care. Many U.S. lawmakers have clamored for a strong U.S. response to the crisis and criticized government leader Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel peace laureate once hugely popular in Washington, for failing to do more. â€œSheâ€™s an impressive person, but sheâ€™s not taking on the challenge,â€ said Senator Ben Cardin, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Cardin said he considered the treatment of the Rohingya genocide. The State Department said on Monday that Washington is taking steps and considering a range of further actions over Myanmarâ€™s treatment of the Rohingya, including targeted sanctions under its Global Magnitsky law. [L2N1MZ01T] At the foreign relations committee hearing, Patrick Murphy, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian And Pacific Affairs, said broader sanctions were also being considered, but cautioned that doing so could lessen the U.S. governmentâ€™s ability to influence the Myanmar government to change.

" SHAME: Proof Trump Doesnâ€™t Care About Military Veterans Donald Trump has often invoked the U.S. military and treatment of military veterans while he has campaigned as the Republican presidential nominee. But time and time again, when it comes to actions and deeds, Trump s behavior is that of someone who doesn t really care at all.The latest evidence of that comes from reporting on how he behaved while attacking the family of Captain Humayun Khan, the soldier who died protecting his unit in Iraq in 2004. Trump responded to the Khan family s speech during the Democratic Convention by attacking the family, but now we are learning just how ignorant Trump was while he was involved in this smear.New York Magazine s Gabriel Sherman reported on Saturday that when one adviser warned Trump he had just attacked a Gold Star family, the GOP nominee responded  what s that?  The term is commonly used to refer to any family that has lost a loved one in war. The United States has officially recognized these families since 1936.[ ]Sherman also reported that Paul Manafort, who was then Trump s campaign chairman, had to explain what  Gold Star family  meant.Reporting has shown that with Trump, the Republicans have nominated an extreme narcisst, who doesn t understand any more of the wider world than he has to contend with on a day-to-day basis. Trump neither cares nor does he have the curiosity to care, even if the welfare of soldiers is the issue.His staff has been reduced to being a series of sitters for a wealthy baby.Captain Khan s father, Khizr Khan, is still involved in the 2016 election. Within the last week, Mr. Khan was on the campaign trail speaking about and advocating on behalf of the candidate he believes in and who he trusts to defend Muslims, soldiers, and Muslim soldiers: Hillary Clinton.Featured image via Flickr",Fake
"U.S. civil liberties group to challenge Trump's new travel ban WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The American Civil Liberties Union on Friday launched the first legal challenge to President Donald Trumpâ€™s new restrictions on people entering the United States from eight countries. The civil rights group said in a statement that it will seek to amend an existing lawsuit in Maryland federal court that was filed against Trumpâ€™s previous March 6 ban. In a letter filed with U.S. District Court Judge Theodore Chuang, the ACLU said the new proposal announced on Sunday violates the U.S. Constitution as well as federal immigration law. Trumpâ€™s new ban places indefinite restrictions on travel to the United States for citizens from Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Chad and North Korea. Certain government officials from Venezuela will also be barred.   The ACLU will seek an injunction that would block visa and entry restrictions on those affected. Challengers of Trumpâ€™s immigration restrictions have said the bans are aimed at following through on a pledge he made on the campaign trail in 2016 to block Muslims from entering the country. â€œPresident Trumpâ€™s newest travel ban is still a Muslim ban at its core, and it certainly engages in discrimination based on national origin, which is unlawful,â€ said the ACLUâ€™s executive director, Anthony Romero. â€œWeâ€™ll see President Trump in court - again,â€ he added. The new ban, Trumpâ€™s third, could affect tens of thousands of potential immigrants and visitors. Trump has argued that the restrictions fulfill his campaign pledge to tighten immigration and security. â€œThe Department of Justice will continue to vigorously defend the presidentâ€™s inherent authority to keep this country safe,â€ said Justice Department spokesman Ian Prior. The ACLU represents several nonprofit groups, including the International Refugee Assistance Project as well as individuals who say they would be affected by the ban, which goes into effect on Oct. 18. Chuang was one of two district court judges who blocked Trumpâ€™s second travel ban, saying â€œit is likely that its primary purpose remains the effectuation of the proposed Muslim ban.â€ Legal experts say the new ban is likely on more solid footing than the previous bans, in part because it was implemented following a detailed review by federal agencies. Trumpâ€™s first travel ban aimed at seven Muslim-majority countries, issued soon after he took office in January, was blocked by courts following chaotic scenes at airports. The second ban, targeting six countries, was blocked by lower courts and partially revived by the Supreme Court in June. ",Real

"Trump's push to cut federal jobs has modest impact, mostly in defense WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trumpâ€™s campaign to shrink the â€œbloated federal bureaucracyâ€ so far has made a small dent in the federal  workforce, and that largely because of a decline in civilian defense jobs. Days after his Jan. 20 inauguration, Trump ordered a hiring freeze later replaced with an order for federal agencies to cut staff immediately, and in March he proposed a 2018 budget that sought to shift $54 billion to the military from other departments. However, federal civilian jobs declined around 6,000 in the first nine months of this year, or just 0.3 percent of 2.1 million such jobs tracked by the Office of Personnel Management, according to Reuters calculations based on the latest OPM data published in late October. The White House Office of Management and Budget declined to comment on the overall drop in federal employment or the mix of job gains and losses across agencies. The Office issued in April the order for agencies to start near-term staffing cuts and to submit plans for longer-term reductions by September. Trump has not detailed how much â€œfatâ€ he aims to cut, but spoke of â€œbillions and billions of dollarsâ€ of government waste and his aim to shrink the â€œbloated federal bureaucracyâ€ while preparing his budget proposals in March. Independent watchdogs agree the federal government could be made more efficient, with Congressâ€™s Government Accountability Office estimating in April that overlap and duplication lead to â€œtens of billionsâ€ of dollars in unnecessary spending.  Before Trump, Democrats Barack Obama and Bill Clinton and Republican George W. Bush have all spearheaded various efforts to streamline government bureaucracy. David Lewis, a political science professor at Vanderbilt University, said this yearâ€™s numbers showed that Trumpâ€™s executive orders had limited power to reshape the federal bureaucracy. Ultimately, the Congress controlled the budgets and had the biggest sway over agenciesâ€™ staffing, said Lewis, whose research has largely focused on executive branch politics and public administration. The White House has said agenciesâ€™ longer-term workforce reduction plans will serve to develop Trumpâ€™s 2019 budget proposal.  The overall decline in federal staffing this year is largely due to a roughly 9,500 drop at the Department of Defense to about 731,000, a 1.3 percent decline, even though Trumpâ€™s budget proposal envisaged small increases between 2016 and 2018 in employment measured by hours worked. Pentagon spokesman Dave Eastburn said hiring was slow during the White House-ordered freeze, but exemptions allowed recruitment for mission-critical positions and military readiness was never affected. He described the decrease in staffing this year as â€œwell within historical norms.â€ In fact, the number of active-duty service personnel, which was exempt from the hiring freeze, grew by about 7,000 in the 12 months through September, according to Defense Department data.  Still, cuts in the civilian staff could push more work onto relatively expensive contractors and military officers, potentially raising costs over time, said Scott Amey, general counsel at the Project on Government Oversight, a non-partisan watchdog group.    â€œIf weâ€™re just cutting jobs to cut jobs then mistakes are likely to be made,â€ Amey said after reviewing Reutersâ€™ calculations of OPM data.  Mallory Barg Bulman, a researcher at the Partnership for Public Service, a non-partisan nonprofit, said targeting the number of jobs in general was not the best way of improving how the bureaucracy works. â€œA hiring freeze is not the answer to making the government more effective,â€ said Barg Bulman. Instead, agencies should invest more in training to boost productivity, she said.  The OPM figures, which exclude the postal service and some smaller independent agencies, showed the declines were in part offset by staffing gains - totaling about 9,000 - at the homeland security and veterans affairs departments. Much of the gains were in divisions that control immigration and in medical care for former soldiers, areas Trump has identified as priorities. The Department of Veterans Affairs did not respond to a request for comment. A spokeswoman at the Department of Homeland Security said staffing increases owed to revised recruitment strategies as well as temporary hiring for hurricane relief efforts. Some staffing ups and downs at agencies are part of long-standing budget issues or seasonal factors. The Treasury Department lost staff largely due to budget cuts ordered by Congress in past years for its tax collection service, while the departments of interior and agriculture saw increases due to seasonal hiring.

"U.S. Supreme Court to hear Ohio's bid to revive voter purge policy (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to hear Ohioâ€™s appeal of a lower court ruling that blocked the Republican-led stateâ€™s policy of purging people from voter-registration lists if they do not regularly cast ballots because it violated federal law. Civil liberties advocates who challenged Ohioâ€™s policy said it illegally erased voters from registration rolls and unlawfully disenfranchised minorities and poor people who tend to back Democratic candidates. The justices will review a U.S. appeals court ruling that Ohioâ€™s policy ran afoul of a 1993 law called the National Voter Registration Act, which Congress passed to make it easier for Americans to register to vote. A Reuters analysis last year found that in Ohioâ€™s three largest counties, which include Cleveland, Cincinnati and Columbus, voters were struck from the rolls in Democratic-leaning neighborhoods at roughly twice the rate as in Republican neighborhoods under the policy. Ohio officials argued that canceling registrations for voters deemed inactive for six years helped keep voting rolls current and accurate, clearing out those who have moved away or died. In September 2016, ahead of the U.S. presidential election, the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati ruled that the policy was unlawful. Democrats have accused Republicans of taking steps at the state level, including laws imposing new requirements on voters such as presenting certain types of government-issued identification, intended to suppress the vote of minorities, the poor and others who generally favor Democratic candidates. The American Civil Liberties Union last year sued Ohio Republican Secretary of State Jon Husted, arguing that the state was violating the National Voter Registration Act, which prohibits states from striking registered voters â€œby reason of the personâ€™s failure to vote.â€ The 6th Circuit agreed. Under Ohioâ€™s policy, if registered voters miss voting for two years, they are sent registration confirmation notices. If they do not respond and do not vote over the following four years, they are removed from the rolls. Husted has said Ohioâ€™s policy has been in place since the 1990s under both Republican and Democratic secretaries of state. The suit said the policy led to the removal of tens of thousands of people from the voter rolls in 2015, including one of the lead plaintiffs, Larry Harmon, a software engineer and U.S. Navy veteran who was blocked from voting in a state marijuana initiative in 2015.  Republican Donald Trump won Ohio in last Novemberâ€™s presidential election. The National Voter Registration Act, dubbed the â€œMotor-Voterâ€ law when it was enacted, required states to permit registration by mail or when eligible people apply for or renew a driverâ€™s license, or visiting certain government agencies or military recruiting offices.

" Trump Just Got Dealt A STINGING Blow From His Own Son-In-Lawâ€™s Newspaper The New York Observer, which Ivanka Trump s husband, Jared Kushner, owns, has made its presidential endorsement. Or, more accurately, its presidential non-endorsement. After endorsing Trump during the primaries, his own son-in-law s paper has decided it s not endorsing anyone at all.The Observer s editor-in-chief, Ken Kurson, simply said: Observer is not going to make an endorsement in the general. Oh, ouch. That just hurts, at least for Trump. We re ecstatic. The Observer can t endorse Hillary or they d probably all get fired, and the same thing could happen if they endorsed a third-party candidate. But it seems that they can t, in good conscience, endorse their owner s father-in-law.Wow.Trump hasn t been able to get very many newspaper endorsements in the general   in fact, he s only gotten six endorsements in all, and they re all from small papers with the exception of Sheldon Adelson s Las Vegas Review-Journal. That s it. That s all. Hundreds of newspapers in the country, and Trump garners a whole six endorsements.Compare that to Hillary s dozens of newspaper endorsements, which include conservative papers like the Arizona Republic, which had never endorsed a Democratic candidate in its 126-year history, and the Dallas Morning News, which hadn t endorsed a Democrat for more than 75 years. Other papers with strong histories of endorsing Republicans likewise broke with tradition to endorse Hillary.You know your candidate just sucks horrifically when his own son-in-law s paper can t bring itself to endorse him. Amusingly, the Observer has actually had issues with its coverage of Trump because of Kushner s relationship, with Kurson saying in 2015: If we run something pro-Trump we will automatically be accused of carrying water for him (on account of the relationship to our publisher). If we run something anti-Trump, we will be accused of trying to curry favor with our peers in journalism or worse, intentionally being only a little hard on him so that later we can love him up and point to the earlier softball as proof that we re fair. So they re in an impossible position, really, but their refusal to endorse Trump at all is a blow to his standing as a candidate.Featured image by Brian Blanco via Getty Images",Fake

NBC Nightly News (@NBCNightlyNews) June 3, 2017Trump decided the minutes after a possible terror incident in London would be a good time to retweet fear-mongering speculation from the right-wing conspiracy site Drudge Report. His action may have done one of two equally disgusting things: He either amplified the terror being spread by a terror attack (thereby doing the work of the terrorist) or he spread misinformation and rumors thereby needlessly scaring people because of his eagerness to exploit a tragedy.Either way, people were appalled.But Trump wasn t done.Rather than wait for the facts to come in, Trump immediately seized on the moment to renew his push for a Muslim ban in the United States. British officials hadn t even confirmed the number of dead and wounded, and Trump was busy using the tragedy to promote his own bigoted policies an ocean away. It would take him three tweets before he got around to expressing concern for the victims.Trump has been increasingly relying on unreliable right-wing conspiracy sites to get his information. As president, he regularly receives extremely detailed information about world events from experts in the intelligence community, but his animosity towards the officials in the FBI and CIA, and his general dislike of reading makes him often ignore the valuable intel. Instead, he chooses to get his information from Drudge, Fox News, and InfoWars. The right-wing media sites are notoriously unscrupulous. InfoWars, for example, endorsed the theory that the Sandy Hook school shooting was staged by Obama as a pretext to taking people s guns. Drudge routinely gets facts wrong in its rush to promote fear and intolerance in its extremely right-wing audience.Two hours later, Trump finally deleted the Drudge Report tweet   which puts him in an awkward position because it technically violates federal law to do so.

Cohenâ€™s name surfaced in a dossier, compiled by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, that reported Cohen played an important role in liaison with the Russian government and secretly met with Kremlin officials in Prague in August 2016. The Steele dossier, Cohen said in his statement, is â€œriddled with falsehoods and intentionally salacious allegations.â€ â€œI have never in my life been to Prague or to anywhere in the Czech Republic,â€ he said. Current and former U.S. intelligence officials have said that while they cannot verify all the details in the Steele dossier, neither have they debunked it entirely. It was not immediately clear why Cohenâ€™s meeting with Senate investigators was postponed. â€œThe committee has chosen to postpone todayâ€™s interview and we will come back for a voluntary interview whenever we can to meet with them,â€ Ryan told reporters. â€œMr. Cohen will continue to co-operate.â€ Cohen said in his statement that the collusion charges are meant to discredit Trumpâ€™s presidency. â€œIâ€™m also certain that there are some in this country who do not care about the facts, but simply want to politicize this issue, choosing to presume guilt - rather than presuming innocence - so as to discredit our lawfully elected president in the public eye,â€ he said.

" MSNBC Producer Reminds Idiot Trump That â€˜Morning Joeâ€™sâ€™ Ratings Are Setting Record Highs (TWEET) Donald Trump spent his week on Twitter blasting Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough, hosts of MSNBC s Morning Joe. Rather than focus on something important, like the fact that his party is trying to kick millions of people off of their health care and leave them to die, he would rather spout off about the host of a cable news show  bleeding badly from a facelift.

"Justice Department antitrust nominee Makan Delrahim's hearing delayed WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The confirmation testimony expected on Wednesday for Makan Delrahim, who was nominated to head U.S. Justice Departmentâ€™s Antitrust Division, has been delayed by missing paperwork, Senator Charles Grassley said in a hearing. Delrahim is a member of President Donald Trumpâ€™s transition team. â€œIâ€™m disappointed we couldnâ€™t go forward with Mr. Delrahimâ€™s hearing this morning. We are still waiting on one piece of paperwork, which we understood weâ€™d have by now. And I imagine that will be transmitted to us within another day or two, and we look forward to including him on our next hearing,â€ Grassley told the Senate Judiciary Committee.  Grassley, an Iowa Republican who chairs the committee, did not say which paperwork was missing. Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, called the missing document a â€œsnag.â€ Delrahim was expected to move to the Justice Department after finishing up in the White House counselâ€™s office, where he  worked to steer Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch through the Senate confirmation process. The Senate must vote to confirm Delrahim. As the proposed chief of the Antitrust Division, Delrahim would review corporate mergers at a time when many investors and corporate executives are anticipating a more relaxed view of deal-making. Former President Barack Obamaâ€™s administration faced a large number of megadeals in what one enforcer called a â€œmerger tsunamiâ€ and blocked many of them. Before going to work at the White House after Trumpâ€™s inauguration in January, Delrahim was a lobbyist with the law firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, LLP. One client in 2016 was health insurer Anthem Inc, which this year lost a court fight with the Justice Department over whether it would be allowed to merge with Cigna. Anthem has appealed the loss.

"Interior Secretary to make proposal on Bears Ears monument in test for protected land WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is due to make a recommendation to the White House on Saturday on whether to rescind or resize Utahâ€™s Bears Ears monument, setting the tone for the administrationâ€™s broader study of which lands protected by past presidents should be reopened to development. The 1.35 million-acre monument, created by former president Barack Obama at the end of his term and named after its iconic twin buttes, is the first of 27 national monuments that will be evaluated by the Department of the Interior after President Donald Trump ordered the review in April. The deadline for Zinkeâ€™s recommendation on Bears Ears is June 10, though an Interior Department official did not say when the recommendation would be made public. Trump had argued that previous administrations â€œabusedâ€ their right to designate national monuments under the U.S. Antiquities Act of 1906, and put millions of acres of land, mainly in western states, off limits to drilling, mining, logging and ranching without adequate input from locals. Conservation groups, meanwhile, have called Trumpâ€™s effort to alter existing national monuments illegal and irresponsible, and have vowed to challenge him in court. â€œWhatever comes out of these recommendations will give us an insight into how this administration takes its responsibilities to protect public lands and uphold conservation mandates,â€ said Nada Culver, senior counsel of the Wilderness Society, an environmental advocacy group.     The review taps into a heated national debate over Washingtonâ€™s role in Americaâ€™s wildest spaces: environmentalists and tribal groups support federal oversight, but many state political leaders, conservatives, and industry groups say the lands should be generating money for business, creating jobs, or yielding revenue for education and other public services. Bears Ears was created after years of lobbying by a coalition of five tribes, who say the area is sacred. Republicans, like Senator Orin Hatch of Utah, have argued, however, that Obamaâ€™s designation of the Bears Ears monument had weakened education funding in the state through its School and Institutional Trust Lands system - which delivers revenues from land development to schools. While the land encompassed by the Bears Ears monument is not believed to contain huge amounts of coal, oil or gas, several other monuments on Zinkeâ€™s review list do - making the Bears Ears decision important symbolically to industry groups. â€œWho is to say that, in the future, a president couldnâ€™t just put a whole basin under monument designation,â€ said Kathleen Sgamma, president of the Western Energy Alliance, representing oil and gas companies.

" Mexicoâ€™s Former First Lady Rips Trump Visit, Says Mexicans â€˜Repudiateâ€™ His Hate Mexico s former first lady, Margarita Zavala, wasted no time slamming Donald Trump, who is set to make an appearance in Mexico, visiting current president Enrique Pe a Nieto, who invited the Republican nominee.From her twitter, Zavala denounced Trump on behalf of the Mexican people:Sr. @realDonaldTrump aunque lo hayan invitado, sepa que no es bienvenido. Los mexicanos tenemos dignidad y repudiamos su discurso de odio.  Margarita Zavala (@Mzavalagc) August 31, 2016Translation: Sr. Donald Trump: although they have invited, know that you are not welcome. Mexicans have their dignity and repudiate hate speech.Needless to say, Zavala s tweet was met with praise from Mexican citizens and other Spanish speaking individuals, who like Zavala, were offended by Trump s never ending barrage of outrageous lies about their country.Zavala, whose husband is former Mexican President Felipe Calderon, served in the country s Congress in the 1990s and is reported to be running for President herself in 2018. She was the country s first lady from 2006 to 2012. Calderon made headlines earlier this year when he told CNBC that Mexico would not  pay a single cent for such a stupid wall. Zavala is right   Mexico denounces hate speech, and they especially denounce Donald Trump, whose favorability in the country is a whopping 2 percent. If Trump thinks the world doesn t respect us now, he should see how much we ll be hated if he wins.With President Pe a Nieto s approval rating at 23 percent, Mexico could very well find themselves electing their first female president, Margarita Zavala, in 2018. Imagine if the United States and Mexico, two close allies, both had strong female leaders guiding the conversation, breaking up the good old boys club, and strengthening Latin-American relations.With Mexico up in arms about Trump s visit (and rightfully so), the message has been sent: our allies south of the border appear to be With Her. And they appear to be with Zavala, at least on this issue.Featured image via Gage Skidmore",Fake
" Meet The Black Man Donald Trump Tried To Murder (VIDEO) Donald Trump has often campaigned as the self-described  law and order  candidate in the 2016 presidential election. But one of the men Trump tried to persecute is speaking out against the reality TV star.As recently as last week, Trump argued that the Central Park Five should be behind bars. The men were five young black men who were railroaded by the criminal justice system and falsely accused of raping a white woman (known as the Central Park Jogger). Eventually, after they were imprisoned, another man was connected to the crime via DNA evidence and the Five were released. They received a court judgment and were rewarded monetary damages for their unjust incarceration.Trump took out a full-page ad during the trial, calling for the boys  execution. Now, one of those men, Yusef Salaam, is speaking out about Trump and his incitement and what Salaam describes as  calling basically for us to be murdered. Yusef Salaam said Donald Trump s infamous full-page ad calling for the deaths of the Central Park Five would in an earlier era been the impetus that sparked  mob justice    in a new ad against Trump. They had our names, our phone numbers and addresses in the papers so what would ve happened? Somebody from the darkest places of society would ve come to our homes, kicked in our doors, and drug us from our homes and hung us from the trees in Central Park. That would ve been the type of mob justice that they were seeking. Trump still refuses to accept that these men are innocent, part of a troubling pattern from the Republican nominee in a blas  attitude towards black concerns and safety. Asked during the debates about police brutality against blacks and the protests of the Black Lives Matter movement, Trump has instead gone at length about  stop and frisk  and inner city crime. It is his go-to position and rhetoric when speaking about black people.Featured image via screen capture",Fake
" How Hate Groups Raised MILLIONS Disguised As Charities Several white supremacist hate groups have been able to exploit federal law and raised millions while disguising themselves as charities, according to a new report. Espousing a hate message that advocates for a whites-only America where minorities are removed from the country, these groups are not subtle about what they believe in. Yet they were still able to pretend to be charitable groups in the eyes of the government.The federal government has allowed four groups at the forefront of the white nationalist movement to register as charities and raise more than $7.8 million in tax-deductible donations over the past decade, according to an Associated Press review.Already emboldened by Donald Trump s popularity, group leaders say they hope the president-elect s victory helps them raise even more money and gives them a larger platform for spreading their ideology.With benevolent-sounding names such as the National Policy Institute and New Century Foundation, the tax-exempt groups present themselves as educational organizations and use donors  money to pay for websites, books and conferences to further their ideology. The money also has personally compensated leaders of the four groups.The IRS actually has the power to exclude hate groups from being awarded a non-profit designation, but some experts believe that recent complaints about the IRS scrutinizing conservative scam groups that registered as non-profits has scared off the agency. They also don t have the full resources necessary to police these sort of groups.Even worse, the incoming Trump administration has coddled these groups, inviting them to cover his campaign and the 2016 Republican National Convention. In all likelihood rooting out hate groups using the tax code to give tax breaks to racist funders is unlikely to be a major target for the Trump team. It will fall to bureaucrats in the IRS and outside investigations to expose these groups.Featured image via Wikimedia Commons",Fake

"U.S. lawyer defending travel ban grilled in court over Trump's tweets WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Federal appeals court judges on Friday asked about President Donald Trumpâ€™s sharing of anti-Muslim videos on his Twitter account, as they grilled a U.S. government lawyer about the legality of the presidentâ€™s latest travel ban. Judge Pamela Harris asked government lawyer Hashim Mooppan about Trumpâ€™s Nov. 29 online sharing of three anti-Muslim videos posted on Twitter by a far-right British party leader. Lawyers say that and earlier statements by Trump prove the policy is aimed at blocking the entry of Muslims, rather than the presidentâ€™s stated goal of preserving national security. â€œEven with deference, construing them in the light most favorable to the president, itâ€™s a little tricky to find the national security rationale in thoseâ€ Twitter posts, Harris said at the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals hearing in Richmond, Virginia, monitored by Reuters over audio feed. This week, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed the ban to take effect while litigation over its ultimate validity unfolds. Certain categories of people from Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen are barred from entering the United States, as well as people from North Korea and some government officials from Venezuela. The Republican president has said the ban is needed to protect the United States from terrorism. However, Judge James A. Wynn Jr. said Trump â€œtweets the very thingâ€ that his opponents claim is behind the ban. â€œWhat do we do with that?â€ On Wednesday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held a hearing over the ban, in a separate case brought by the state of Hawaii. A lawyer from the American Civil Liberties Union argued against the ban on behalf of several refugee groups, civil rights groups and individual American Muslims who say they are harmed by the ban. Mooppan argued on behalf of the government that the latest travel ban should be considered on its own merits, and separately from statements Trump has made on social media or elsewhere that could be construed to be anti-Muslim. He noted that the latest iteration of the ban came after a review by government agencies. â€œI need you to explain to me how a review process by subordinate executive branch officials is an independent act that can cure the taint from presidential statements,â€ Harris, an Obama appointee, said to Mooppan. Judge Barbara Milano Keenan, also an Obama appointee, asked why nationality was more relevant than other factors such as gender in considering the potential for terrorist acts. â€œCould he ban the entry of all men until evidence showed further that men are not the ordinary and customary perpetrators of terrorist activity?â€ Keenan asked. â€œIf 99 percent of terrorist acts are committed by men, arenâ€™t we really protecting this country if we just keep out the men?â€ Mooppan pointed to previous bans on the entry of Iranians by Democratic President Jimmy Carter and Cubans by Republican President Ronald Reagan as examples of presidents who barred people based on nationality. ACLU attorney Cecillia Wang faced tough questioning from Judge Paul Niemeyer, who asked when it would be justified for courts to question the national security determinations of the president. â€œAll foreign policy is a black box and it should be,â€ said Niemeyer, a George H.W. Bush appointee.  Trump issued his first travel ban in January. The order, which targeted several Muslim-majority countries, caused chaos at airports and was blocked by courts. He revised it in March, and that ban expired in September after a long court fight. It was replaced with the current version. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to ultimately decide the issue in the coming months. ",Real
" WATCH Trumpâ€™s Former Campaign Manager TOTALLY Forget That John Kerry Lost In 2004 Corey Lewandowski is still beating the Trump drum on CNN, including defending Trump s campaign shakeup this late in the game. There s just one tiny problem   he s doing so by comparing this shakeup to John Kerry s shakeup in 2004 and we all remember how that election turned out.The comments came just after now-former campaign chair Paul Manafort resigned from the campaign, which just strengthened all the talk that Trump is past the point of no return and cannot win this election no matter what he does. Lewandowski tried to counter that by saying: This campaign is not the first campaign to make staff changes. If you look at John Kerry s campaign, when he was running, he was making changes as late as Labor Day, and don t forget we re still in August  No, I understand, but the change in 2004 that John Kerry made helped him actually do significantly better than what he was doing. So? Kerry still lost. There is no getting around that fact. Kerry lost by about 3 million votes and 35 electoral votes. Yes, it was a close election, but really? He still lost and we still got four more years of George W. Bush. It s hard to imagine that anybody of Lewandowski s age and background doesn t see that.This is the kind of ignorance that s pervading Trump s campaign. Things have gotten so pathetically bad that there are people saying the polls don t matter because his social media followings are huge and attendance at his rallies is huge. Tens of millions don t attend his rallies, and it should be patently obvious that his social media following is very heavily biased.Lewandowski is a perfect Trump proxy with his head full of cotton.

" National Security Expert Warns Of The DIRE Dangers Of Trumpâ€™s Plan For Intel Community (VIDEO) For the first time in our lives, we are entering an era where we have elected a president who is downright dangerous. Donald Trump is petty, childish, ignorant, thin-skinned, vengeful, and a wannabe dictator   and he will soon be the most powerful man on the planet. Well, it seems that there are some highly respected people who realize this, and hopefully they can keep us all safe during this travesty of a presidency. One such person is national security expert and former intelligence officer Malcolm Nance.Nance sat down for a chat with MSNBC s Joy Reid on Saturday morning, and he did not mince words when it came to the dangers of Trump, and what he believes the incoming president-elect strongman has in store for America s top spy agencies. First, Reid began: Let s just get to Donald Trump s refusal to be able to accept, Malcolm, the conclusions of the intelligence community even when the head of the intelligence agencies are sitting in front of him telling him this happened. Why in your view will he not just accept it? Nance s reply was most ominous: I think because, when Donald Trump made his statement on July 27th of last year where he asked for Russia to hack Hillary Clinton and release her e-mails, at that point he went from being an unwitting useful idiot to Russia to actually believing that they were working in his favor. To admit that now, in the face of all the evidence, he would believe that this would delegitimize his presidency and he will fight to the end to not allow this to become a narrative. Of course he will. It s a telltale trait of people with authoritarian tendencies to be unable to have their legitimacy questioned for any reason whatsoever. Trump will stop at nothing to prevent the media from talking about this. Hell, given his constant attacks on them, he may even try to use the power of the presidency to prohibit there being any sort of check on him for any reason, but especially when it comes to Russia.Nance continued: I suspect that in two weeks he s going to attempt to cover this all up and even gut the intelligence community. He is pushing this nation to a constitutional crisis of unprecedented magnitude, because no one has ever worked in the interests of a hostile nation and supporting, to a certain extent, a hostile intelligence service. Nance is exactly right. Trump is dangerous. He is looking to serve his own interests, not those of the United States of America. Should he continue along this path   and we know that he will   the people in a position of power to do something about him better damn well do it fast, lest he shred the Constitution and destroy American democracy forever.Watch the video below, via Raw Story:Featured image via video screen capture",Fake
"U.S. Senator Hatch says 25 percent corporate rate a challenge in tax reform WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Congressional Republicans and the Trump administration face a challenge reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 25 percent, let alone to the 15 percent rate sought by President Donald Trump, the Senateâ€™s top tax law writer said on Monday. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, in an interview with Reuters, said that getting the corporate rate to 25 percent from 35 percent would bring a sea change to the U.S. economy. But he added that bipartisan cooperation may be necessary for tax reform to succeed. The Utah Republicanâ€™s comments mark the first time that a member of the â€œBig Sixâ€ principals involved in high-level tax reform talks has described a 25 percent corporate tax rate as a challenge. In recent weeks, officials have described a target range of 20 to 25 percent. He described Trumpâ€™s 15 percent proposal as â€œvery unlikelyâ€. â€œIn fact, it would be kind of miraculous if we could get it down to 25 percent or less. Iâ€™d like to get it down to around 20 percent. Iâ€™d love to get it at 15 percent if we could,â€ Hatch said. â€œBut I think the odds are, weâ€™re going to be lucky to get it down at all.â€ Twenty percent is the corporate tax rate proposed by Republicans in the House of Representatives.  He said success could hinge on getting Democratic support for tax legislation, saying he has had discussions on a bipartisan path forward with his committeeâ€™s top Democrat, Senator Ron Wyden. He called on Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer to â€œopen the doorâ€ to cross-party cooperation. Hatch and other Big Six negotiators from the Senate, White House, Treasury and House issued a joint statement last week, emphasizing their commitment to sweeping tax law changes. On Monday, a White House aide said Trump would travel to promote tax reform in states including Michigan and Wisconsin. The White House hopes the House will vote on tax legislation in October and the Senate in November. â€œIf we could get the corporate tax rate down to, letâ€™s say, a maximum of 25 percent, it would be a sea change for this country. It would be great,â€ Hatch said. â€œIn this current Congress, itâ€™s almost impossible to change because the Democrats have just about slowed everything down to such a point that we canâ€™t hardly move on anything. But Iâ€™m going to try to break through and get this done.â€ ",Real

Jackson actually blames Trump s campaign staff rather than the Great Orange Racist himself for the abysmal polling results when it comes to African American voters. Jackson says: Mr. Trump really does have a sincere, passionate interest in black outreach, but his campaign staff has dropped the ball. I have been saying repeatedly that you cannot go into a black community in the ninth hour of a campaign and ask them to vote for a GOP candidate. The party has done a piss-poor job of courting the black vote over 50 years. So you have to have more vested interest in time and in your financial effort for the whole campaign, not just in the last 100 days. Well, Mr. Jackson, you got one thing right here: The GOP HAS done a piss poor job of reaching out to black voters for decades. There s a reason for that, though: the party is full of racists. That s just the truth, but being a black Republican yourself, I suppose that you either refuse to see or choose to overlook that fact. Just a couple of examples, to remind you.

"Trump's son, close associates to appear before Senate WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trumpâ€™s son Donald Trump Jr., son-in-law Jared Kushner and former campaign manager Paul Manafort have been asked to appear before U.S. Senate committees next week to answer questions about the campaignâ€™s alleged connections to Russia, officials said on Wednesday. The three men are the closest associates of the president to be called to speak to lawmakers involved in probing Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign. Trump, who came into office in January, has been dogged by allegations that his campaign officials were connected to Russia, which U.S. intelligence agencies have accused of interfering in last yearâ€™s election.  Trump has denied any collusion.  The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee said on Wednesday that it had called Trumpâ€™s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and  Manafort to testify on July 26 at a hearing. The presidentâ€™s son released emails earlier this month that showed him eagerly agreeing to meet last year with a woman he was told was a Russian government lawyer who might have damaging information about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. The meeting was also attended by Manafort and Kushner, who is now a senior adviser at the White House. Kushner is scheduled to be interviewed by the Senate Intelligence Committee on Monday, July 24, behind closed doors. â€œWorking with and being responsive to the schedules of the committees, we have arranged Mr. Kushnerâ€™s interview with the Senate for July 24,â€ Kushnerâ€™s attorney, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement. â€œHe will continue to cooperate and appreciates the opportunity to assist in putting this matter to rest.â€ A special counsel, Robert Mueller, is also conducting an investigation of Russian meddling in the U.S. election and any collusion between Moscow and Trumpâ€™s campaign.  The issue has overshadowed Trumpâ€™s tenure in office and irritated the president, who told the New York Times on Wednesday that he would not have appointed ally and former Senator Jeff Sessions as attorney general if he had known Sessions would recuse himself from oversight of the Russia probe. â€œSessions should have never recused himself, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job and I would have picked somebody else,â€ Trump said in the interview. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee, said the committeeâ€™s hearing would enable the panel to begin to get testimony under oath. â€œThere has been an enormous amount that has been said publicly but itâ€™s not under oath, which means that people are free to omit matters or lie with relative impunity,â€ Whitehouse told CNN. The Senate Intelligence Committee is conducting one of the main investigations of Russiaâ€™s meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and possible collusion by Trump associates, but the Judiciary committee has been looking into related issues. The public Judiciary hearing on Wednesday will look into rules governing the registration of agents working for foreign governments in the United States and foreign attempts to influence U.S. elections. Chuck Grassley, the committeeâ€™s Republican chairman, has said he wanted to question the Trump associates, but has also raised concerns about why the Obama administration allowed Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer who attended the Trump Tower meeting in June, into the United States.  He also has called before the committee and threatened to subpoena Glenn Simpson, a co-founder of Fusion GPS, a firm that commissioned former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele to dig up opposition research on Trump, when he was a presidential candidate.

"Trump reassures farmers immigration crackdown not aimed at their workers WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said he would seek to keep his tough immigration enforcement policies from harming the U.S. farm industry and its largely immigrant workforce, according to farmers and officials who met with him.     At a roundtable on farm labor at the White House last month, Trump said he did not want to create labor problems for farmers and would look into improving a program that brings in temporary agricultural workers on legal visas.           â€œHe assured us we would have plenty of access to workers,â€ said Zippy Duvall, president of the American Farm Bureau Federation, one of 14 participants at the April 25 meeting with Trump and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue. During the roundtable conversation about agriculture, farmers and representatives of the sector brought up labor and immigration, the details of which have not been previously reported. Some farmers told Trump they often cannot find Americans willing to do the difficult farm jobs, according to interviews with nine of the 14 participants. They said they were worried about stricter immigration enforcement and described frustrations with the H-2A visa program, the one legal way to bring in temporary seasonal agricultural workers. The White House declined to comment on the specifics of the discussion, but described the meeting as â€œvery productive.â€ The U.S. Department of Agriculture did not respond to a request for comment on the April meeting.  About half of U.S. crop workers are in the country illegally and more than two-thirds are foreign born, according to the most recent figures from the U.S. Department of Laborâ€™s National Agriculture Workersâ€™ Survey.  During the roundtable, Luke Brubaker, a dairy farmer from Pennsylvania, described how immigration agents had recently picked up half a dozen chicken catchers working for a poultry transportation company in his county.  The employer tried to replace them with local hires, but within three hours all but one had quit, Brubaker told the gathering at the White House.  Trump said he wanted to help and asked Secretary Perdue to look into the issues and come back with recommendations, according to the accounts. While other issues such as trade, infrastructure and technology were also discussed,  participants were more positive after the meeting about the conversation on foreign labor â€œthan about anything else we talked about,â€Â Â said Bill Northey, a farmer and Iowaâ€™s secretary of agriculture. Tom Demaline, president of Willoway Nurseries in Ohio, said he told the president about his struggles with the H-2A guestworker program, which he has used for 18 years. He told Trump the program works in concept, but not in practice. â€œI brought up the bureaucracy and red tape,â€ he said. â€œIf the guys show up a week or two late, it puts crops in jeopardy. You are on pins and needles all year to make sure you get the workers and do everything right.â€ While use of the program has steadily increased over the past decade, it still accounts for only about 10 percent of the estimated 1.3 million farmworkers in the country, according to government data. In 2016, the government granted 134,000 H-2A visas Employers who import workers with H-2A visas must provide free transportation to and from the United States as well as housing and food for workers once they arrive. Wage minimums are set by the government and are often higher than farmers are used to paying.  Steve Scaroni, whose company Fresh Harvest brings in thousands of foreign H-2A workers for growers in Californiaâ€™s Central valley, says, however, that he could find work for even more people if he had more places to house them.Â  For a related photo essay click on:  reut.rs/2qdtfnb Trump recently signed another executive order titled â€œBuy American, Hire American,â€ calling for changes to a program granting temporary visas for the tech industry, but not to visas used by farmers and other seasonal businesses, including Trumpâ€™s own resorts. Trump also signed two executive orders, just days after taking office, focused on border security that called for arresting more people in the United States illegally and speeding up deportations. Roundtable participants said that many farmers have worried about the effect of the stepped up enforcement on their workforce, but Trump told them his administration was focused on deporting criminals, not farmworkers. â€œHe has a much better understanding about this than some of the rhetoric we have seen,â€ said meeting attendee Steve Troxler, North Carolinaâ€™s agriculture commissioner and a farmer himself. The farmers at the meeting said they stressed to the president the need for both short-term and permanent workers. They said there should be a program to help long-time farmworkers without criminal records, but who are in the country illegally, to become legal residents.  Last Tuesday, Democrats in the House and Senate said they would introduce a bill to give farmworkers who have worked illegally in the country for two consecutive years a â€œblue cardâ€ to protect them from deportation.  Brubaker, the Pennsylvania farmer, said he liked what he had heard about the bill and hoped it would get the presidentâ€™s support to make it a bipartisan effort.  â€œThe administration has got something started here,â€ he said of the meeting with farm leaders. â€œItâ€™s about time something happens.â€Â   ",Real
"Ex-Twitter worker claims responsibility for Trump's account shutdown SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A German man has come forward as the former Twitter Inc employee who shut down the account of U.S. President Donald Trump for 11 minutes this month on his last day of work at the social network.  The technology news website TechCrunch published an interview on Wednesday with Bahtiyar Duysak, whom it called a 20-something with Turkish roots who was born and raised in Germany. He was a temporary contract worker in San Francisco for Twitter, the website said. Duysak, who had not previously been identified as the person behind the takedown, told TechCrunch that he considered Trumpâ€™s temporary silencing a â€œmistakeâ€ and never thought the account would get deactivated.  It was not a planned act, he said. Rather, he said, the chance to shutter the account fell into his lap near the end of his scheduled final shift, and he decided to take it.  â€œThere are millions of people who would take actions against him if they had the possibility. In my case, it was just random,â€ Duysak said in a video of the interview posted online. He wore a gray sweater emblazoned with the American flag.  Twitter on Wednesday would not confirm whether Duysak was the ex-employee in question or answer other questions. Reuters could not immediately reach Duysak.  BuzzFeed News, citing two anonymous sources, reported separately that Duysak was the ex-employee responsible.  Duysak is a former volunteer security guard at a Muslim community center in California, BuzzFeed reported. Trump has been critical of Muslims, calling during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign for a â€œtotal and complete shutdownâ€ of Muslims entering the United States.  The takedown of Trumpâ€™s account on Nov. 2 sparked concerns among Twitter users over how much power employees have over sensitive accounts and whether abuse of their power could lead to international incidents. Twitter said in a statement on Wednesday: â€œWe have taken a number of steps to keep an incident like this from happening again.â€  Duysak did not shed much light on the incident. Near the end of his last day at the San Francisco-based company, an alert came to him that someone had reported Trumpâ€™s account for an unspecified violation, he said.  Duysak put the wheels in motion to deactivate it, TechCrunch said, although the account did not go offline until hours later. Neither Duysak nor TechCrunch explained the delay.  â€œI didnâ€™t hack anyone. I didnâ€™t do anything which I wasnâ€™t authorized to do,â€ he said. ",Real

"Pentagon assesses readiness for transgender hires: memo WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Defense is assessing its ability to recruit transgender people as soon as 1 July, according to a memo signed by a top Pentagon official and seen by Reuters. The Pentagon ended its ban on openly transgender people serving in the U.S. military last year under Defense Secretary Ash Carter. That repeal lowered one of the last barriers on who could serve in the military and came after a 2011 decision to end the U.S. militaryâ€™s ban on openly gay and lesbian people. A Pentagon spokesperson verified the contents of the memo, but declined further comment on the document.  The memo instructed each military branch to examine their â€œreadiness to begin assessing transgender applicants into military service on July 1, 2017.â€ In the memo, dated 8 May, Defense Secretary Robert Work instructed chiefs of each military branch and service secretaries to submit their reports by 31 May.

" Donald Trumpâ€™s Eating Habits Could Be Dramatically Affecting His Wellbeing And Our Safety We ve all heard the stories of Donald Trump preferring a well-done steak with ketchup and shunning any new delicacies, despite living a lifestyle that offers him all the luxuries one could ever desire, however, it s not just that the President has terrible gastronomical taste, a new memoir suggests that his diet is one of several poor lifestyle choices that could very well shorten his life.According to an excerpt from Let Trump be Trump, an upcoming book by Trump s former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and aide David Bossie, we get to enter the inner circle where the President of the United States having a 2,400-calorie McDonald s dinner is par for the course. Trump s appetite seems to know no bounds when it comes to McDonald s, with a dinner order consisting of two Big Macs, two Filet-O-Fish, and a chocolate malted,  is just one of the claims made in the book. To put that meal in perspective, Trump s dinner contains 3,400 grams of sodium, despite the American Heart Foundation recommending just 1,500 grams per day, plus enough white bread to last most people a week. Remember, this is just one meal, but it only gets worse. On Trump Force One there were four major food groups: McDonald s, Kentucky Fried Chicken, pizza, and Diet Coke,  the authors write about traveling with Trump during the early days of his presidency, but there may be a valid reason for it   Not only is he a fan of manufacturing, Trump is also a renowned germaphobe who allegedly won t eat from a package that has already been opened, which would also explain the plane s cupboards being stacked with Vienna Fingers, potato chips, pretzels, and many packages of Oreos.  Those well-done steaks make a little more sense now, as well. But a little bit of bacteria is probably the least of the President s worries. This is a 71-year-old man who gets next to no exercise (it s hard to include his golf when he barely even walks while playing), gets very little sleep, and is constantly throwing tantrums, so add in that diet and you have the perfect recipe for a heart attack. The diet alone, especially the snacks, is almost an open-invite for diabetes, too.What makes this frightening for the rest of us is that this is a man who is currently responsible for a nuclear standoff with North Korea, as well as dealing with rapidly warming oceans and an ever-increasing tax bill. If he has this lack of concern for his own wellbeing, then what does it say of his risk-assessment abilities?Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",Fake

"Senate goes 'nuclear,' ends Democrats' blockade of Trump court pick WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senate Republicans on Thursday crushed a Democratic blockade of President Donald Trumpâ€™s U.S. Supreme Court nominee in a fierce partisan brawl, approving a rule change dubbed the â€œnuclear optionâ€ to allow for conservative judge Neil Gorsuchâ€™s confirmation by Friday. With ideological control of the countryâ€™s highest court at stake, the Republican-led Senate voted 52-48 along party lines to change its long-standing rules in order to prohibit a procedural tactic called a filibuster against Supreme Court nominees. That came after Republicans failed by a 55-45 tally to muster the 60-vote super-majority needed to end the Democratic filibuster that had sought to deny Gorsuch confirmation to the lifetime post. The Senateâ€™s action cleared the way to confirm Gorsuch by simple majority on Friday, with a final vote expected by late morning. Republicans control the Senate 52-48. The rule change was called the â€œnuclear optionâ€ because it was considered an extreme break with Senate tradition. Trump had encouraged Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to â€œgo nuclear.â€ Confirmation of Gorsuch would represent Trumpâ€™s first major victory since taking office on Jan. 20, after setbacks on healthcare legislation and the blocking of his order that sought to ban travelers from several Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. Senate confirmation of Gorsuch, a Colorado-based federal appeals could judge, would restore the nine-seat courtâ€™s 5-4 conservative majority, enable Trump to leave an indelible mark on Americaâ€™s highest judicial body and fulfill a top campaign promise by the Republican president. Gorsuch, 49, could be expected to serve for decades. â€œThis will be the first and last partisan filibuster of the Supreme Court,â€ McConnell said on the Senate floor, accusing Democrats of trying to inflict political damage on Trump and to keep more conservatives from joining the high court. â€œIn 20 or 30 or 40 years, we will sadly point to today as a turning point in the history of the Senate and the Supreme Court, a day when we irrevocably moved further away from the principles our founders intended for these institutions: principles of bipartisanship, moderation and consensus,â€ Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor. Schumer ridiculed McConnellâ€™s contention that the Democratic action was unprecedented. He noted that the Republican-led Senate refused last year to consider Democratic former President Barack Obamaâ€™s nomination of appellate judge Merrick Garland for the same seat that Trump selected Gorsuch to fill. With three of the courtâ€™s justices 78 or older, Trump told reporters he hoped to appoint as many as four Supreme Court justices, a move likely to make it overwhelmingly conservative. â€œIn fact, under a certain scenario there could even be more than that,â€ Trump said aboard Air Force One en route to a meeting with Chinaâ€™s president in Florida, adding that the Senate rule change would not alter how he picks court nominees. A conservative-majority court is more likely to support broad gun rights, an expansive view of religious liberty, abortion regulations and Republican-backed voting restrictions, while opposing curbs on political spending. The court also is likely to tackle transgender rights and union funding in coming years. A 60-vote threshold giving the minority party power to hold up the majority party has forced the Senate over the decades to try to achieve bipartisanship in legislation and presidential appointments. In the final procedural vote that paved the way for  confirmation, three Democratic senators up for re-election in 2018 in states won by Trump last year - Indianaâ€™s Joe Donnelly, West Virginiaâ€™s Joe Manchin and North Dakotaâ€™s Heidi Heitkamp - broke with their party and voted with Republicans to bring about a confirmation vote, although they opposed the rule change. A fourth Democrat, Michael Bennet, who represents Gorsuchâ€™s home state of Colorado, voted with Republicans on Thursdayâ€™s first procedural vote to bring debate to a close. But he stuck with fellow Democrats in opposing the final vote to end the filibuster, the one that succeeded following the rule change. Republicans have called Gorsuch superbly qualified and one of the nationâ€™s most distinguished appellate judges. Democrats accused him of being so conservative as to be outside the judicial mainstream, favoring corporate interests over ordinary Americans in legal opinions, and displaying insufficient independence from Trump. What Republicans did to Obamaâ€™s nominee Garland was worse than a filibuster, Schumer said. Schumer said Republicans denied â€œthe constitutional prerogative of a president with 11 months left in his term.â€ â€œThe nuclear option was used by Senator McConnell when he stopped Merrick Garland,â€ Democratic Senator Richard Durbin said  on the Senate floor. â€œWhat we face today is the fallout.â€ McConnell blamed the escalation of fights over judicial nominees on the Democrats and their opposition starting three decades ago to nominees made by Republican former Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. Experts said eliminating the filibuster for Supreme Court appointments could make it more likely that presidents, with little incentive to choose centrist justices who could attract support from the other party, will pick ideologically extreme nominees in the future. Ending the filibuster also would make it easier for future Supreme Court nominees to be confirmed when the president and Senate leadership belong to the same party. The filibuster in one form or another dates back to the 19th century but assumed its current form in the 1970s.  While Democrats opposed the rule change and accused Republicans of a power grab, it was their party that first resorted to the nuclear option when they controlled the Senate in 2013. In the face of Republican filibusters of Obama appointments, they barred filibusters for executive branch nominees and federal judges aside from Supreme Court justices but still allowed it for Supreme Court nominees and legislation. The Republican-backed rule change maintains the ability to filibuster legislation. ",Real

Kneeling during the national anthem is a protest against racial injustice, and so far, it has been working. Attention has been brought to the issue. But Trump wants owners to start firing players who kneel or force them to stand, which would likely see a bunch of lawsuits filed against the NFL.Refusing to stand during the national anthem is protected as free speech and expression by the Constitution. It would be like forcing kids to stand and say the Pledge of Allegiance in school, which is what Trump will probably do next after he gets humiliated by the NFL.The NFL can do that by making sure Colin Kaepernick gets signed by a team. And every NFL player should kneel during the anthem in solidarity with their fellow teammates. Their teammates are under attack by Donald Trump now. It s time to kneel together, not just to protest racism, but to protest him as well. Because Trump is the biggest racist of them all.Featured Image: David Becker / Stringer via Getty",Fake
"U.S. Attorney General defends Trump on NFL protests at free-speech talk WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Tuesday denounced football players who have protested racism by kneeling or locking arms during the playing of the national anthem before games, saying that even though their speech is protected, they should be condemned for showing disrespect to the country. Speaking to an audience at Georgetown Law School, Sessions said athletes who chose to protest during the national anthem were making a â€œbig mistakeâ€ with an action that â€œweakens the commitment we have to this nation.â€ Sessions was at Georgetown to deliver an address about free speech on college campuses. Earlier, U.S. President Donald Trump called on the National Football League to ban players from kneeling in protest while the anthem is played. â€œThe players arenâ€™t subject to any prosecution, but if they take a provocative act, they can expect to be condemned, and the president has the right to condemn them, and I would condemn their actions,â€ he said. Sessions is the latest member of the Trump administration to jump into the fray over national anthem protests by National Football League teams. Trump has been fueling debate on the issue since Friday, when he spoke at a rally and said that any protesting player was a â€œson of a bitchâ€ who should be â€œfired.â€ He has since kept up the pressure through a series of Twitter messages. But his comments have touched off a series of protests by NFL players, coaches and some owners at football games. The comments may play well with Trumpâ€™s conservative base at a time when the Republican president is grappling with North Koreaâ€™s nuclear threats, a humanitarian crisis in hurricane-struck Puerto Rico, an investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 election and a healthcare struggle in Congress.  Sessions made his remarks about the NFL protests following a speech he gave on free speech, in which he said the Justice Department is going to start taking greater steps to protect the rights of speakers on college campuses whom he fears are being censored by student protesters. When asked during a question and answer session afterwards if he was concerned that President Trump was condemning players for exercising their free speech rights, Sessions said that â€œthe president has free speech rights too.â€ ",Real
"Senator Grassley expresses reservations on two Trump judge nominees WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican chairman of the U.S. Senate committee that handles judicial nominations on Tuesday raised concerns about two of President Donald Trumpâ€™s picks for lower court positions, citing controversial statements each has made. Senator Chuck Grassley, who chairs the influential judiciary committee, in comments first reported by CNN cast doubt on whether the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate will vote to confirm the two nominees. Grassley told CNN the White House should â€œreconsiderâ€ the nomination of Jeff Mateer for a district judgeship in Texas and â€œshould not proceedâ€ on the nomination of Brett Talley for a district court vacancy in Alabama.  â€œChairman Grassley has been concerned about statements made by nominees Mateer and Talley, and heâ€™s conveyed those concerns to the White House,â€ say Taylor Foy, a Grassley spokesman.  Grassley did not specify what statements he was referring to. But Talley was reported by online magazine Slate to have posted online sympathetic comments about the early history of white supremacist group the Ku Klux Klan, often known as the KKK. He also failed to disclose that his wife works in the White House Counselâ€™s office, which overseas judicial nominations. Mateer has run into trouble over speeches he made in 2015. In one, he referred to transgender children as being part of â€œSatanâ€™s plans,â€ CNN reported. Talleyâ€™s nomination has already been approved by the committee, but Foy said the statements that troubled Grassley only became public after that vote on Nov 9. No action has been taken on Mateerâ€™s nomination, and the Senate has not scheduled a vote on Talley. Trump has made significant progress in filling vacancies on the federal courts with conservative judges. So far the Senate has confirmed 16 of his nominees to district and appeals courts as well as his appointee to the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch. A White House spokesman did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment. ",Real

" Noam Chomsky Makes ONE Last Request Of Obama, Trump Is PISSED (VIDEO) As many of us are slowly (and sadly) coming to terms with the fact that President Barack Obama has almost completed his final term in the White House, some are making final requests of America s much-loved President.One of the people who still think Obama can save America from Trump is retired MIT linguistics professor Noam Chomsky, who recently posted a plea to Obama to save undocumented immigrants from the incoming Trump administration. In a video message, Chomsky said: President Obama, to his credit, has issued personal pardons in deserving cases, but he should go far beyond. Chomsky was referring to Obama s actions on December 19th, when he pardoned 78 people and gave 153 prisoners shorter sentences   all of which were non-violent, low-level drug offenders. During his presidency, Obama has pardoned a staggering 1,000 individuals   but Chomsky urged the Commander in Chief to go further due to the looming threat of Trump. Chomsky said: He should proceed to what is, in fact, an urgent necessity, to grant a general pardon to 11 million people who are living and working [in America], productive citizens  threatened with deportation by the incoming administration. If Obama pardoned all those people, Trump s promise to deport 2-3 million undocumented immigrants would go out the window. And despite Trump s flip-flopping on his immigration policies, Chomsky isn t banking on the President-elect being sympathetic or understanding in the long run. Bashing Trump s mass deportation scheme, Chomsky continued: This would be a horrible humanitarian tragedy. And moral outrage can be averted by a general pardon for immigration infractions which the President could issue. Peter L. Markowitz, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, has confirmed that this is actually possible. A few months ago, Markowitz stated: President Obama can still act to bring humanity and justice to an immigration system notoriously lacking in both. He can do so by using the power the Constitution grants him   and only him   to pardon individuals for  offenses against the United States.' It s a common assumption that pardons can be used only for criminal offenses, and it s true that they have not been used before for civil immigration violations. However, the Constitution extends the power to all  offenses against the United States,  which can be interpreted more broadly than just criminal offenses. Chomsky said he hoped that Obama would listen to his plea and protect those who were vulnerable and in danger of Trump s divisive rhetoric, and urged his viewers to join him. Chomsky begged: We should join to urge [President Obama] to carry out this necessary step without delay. You can listen to Chomsky make his plea on behalf of undocumented immigrants below:If Obama does this Trump can kiss all of his anti-immigration promises goodbye and will have to suffer the wrath of his racist supporters.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",Fake
"Trump to resume precision munitions deliveries to Saudis: officials WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration notified Congress last week that it soon planned to begin delivering precision-guided munitions to Saudi Arabia under a 2015 weapons deal, congressional officials said on Tuesday. The Senate voted 53 to 47 to narrowly defeat legislation that sought to block portions of a new, separate arms sale to Saudi Arabia, agreed during a visit there by President Donald Trump in May. Arms sales to Riyadh have become increasingly contentious in the U.S. Congress, where some lawmakers object that American weapons have contributed to widespread civilian casualties in a Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen. Republican Trumpâ€™s predecessor Barack Obama, a Democrat,  suspended the planned sale of precision-guided munitions in December because of concerns over civilian casualties in Yemen, where the civil war pits Iran-allied Houthi rebels against the government backed by a Saudi-led Arab coalition. Trump, however, has said he wants to encourage weapons sales as a way to create jobs in the United States.  Senator Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the administration had notified Congress about the start of deliveries on the 2015 sale. He said in a statement that Trumpâ€™s decision was another reason for the Senate to disapprove the new sale. â€œWe need to send a message to both the Trump Administration and the Saudis to work much harder to avoid civilian casualties, expedite humanitarian relief, and push for a peaceful end to the war through a negotiated political settlement,â€ Cardin said. Republicans control both chambers of Congress. A senior congressional aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the notification was received last Thursday. The decision to move ahead with deliveries was first reported by Bloomberg. The 2015 sale included more than 8,000 Laser Guided Bombs for the Royal Saudi Air Force. The package also includes more than 10,000 general purpose bombs, and more than 5,000 tail kits used to inexpensively convert â€œdumbâ€ bombs into laser or GPS-guided weapons. Some of the weapons systems included in the sale were made by Raytheon Co and Boeing Co.  The arms deal announced in May was for $110 billion, with options running as high as $350 billion over 10 years. Tuesdayâ€™s Senate vote, which would block about $500 million of that sale, including precision-guided munitions and other offensive weapons, coincides with Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and other officials in Washington.

"Q&A: What we know about U.S. probes of Russian meddling in 2016 election (Reuters) - Former FBI Director James Comey testified before the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee on June 8 about Russian involvement in the 2016 presidential election. President Donald Trumpâ€™s abrupt firing of Comey on May 9 renewed attention to allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the election to benefit Trump. It also raised questions about the motivations behind Comeyâ€™s dismissal. The following describes what is publicly known and not known about U.S. investigations into meddling and possible collusion between Russia and members of the Trump campaign: How did the investigations begin? Former President Barack Obama ordered U.S. intelligence agencies to assess whether Russia tried to intervene in the  election after a cyber attack on the Democratic National Committee in July 2016 and the publication of thousands of hacked personal emails from Hillary Clintonâ€™s campaign manager in the month before the Nov. 8 election. Obama told intelligence officials to deliver a report on possible foreign interference before he left the White House in January 2017. What did the intelligence agencies find?  The Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency concluded in a report declassified in January that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a campaign not just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system but to affect the outcome. The agencies said Putin and the Russian government had a clear preference for Trump to win the White House. Putinâ€™s  associates hacked information, paid social media â€œtrollsâ€ and backed efforts by Russian government agencies and state-funded media to sway public opinion, the agencies said.  The report stopped short of assessing whether Russia succeeded in swaying the election result. Putin and other Russian officials have repeatedly denied interfering in the U.S. election. How many U.S. investigations are there into Russian election meddling? Comey told the House Intelligence Committee on March 20 that the FBI was investigating Moscowâ€™s role in the election, including possible collusion with Trumpâ€™s campaign. The Justice Department announced on May 17 that it had appointed Robert Mueller, a former FBI director, as special counsel to lead an independent Russia probe. Mueller would, if the evidence merits, work in tandem with the FBI to handle any related criminal prosecutions. In addition, there are multiple committees in the Senate and House of Representatives investigating various aspects of Russian election meddling. What has Trump said about Russiaâ€™s role in the election? He has not taken a clear public position. At a July 2016 news conference, Trump addressed an FBI probe into Clintonâ€™s use of a private email system when she was secretary of state and emails that had possibly been deleted by saying: â€œI will tell you this, Russia: if youâ€™re listening, I hope youâ€™re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.â€ He subsequently dismissed reports, including from U.S. intelligence officials, that Russia had attempted to intervene in the election on his behalf.    The first time Trump said he accepted the findings of the intelligence agencies was at a Jan. 11 news conference ahead of his inauguration. â€œAs far as hacking, I think it was Russia,â€ Trump said, although he added: â€œIt could have been others also.â€ Trump said in May that China may have hacked the emails of Democratic officials to meddle with the election, offering no evidence and countering the view of intelligence officials. Trump has made clear on multiple occasions he believes the Russia investigations have run their course and should be closed. â€œThe Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade end?â€ he wrote on Twitter on May 8. On May 30, Trump tweeted: â€œRussian officials must be laughing at the U.S. & how a lame excuse for why the Dems lost the election has taken over the Fake News.â€ Did the FBI probe continue after Comeyâ€™s dismissal? There is no evidence that the FBI ended or paused its investigation after Comeyâ€™s departure. Andrew McCabe, who is leading the agency as acting director, promised the Senate Intelligence Committee that Comeyâ€™s firing would not affect the investigation and that he will notify the committee of any attempt to delay or derail it.  Trump on June 6 chose former U.S. Justice Department official Christopher Wray, who represented New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in the so-called Bridgegate scandal, to be the next FBI director. Wray will need Senate confirmation. Why was Comey fired? The White House cited a May 9 letter to Trump from Attorney General Jeff Sessions that attached a memo from Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, on â€œRestoring Confidence in the FBIâ€ that recommended Comeyâ€™s dismissal. Rosensteinâ€™s memo said Comey erred in July 2016 by announcing the FBI had been examining Clintonâ€™s use of a private email server and that the case should be closed without prosecution. Rosensteinâ€™s view was that Comeyâ€™s decision to make a public statement broke with longstanding FBI precedent and should have been handled by the then-U.S. attorney general, Loretta Lynch. Trump called Comey a â€œshowboatâ€ and â€œgrandstanderâ€ in an interview with NBC News on May 11, saying that he would have fired Comey regardless of Rosensteinâ€™s recommendation. Was Comeyâ€™s firing related to the FBIâ€™s Russia probe? Comey told the Senate Intelligence Committee he believes his dismissal was directly related to the FBIâ€™s Russia probe. â€œI know I was fired because of something about the way I was conducting the Russia investigation, was in some way putting pressure on him, in some way irritating him, and he decided to fire me because of that,â€ Comey said in his June 8 testimony. Trump asked Comey to end the agencyâ€™s investigation of Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser, and also to make some sort of public statement that he was not personally under investigation in order to clear â€œthe cloudâ€ hanging over his presidency, according Comeyâ€™s testimony. Comey said he found it concerning that Trump would ask him to drop the agencyâ€™s probe of Flynn and declined to state publicly that Trump himself was not under investigation, in part because it would create a â€œduty to correctâ€ if that changed. â€œI need loyalty, I expect loyalty,â€ Trump told Comey at a Jan. 27 dinner, according to Comey. Less than a week before he was fired, Comey told a congressional panel that it made him â€œmildly nauseousâ€ that he may have affected the outcome of the election by publicly re-opening and then re-closing the Clinton email probe days before the election. In an unorthodox move, Great America Alliance, an offshoot of a pro-Trump super PAC devoted to promoting the White House agenda, developed a television ad called â€œShowboatâ€ to air as Comey testified. The ad claims Comey was â€œconsumed with election meddlingâ€ at the expense of fighting terrorism. Has there been any fallout for Trump associates over contacts with Russia before, during or after the election campaign? Flynn was fired in February. The White House said he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about the contacts he had with Russiaâ€™s ambassador to the United States, Sergei Kislyak, before Trump took office. On May 9, federal prosecutors issued grand jury subpoenas seeking business records from people who worked with Flynn when he was a private citizen. On May 10, the Senate Intelligence Committee issued the first subpoena in its Russia investigation, demanding documents from Flynn. He provided the first batch on June 6. Sessions had to recuse himself from involvement in Russia-related probes at the Justice Department because he had not told Congress of his own contacts with Kislyak in 2016. Rosenstein is handling matters related to Russia and it is he who appointed Mueller as special counsel. Is Trump himself under investigation?  In the short letter Trump sent to Comey dismissing him from the FBI, he thanked Comey for informing him on three separate occasions that he was not under investigation. Comey has confirmed that Trump was not personally under investigation at any point before his dismissal from the FBI. Trumpâ€™s personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, said Comeyâ€™s Senate testimony proved the president was not under investigation. Kasowitz denied Trump ever told Comey he needed and expected his loyalty.

"U.S. Senate plans to vote on FCC chairman tenure this week WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday moved to force the Senate to vote later this week on the nomination of Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai to serve another five-year term. The vote on Pai is expected after Democrats plan to harshly criticize him for moving to dismantle Obama-era internet access rules and taking other steps to deregulate U.S. telecommunications rules. McConnell on Tuesday filed a petition to force a vote to end debate on Paiâ€™s nomination. Pai, a former Justice Department, FCC and Capitol Hill staffer, has been moving swiftly to undo many of the regulations adopted by the FCC during the Obama administration since assuming the chairmanship. Pai joined the FCC as a commissioner in March 2012 and was elevated to chairman by President Donald Trump in January. He would be forced to leave at the end of this year if the Senate does not reconfirm him to a new five-year-term In April, Pai proposed overturning the landmark 2015 net neutrality rules. On Tuesday, Pai declined to say when he might ask the FCC to give final approval to the proposal. The rules, which the FCC put in place under Democratic President Barack Obama, prohibit broadband providers from giving or selling access to speedy internet, essentially a â€œfast lane,â€ to certain internet services over others. The rules reclassified internet service providers much like utilities. They were favored by web companies like Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc and others, which said they would guarantee equal access to the internet to all, but opposed by internet service providers, which said they could eventually result in rate regulation, inhibit innovation and make it harder to manage traffic. Internet providers such as AT&T Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and Comcast Corp have argued that the net neutrality rules have made investment in additional capacity less likely. Earlier this year, the FCC voted 2-1 to reverse a 2016 decision that limits the number of television stations some broadcasters can buy. Pai has said he plans to take a new look at the current overall limit on companies owning stations serving no more than 39 percent of U.S. television households and plans a comprehensive review of close to 1,000 pages of media regulations.

" Federal Lawsuit Filed Against Trump Over Financial Disclosure (DETAILS) It looks like Donald Trump can add another case to the list of lawsuits he is facing. An attorney, based in Washington, D.C., has filed suit in federal court alleging that the financial disclosure Trump filed in May 2016 was not even close to accurate.Jeffrey Lovitky filed the lawsuit on March 14. According to Politico, Trump mixed his personal liabilities in with his business liabilities, making it impossible for voters to get a true picture of his potential conflicts of interest. The purpose of these disclosure requirements is to allow members of the public to make informed judgments as to whether candidates for federal office have financial conflicts of interests that may impair their ability to faithfully execute their duties as public servants,  Lovitky explained in the complaint.Lovitky s suit does not accuse Trump of any improprieties, but it does allege that the public has not been given truthful information regarding Trump s many debts due to the lack of clarity in the financial disclosure. If you just look at the statement on its face, all those liabilities are assumed to be personal liabilities, but I just do not think that s the case. I have information that says otherwise,  Lovitky said during an interview with Politico.When Lovitky was asked why he decided to pursue this issue in court, he said that when it comes to Trump, there are  very serious concerns about conflicts of interest. It s mostly the fact that with this president there are very serious concerns about conflicts of interest in this particular administration, and I think it s important that those concerns be addressed thoroughly,  the attorney explained.Lovitky is not seeking damages in the suit and is only asking the court to declare Trump s financial disclosure illegal and order him to file a new one that accurately represents his personal debts. Currently, his next financial closure is not scheduled to be released until May 2018. U.S. District Court Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, who was appointed by Bill Clinton, has been assigned the case.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",Fake
" That Time Donald Trump Said Bill Clinton Was The â€˜Victimâ€™ Of â€˜Unattractive Womenâ€™ Donald Trump is pledging to bring up Bill Clinton s sexual prowess at the second presidential debate. Now that Trump is in the hot seat over a hot mic leak that shows him gleefully admitting to sexual assault, he does what he knows best   deflect.In his half assed apology, Trump took responsibility for his comments, saying that a video from 10 years ago does not reflect the  man  he is now, but said Bill Clinton has done  much worse  and that Hillary Clinton was complacent in bullying and intimidating his victims.So that  the Trump strategy   deflect from his admissions of sexual assault by drumming up sins of Bill Clinton from the 1990s to smear Hillary (because women just love it when the wife is blamed for the husband s misgivings). There s only one teeny tiny problem with that, though.I don t necessarily agree with his victims. His victims are terrible. He is really a victim himself. But he put himself in that position.That s Donald Trump, in August 1998, calling Bill Clinton the real victim. In an interview with Fox News  Neil Cavuto, the billionaire mogul also trashed Monica Lewinsky, Linda Tripp and Lucianne Goldberg as a  really unattractive group  and an  unattractive cast of characters. The transcripts are as followed:The whole thing, it s just so unattractive. Linda Tripp may be one of the most unattractive human beings I ve ever seen not women, human beings. She s just an unattractive person. This [Lucianne] Goldberg person, her agent or whatever she is, is just a terrible woman. You look at Paula Jones, I mean the whole cast of characters. It s like it s from Hell. It s a terrible group of peopleBut Trump wasn t finished insulting their personal appearances:The whole group, it s truly an unattractive cast of characters Linda Tripp, Lucianne Goldberg I mean, this woman I watch her on television, just vomiting. She is so bad. The whole group Paula Jones, Lewinsky it s just a really unattractive group. And I m not just talking about physical, but I am also talking about physical.Trump then went on to say that had Lewinsky and Jones been  supermodels,  they would be  more pleasant to watch. Once again, Trump proves that he does not care about women unless they are visually appealing (which is completely subjective).But now, all of a sudden, he s their unsung hero against  abuser  Bill Clinton and his enabling wife, Hillary?Gee, what changed?If one thinks Trump truly cares about Jones, Lewinsky, Brodderick, Flowers or any of Clinton s alleged victims, they should keep in mind that Trump only cares about their appearances   and their appearances discount them   and he thinks Bill is the real victim.Do not be deceived America.

"Michigan Senator urges Congress to retain electric car tax credit WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Democratic U.S. Senator from Michigan on Wednesday urged his fellow lawmakers to retain a $7,500 tax credit for people who buy electronic vehicles instead of eliminating it as Republicans have proposed. In a letter seen by Reuters, Senator Gary Peters wrote to Senate leaders that â€œa new generation of jobs and families will be supported by electric vehicles. Eliminating important economic incentives for electric vehicles would be a step in the wrong direction.â€ Last week, Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives proposed to eliminate the tax credit, which could hurt automakers such as General Motors Co (GM.N), Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and Nissan Motor Co (7201.T). Republicans in both chambers of Congress backed by U.S. President Donald Trump, also a Republican, are working on separate plans to give the U.S. tax code its biggest overhaul since the 1980s. Republican senators are set to introduce a tax proposal on Thursday. A spokesman for Senator Orrin Hatch, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, did not immediately comment. Critics of the credit say electric vehicle buyers tend to be wealthier than average and do not need subsidies. Automakers have invested billions in electric vehicles and announced plans to shift significant production to plug-in models. Current law allows automakers to use the credit, which phases out after an automaker hits 200,000 plug-in vehicles sold. Electric vehicles have expensive batteries that make them pricier than gasoline-powered vehicles. GM and Tesla may hit the limit for vehicles that can get the tax credit by 2019. Environmental groups and an auto industry trade group oppose the House proposal, which would kick in at the end of this year. GM vowed to fight, saying the credits are â€œan important customer benefit that can help accelerate the acceptance of electric vehicles.â€ Tesla declined to comment. Former President Barack Obama unsuccessfully proposed hiking the tax credit for electric vehicles to $10,000 and converting it to a point-of-sale rebate. Automakers face mandates from California and a dozen other states to produce a rising number of zero-emission vehicles and have said the credits are essential to meeting requirements. ",Real

" Trumpâ€™s â€˜Deportation Forceâ€™ Storms Unarmed Legal Residentâ€™s Home And Shoots Him A Chicago man is in critical condition after the mother of all epic f*ckups by Trump s  Deportation Force.  On Monday morning, ICE agents raided the home of Felix Torres. It is unclear why they would choose to raid the home   not a single person inside is undocumented   but apparently, we are not too concerned about accuracy when we kick down brownish people s doors in Trump s America.At approximately 6:00 a.m., immigration agents entered the home, refusing to tell any of the residents why they were there. According to officials, Torres pulled a gun on the armed men who had forced their way into his home and refused to explain their presence   Torres  family says that s utter hogwash. They didn t say anything. They just came in and pointed pistols in our faces and dragged us out,  Torres  daughter Carmen says, noting that she was not even allowed to dress or grab milk for her one-year-old daughter, who was sleeping when the armed men invaded the home.  It s a lie when they say he was holding a gun. He doesn t even own a gun,  she said.  They shot my dad. They shot him, and I don t know why. At least eight family members were in the house at the time, including numerous children. According to Carmen Torres, the family has lived there for  at least 30 years. We re going to have to talk to CPD to find out if this was a coordinated effort, because if it was in any way, that raises concerns about us as a sanctuary city,  36th Ward Alderman Gilbert Villegas said of the attack.  Is this our future in Chicago with Donald Trump as president? The community s got to be nervous about this, and rightfully so, because you have a right to be in your own home without being intimidated,  Villegas says.  I m conflicted because I haven t got all the details [of the incident] yet, but from the way this has started to play out, it looks like an overstep by an overzealous ICE agent who s just trying to follow Trump s orders. ICE officials say they were not at the home to arrest Torres, though they will nor provide further details. The victim was taken to a nearby hospital where his condition is listed as critical. The shooting is being investigated, though we probably can not expect much in terms of a reasonable resolution to the situation.Featured image via Facebook",Fake
"Departure of communications aide could be first in Trump shake-up WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s communications director is leaving the job, the White House said on Tuesday, as the president considers wider staff changes to try to contain political damage from investigations into Russia and his presidential campaign.  Mike Dubke confirmed reports he had resigned, saying in a statement, â€œIt has been my great honor to serve President Trump and this administration.â€ Dubke, who had been in the job just three months, gave no reason for leaving. Trump, who returned to Washington on Saturday after a nine-day trip to the Middle East and Europe, has been expected to shake up staff to tackle the firestorm over investigations into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and communication between Russia and Trumpâ€™s campaign and transition team.  Trump plans to bring in new aides to the White House, adding experienced political professionals including a former campaign manager, according to administration officials and people close to the president. Dubke, who was joined the White House in March to head the office that runs press and other public relations issues, oversees the White Houseâ€™s message strategy while spokesman Sean Spicer, a more high-profile figure, handles daily media briefings.  The Republican president came home to face more questions on Russia after media reports about communications during and after the campaign between his son-in-law and close adviser, Jared Kushner, and Russiaâ€™s ambassador to Washington. Spicer was asked on Tuesday whether Trump knew about reported efforts by Kushner in December to set up a back channel for communications with Russia. â€œWhat your question assumes is a lot of facts that are not substantiated by anything but anonymous sources that are so far being leaked out,â€ he told a news briefing. Asked about a possible staff shake-up, Spicer said: â€œI think the president is very pleased with his team and he has a robust agenda.â€  Dubke resigned just before Trump left on his foreign trip but will stay on until a transition is concluded, Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, said.        Other potential staff changes could be in the works, according to Axios News, which first reported Dubkeâ€™s departure, including fewer on-camera news briefings by Spicer, the White House press secretary.  Trump also will take more questions directly from the media, Axios reported.  â€œUltimately the best messenger is the president himself,â€ Spicer said on Tuesday. Senior adviser Kellyanne Conway told Fox News the White House will continue to bring in Cabinet secretaries and other top officials to handle news briefings on topics in their patch. Conway also dismissed persistent speculation that Spicer, who has been pilloried on TV comedy shows since Trump took office on Jan. 20, was on his way out.  Controversy over the Russia issue deepened after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey earlier this month, leading to allegations by critics that the president sought to hamper the agencyâ€™s investigation of the matter. Moscow has denied U.S. intelligence agenciesâ€™ conclusion that it meddled in the campaign to try to tilt the election in Trumpâ€™s favor. The president has denied any collusion, repeatedly denouncing the probes by a special counsel at the Justice Department, the FBI and several congressional panels as a Democrat-backed effort to explain Hillary Clintonâ€™s upset defeat in the White House race. Congressional investigations into the Russia issue have expanded to include Trumpâ€™s personal attorney, Michael Cohen, ABC News reported on Tuesday. Cohen confirmed he had been asked to provide information and testimony to investigators in the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate but said he declined because â€œthe request was poorly phrased, overly broad and not capable of being answered,â€ ABC reported.  Cohen did not respond to Reutersâ€™ request to comment. The White House declined to comment, saying Cohen is not an employee of the administration. However, former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn, who resigned after failing to properly disclose his own contacts with Russian officials, told the Senate Intelligence Committee he will begin turning over some documents subpoenaed by the panel, a government source familiar with the matter told Reuters.

" Instead Of Tip, â€˜Christianâ€™ Trump Supporter Leaves Waitress UNBELIEVABLY Sexist Note (IMAGE) Donald Trump is a disease. The symptoms have always been with us. We ve always been a nation that s at least 1/3 completely bigoted a**holes, but this year, Donald Trump has given them permission to fester and spread their hate germs all over the nation.Instead of receiving a tip, a waitress in South Carolina received a note. You re right if you re thinking that never ends well. It didn t. In the note, the obvious Trump supporter told the waitress that she was a disgrace to womankind and a disgrace to her husband   because she worked.Thank you for your excellent service today   you re a good waitress.Here s your tip:The woman s place is in the home. Your place is in the home. It even says so in the Bible. You may think that you re contributing to your household by coming into work, but you re not. While you re in here  working  this is the reason your husband must see another woman on his way home from a long day at his work. Because you should be home taking care of the household duties, you may think what you are doing  working  is right, it is really essentially a disgrace to his manhood and to the American family. So instead of coming to your  job  and looking for handouts to feed your family, how s about going home and cleaning your house and cooking a hot meal for your husband and children, the way your husband and God intended, and help make America great again. Praying for families and our nation.Notice  make America great again?  Obviously, that was a reference to Donald Trump. And obviously, this person has no idea what Christianity is about.The waitress did respond that she  felt mortified, embarrassed, humiliated even. I felt hurt and a bit heartbroken.  She says she s not even married, but she does have a boyfriend who is supportive.Most waitresses don t work because they have nothing better to do. Most people don t work because they have nothing better to do. People, and waitresses are no exception, work because they need money to survive. Most families these days need two incomes, but conservatives don t want to do anything to help them. Instead, they destroy unions, drive down wages and take away benefits. I m not a religious person, but something makes me think Jesus wouldn t approve.h/t and featured image: Patheos |",Fake
"Comey to confirm Trump pressured him on Flynn investigation: CNN WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former FBI Director James Comey plans to confirm reports that President Donald Trump pressured him to drop an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynnâ€™s ties to Russia in congressional testimony, CNN said on Wednesday, citing an unidentified source close to the issue. The Senate Intelligence Committee said on May 19 that Comey, who was fired by Trump 10 days earlier, would testify before the panel publicly at some point after Mondayâ€™s Memorial Day holiday. CNN said the testimony could come as early as next week. Representatives of the committee would not comment on the report. After Comeyâ€™s dismissal, news reports emerged that Trump asked Comey to end the Flynn probe during a February meeting in the Oval Office the day after Flynn was fired for misrepresenting his contacts with the Russian ambassador. The account, first reported by the New York Times, was based on a memo Comey wrote after the meeting.  The Comey memo caused alarm on Capitol Hill and raised questions about whether Trump tried to interfere with a federal investigation. CNN reported that Comey has discussed the parameters of his congressional testimony with Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who has taken over the criminal investigation. It said Comey planned to meet with Mueller, a longtime colleague at the Justice Department and also a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, for a formal interview  after his public testimony. â€œThe Committee welcomes the testimony of former Director Comey, but does not have an announcement to make at this time,â€ said Rebecca Glover, spokeswoman for Republican committee Chairman Richard Burr.

"Moscow in talks with U.S. to create cyber working group: RIA report MOSCOW/LONDON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Moscow and Washington are in talks to create a joint cyber security working group, Russiaâ€™s RIA news agency reported on Thursday, citing Andrey Krutskikh, a special presidential envoy on cyber security. â€œThe talks are underway ... different proposals are being exchanged, nobody denies the necessity of holding the talks and of having such contacts,â€ Krutskikh said, according to RIA. Svetlana Lukash, a Russian official who was at the recent G20 summit of global leaders in Hamburg, said earlier this month that Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump had agreed to discuss cyber security questions, either via the United Nations or as part of a working group.     However, U.S. and European intelligence and security officials told Reuters on Thursday they were not participating in the talks, which they said were confined to mid-level political officials. One of the officials, who like the others spoke on condition of anonymity, said cooperation on cyber security was a â€œpipe dreamâ€ while Russia continues to deny that it hacked last yearâ€™s U.S. presidential election, as three U.S. intelligence agencies concluded publicly in January. On an Air Force One flight home from Europe last weekend, Thomas Bossert, Trumpâ€™s top counterterrorism adviser, told reporters it would be premature to suggest the United States  would be talking to Russia about a possible cyber security â€œpartnership.â€ â€œA partnership suggests that youâ€™ve reached a place where you believe that you have a trusted relationship and youâ€™ve come to some common agreement on ideals and goals and behaviors,â€ he said.  â€œI donâ€™t believe that the United States and Russia have come to that point yet in cyberspace,â€ Bossert said. â€œAnd until we do, we wouldnâ€™t have the conversation about partnership. But we had to have a dialogue, and thatâ€™s where weâ€™ll start.â€ Trump said earlier this month he had discussed the idea of creating such a group with Putin at the Hamburg summit. Senior U.S. Republicans greeted the idea with incredulity, saying Moscow could not be trusted, and Trump later appeared to back away, saying in a post on Twitter: â€œThe fact that President Putin and I discussed a Cyber Security unit doesnâ€™t mean I think it can happen. It canâ€™t.â€ Widespread concern and confusion about the possible cyber working group reflects the Trump administrationâ€™s struggles to articulate a clear approach to international cyber security issues amid inconsistent statements by the president and ongoing personnel changes.  Chris Painter, a widely respected bureaucrat who led the U.S State Departmentâ€™s international engagement on cyber security, is leaving his post at the end of the month amid media reports that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson plans to shutter Painterâ€™s entire office. Painter is scheduled to testify before the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee next week about cyber diplomacy. White House cyber coordinator Rob Joyce told reporters on Wednesday that no final decision had been made about Office of the Coordinator for Cyber Issues, but said the State Department would continue to play a prominent role in developing cyber norms and brokering international agreements. â€œI am confident that Secretary Tillerson is not going to impair cyber security,â€ Joyce said.

" Global Survey HUMILIATES Trump After He Claims World Leaders Loved Everything He Said At United Nations Let s just put it this way, if world leaders really agree with Donald Trump they have a lot of explaining to do in their home countries.Because a massive global survey found that only TWO nations think Trump is doing a good job.During his speech to the United Nations General Assembly this week, Trump voiced his disdain for the United Nations, accusing the organization of being a mismanaged bureaucracy and threatened to pull American financial and military support.Trump also threatened war with North Korea and criticized the Iran nuclear deal while one of his top advisers told climate ministers that Trump is still withdrawing America from the historic Paris climate agreement.Afterwards, Trump took to Twitter to boast about his speech, and claimed that those in attendance agreed with most or all of what he said.A great and important day at the United Nations.Met with leaders of many nations who agree with much (or all) of what I stated in my speech!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 20, 2017In fact, Trump received tepid clapping from the General Assembly, not even close to the kind of thunderous applause President Obama received when he spoke before the international peace-keeping body.And a new study of global surveys reveals that most nations in the world have very little confidence in Trump, which means all the world diplomats who supposedly agree with  much or all  of what Trump said can expect to be replaced. In fact, the only nations who have a favorable view of Trump are Russia and Israel.According to FiveThirtyEight.com, Since Trump took office, confidence in the president has gone down further, on average, than favorability toward the U.S.: Confidence dropped 47 points; U.S. favorability just 13 points Some of the biggest declines have been in countries with whom the U.S. has a collective defense agreement, such as NATO members and Japan, especially when it comes to confidence in the president Mexico, unsurprisingly, also saw a big public opinion drop on both questions. On the other hand, public favorability toward the U.S. has gone up in Russia, and public confidence in the president has gone up in both Israel and Russia since Trump took office. While President Obama enjoyed a public confidence rating of 63 to 73 percent, Trump only has a rating of 27 percent.One of the largest drops came from South Korea, in which only 17 percent have confidence in Trump. 88 percent had confidence in President Obama just two years ago. Clearly, South Koreans are alarmed by the pissing match Trump is having with Kim Jong-Un to discover who is the craziest dictator of them all. Overall, though, Trump has brought a return to George W. Bush-era levels of favorability for the U.S. and the presidency,  FiveThirtyEight concluded.And it turns out that the world disagrees with Trump on most of the issues.Only one nation agreed with Trump s climate change policy. Trump s Mexican border wall was  almost universally disliked.  His vows to withdraw from trade agreements were just as unpopular. Only Turkey approved of withdrawing from the Iran deal. And only three nations approve of Trump s Muslim ban. Basically, most of Trump s supporters come from nations that have committed human rights violations or have oppressive governments.In short, the world representatives who make up the United Nations General Assembly are more likely repulsed by Trump. Tepid clapping is not the definition of overwhelming agreement. Trump thinks that everyone likes him and agrees with him because he is a delusional narcissist.The reality is that Trump has turned America into an international joke and has harmed our reputation around the globe. He is an embarrassment to our country who should be removed from office immediately before he inflicts more damage.He is now the most hated president in history, and that must make George W. Bush very happy. Featured Image: Ron Sachs   Pool/Getty Images",Fake
" Donald Trumpâ€™s â€˜Charityâ€™ Foundation Is About To Be Shut The F**k Down NATIONWIDE Things really aren t looking too great for Donald Trump s charity foundation. With recent developments prohibiting the Trump Foundation from soliciting funds in New York state, it s now looking like a good majority of states may be following suit.The Trump Foundation has also been being looked at by the Attorney General for how it is getting and spending funds, especially after what happen with veterans organizations earlier this year.According to The Daily Beast: To make matters worse for the Trump Foundation, the probe may not be limited to New York: Charity experts and lawyers tell The Daily Beast that the attorneys general of other states may soon get involved in a long, drawn-out process.All major charities are required to register with 41 different states across the nation in order to individually request permission to fundraise. When Trump raised money for veterans, he may have broken the rules in dozens of states. The president of the National Committee for Responsible Philanthropy, Aaron Dorfman, stated: The Trump Foundation would be required to file similar paperwork with the attorneys generals of nearly every other state, and they could all take similar action. It is likely that other states will follow suit and they will be issued cease and desist orders denying them fundraising privileges in other states. That is the most likely next step. This is not good news for Trump who keeps trying to pivot to slamming Hillary Clinton s Clinton Foundation. You know, the one that helps fight AIDS in nations globally.Trump, of course, likes to pretend that he s holier than thou, which might explain why Trump Foundation money was used to buy pictures of, well, himself.And according to Real Clear Politics: From 2011 through 2014, Trump harnessed his eponymous foundation to send at least $286,000 to influential conservative or policy groups, a RealClearPolitics review of the foundation s tax filings found. In many cases, this flow of money corresponded to prime speaking slots or endorsements that aided Trump as he sought to recast himself as a plausible Republican candidate for president. Finding out Trump is a scam artist using a shell charity with his same name really should come as no surprise. Especially to fund his political ambitions of grandeur. However, it will be interesting to see how this story develops as the November election draws nearer.Featured Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images",Fake
" Insane Racist Fired For Death Threats Against Muslims â€˜Parked Too Closeâ€™ At Walmart You thought the people passing through Fargo, North Dakota were crazy. Now we have to worry about wood chippers in the Wal-Mart parking lot.On Tuesday, genuinely terrifying racist Amber E. Hensley confronted some Muslim women who she felt had  parked too close  for her to get in her car, although vehicle proximity may not have been the only factor, it appears. In mere moments, the disagreement turned into death threats against sisters Sarah and Laleyla Hassan and another passenger in their car, Rowda Soyan. All are Somali-American Muslims.The trio was on their way to see a movie, Raw Story reports, when they were approached by Hensley, who shouted at them through the window of their car. After exchanging taunts about who was or was not an American, the sister with the camera, Sarah, asked the woman  what are you gonna do?  Hensley leaned in and told the young women just what her intentions were: We re gonna kill all of ya. We re gonna kill every one of you fuckin  Muslims.Later, she asked the would-be moviegoers  why are you in our country, anyway? Hensley was fired nearly as soon as the video went public. From a statement issued by Horab & Wentz, the accounting firm where she previously worked:The women, of course, disagreed about what happened when the camera wasn t rolling. After her firing, Amber Hensley posted an  apology  on her now-deleted Facebook page:In an interview with the Twin Cities Pioneer Press, Sarah Hassan denied ever having insulted Jesus.We Muslims, we believe in Jesus, too. If I abuse Jesus it s like I m abusing my own god and I not going to be considered a Muslim.This is a common mistake among Christians who don t know anything about Islam. There are a great many parallels between the two Abrahamic religions, although names differ between them. In addition to lying about what Sarah said, Sarah claims that Hensley also mocked her sister Lalelya s crossed eyes and said it was the reason the women were parked so poorly.Amber Hensley was, of course, a big fan of Donald Trump:Trump may have said some things years ago  But Hilary has BLOOD on her hands!

"Manafort money laundering charge in Russia probe may face challenges (Reuters) - When the lawyer for the former campaign manager of President Donald Trump attacked the money laundering charge brought against his client as flimsy, some legal experts say he may have pinpointed a potential weakness in the indictment by U.S. special counsel Robert Mueller. Paul Manafort and his associate Rick Gates both pleaded not guilty on Monday to charges that they failed to disclose they were lobbying for pro-Russia former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich between 2006 and 2015 and laundered tens of millions of dollars by funneling the money through dozens of companies, partnerships and bank accounts. In a court filing on Thursday, Manafort defense lawyer Kevin Downing said the money laundering count, the most serious facing his client with a 20-year maximum sentence, was based on a â€œtenuous legal theoryâ€ tying it to his failure to register as a foreign agent of the former Ukrainian leader.  Downing did not respond to a request for comment. Mueller spokesman Peter Carr declined to comment. The language of the filing and defiant statements Downing made outside the courthouse following Manafortâ€™s arraignment on Monday suggest the lawyer is planning an aggressive defense of the charges, the first to be made public from Muellerâ€™s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The Kremlin has denied meddling and Trump has said there was no collusion. Neither Trump nor his campaign was mentioned in the indictments issued on Monday. Downing will also be seeking to suppress evidence he said was improperly obtained by search warrant, according to an additional filing on Friday. Manafortâ€™s Virginia home was raided by Federal Bureau of Investigation agents over the summer. The money laundering statute targets financial transactions involving the proceeds of â€œspecified unlawful activity.â€ According to the Manafort indictment, the unlawful activity was his violation of the U.S. Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA). Though the money laundering statute includes FARA violations, Seattle tax lawyer John Colvin said the charge against Manafort was not as straightforward as most other cases. â€œIt doesnâ€™t fit the normal paradigmâ€ of money-laundering cases involving criminal activity like drug trafficking, Colvin said. â€œIt seems like a stretch to me.â€  Downing said in his Thursday filing that only six prosecutions have been brought for violating FARA in the last 50 years, producing only one conviction. By pointing out the lack of previous FARA prosecutions, former federal prosecutor Mark Lee, now a white-collar defense lawyer in Philadelphia, said Downing was likely trying to suggest Manafort may not even have known he was violating the law. The section cited by Mueller requires the FARA violation to be â€œknowing and willful.â€ Successfully casting doubt on whether Manafort intentionally violated FARA could knock out the money laundering charge, Lee said. â€œIf you donâ€™t have a (specific unlawful activity), you canâ€™t by definition have a laundering,â€ said Lee. Former federal prosecutor Michael Padula, now a Miami defense lawyer, said parts of the money laundering statute also require funds to â€œpromoteâ€ an ongoing criminal enterprise. That may be hard to show in the Manafort case, where the proceeds went to purchase real estate, expensive suits and Range Rovers for the conspiratorâ€™s personal use. But other lawyers said they doubted defense arguments regarding FARA would gain much traction. â€œThe idea that somebody of Mr. Manafortâ€™s background and sophistication would not understand that, if he did what he is alleged to have done, he would be required to file as an agent of a foreign government, is, I think, laughable,â€ said Chicago lawyer and former federal prosecutor Patrick Cotter. Several lawyers noted that, even without the money laundering counts, Mueller had strong charges based on the failure of Manafort and Gates to report their overseas accounts to the Internal Revenue Service and that the entirety of the case appeared to be backed by strong documentary evidence. They also pointed out that Mueller could add more charges at a later date. â€œItâ€™s an argument, not a get out of jail free card,â€ said Padula of Downingâ€™s money laundering defense. â€œHeâ€™s still got a tough road ahead of him.â€  ",Real
"U.S. industry seeks faster permits, simpler rules in Trump regulation reset WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. industry groups have told President Donald Trumpâ€™s administration that they want two main things from his promised regulatory overhaul: a speedier permit process and simpler environmental rules. Associations representing the drilling, refining, mining, and building industries have submitted hundreds of pages of documents to the Commerce Department and Environmental Protection Agency in recent weeks, outlining regulations they want to see eliminated or modified. The comments, many targeting the EPA, come in response to a pair of executive orders Trump signed during his first weeks in office, meant to cut the regulatory burden on companies. Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress have already moved to rescind a slew of Obama-era environmental protections, including some aimed at combating global climate change. The EPAâ€™s regulatory reform office alone has received remarks from more than 65,000 people and groups, many of them criticizing the regulatory rollback plan as a potential threat to public health. But business groups have embraced the plan, calling it the best chance in more than a decade to reshape the regulatory landscape and boost growth, without undermining air and water quality. â€œLast time I remember this was 2001. That was the last big opportunity to make some changes,â€ said David Friedman, vice president of regulatory affairs for the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers industry group.  That year, then Vice President Dick Cheney chaired an energy task force that produced a National Energy Policy report, a road map to boosting domestic systems and supplies. Much has changed since: U.S. oil and gas production hit all-time highs during the administration of former President Barack Obama, helped by high crude prices and improved drilling technology. This time around, industry groups appear focused on easing the permitting process for new facilities and installations, according to a Reuters review of the comments. A common refrain, for example, is for Trumpâ€™s administration to reject a planned tightening of ozone rules under the U.S. Clean Air Actâ€™s National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Several groups said this would expose them to increased permitting hurdles for operations and new facilities. Several groups mentioned other permitting requirements under the Clean Air Act that they say are redundant. These include the New Source Performance Standards, the Maximum Achievable Control Technology rules and the National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants.  â€œWe have one proposal to replace eight different regulations with one that achieves the same environmental benefit but substantially reduces the cost of compliance,â€ said Rosario Palmieri, vice president for regulatory policy at the National Association of Manufacturers.  The American Petroleum Institute representing oil and gas companies and the Edison Electric Institute, representing electric utilities, are seeking changes in the way companies must account for greenhouse gas emissions. Comments from members of the public and environmental groups revealed worries that this process would undermine environmental protections. The EPAâ€™s comment period ended on May 15. Jeff Baker, a military veteran and energy investor from Alabama wrote: â€œI implore you, as defenders of our nationâ€™s health and security, to avoid shortsighted steps that might create prosperity for a few in the short term, at the expense of the many in the long term.â€ Trumpâ€™s administration requested the comments from industry as part of two similar and concurrent processes, stemming from his executive orders.  The first order, issued on Jan. 24, directed Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to review which U.S. regulations were burdens for domestic manufacturing. The Commerce Department solicited feedback from industry as a result of that order, with a March 31 deadline. Ross told Reuters in an interview last week that the department was condensing the comments into a series of recommendations that could be presented to Trump as early as this month. [nL1N1IB240] The second order was issued Feb. 24, directing all U.S. agency heads to launch a process to identify regulatory burdens. Each agency has its own timetable. The EPA, which is taking the brunt of the feedback, started its public comment period on April 11 and closed it this week. ",Real
"Two Democratic senators threaten to hold up Trump EPA nominee WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two Democratic senators said on Wednesday they may hold up the confirmation of President Donald Trumpâ€™s Environmental Protection Agency nominee Susan Bodine until she explains her advisory role at the agency, which may violate federal law. Senators Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Jeff Merkley of Oregon sent a list of questions to Bodine, Trumpâ€™s pick to head up the EPAâ€™s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assistance, about her current role as special counsel to EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt while she waits out the confirmation process. Whitehouse and Merkley said by advising Pruitt on enforcement matters before being confirmed by the Senate, Bodine may be violating the Federal Vacancies Reform Act that prohibits nominees from assuming the authorities of the office before being confirmed by Congress. â€œYour appointment creates the appearance, and perhaps the effect, of circumventing the Senateâ€™s constitutional advice and consent responsibility for the position to which you have been nominated,â€ the Senators wrote.Â   This means that subjects of EPA enforcement actions could potentially challenge the validity of these actions in court if her role in these decisions is deemed â€œimproper,â€ they said.  Pruitt is the only EPA appointee to have been confirmed since Trump took office in January. Bodine is still awaiting a full Senate vote after her Senate confirmation hearing in July, while four other assistant administrator nominees are set for confirmation hearings on Sept. 20. Democratic lawmakers have been at odds with Pruitt since his narrow-margin confirmation in February over his close ties to industry, his doubts about human-caused climate change, planned drastic cuts of the EPAâ€™s budget and workforce and ethics requirements for political appointees. The senators also asked Bodine if she was involved in a recent EPA decision to enforce an Obama-era rule to regulate methane leaks from new oil and gas infrastructure on a â€œcase by caseâ€ basis rather than fully enforcing it. Republican Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, chair of the Senate environment committee, said Bodine should get her full Senate vote immediately. â€œIt is a shame that the critical post of the assistant administrator charged with leading enforcement at the EPA remains unfilled,â€ Barrasso said through a spokesman.  The EPA was not immediately available for comment. ",Real
"Sexual misconduct allegations may roil 2018 U.S. congressional elections WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A spate of sexual misconduct accusations against U.S. politicians and other powerful men will force candidates for the November 2018 congressional elections to weigh more carefully than ever whether their past behavior could doom their chances.  Following allegations against Republican U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore, Democratic U.S. Representative John Conyers and Democratic U.S. Senator Al Franken, campaign operatives from both parties warned that past behavior that might once have been excused may now be disqualifying. â€œThis is a game-changer,â€ said Democratic strategist Dane Strother. â€œEvery man who wants to run for office needs to give some serious thought to his past.â€ Politicians have been among a growing number of prominent men, including in the entertainment and media fields, accused of sexual harassment. There will be increased pressure on candidates to undertake â€œself-vetting,â€ where, as one Republican strategist said, they are willing to subject themselves to a â€œtrial on what the other side will put them through.â€ But he cautioned: â€œA lot of this is still dependent on what the candidate is willing to talk about and how forthcoming they are.â€ In next yearâ€™s elections, Democrats will seek to wrest one or both houses of Congress from Republican control. Thirty-three U.S. Senate seats and all 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives will be contested.  Sex scandals have long been a part of U.S. politics, but in the current environment, operatives are encouraging candidates and office-holders alike to level with advisers about past conduct, even behavior that might in the past have fallen into a gray area. â€œYou may have to press the candidate particularly aggressively to be sure that he confronts what he may have passed off as a failed advance and not have imagined would come back to haunt him,â€ a veteran Democratic lawyer who advises campaigns told Reuters. Sonia Van Meter, a Democratic opposition researcher, said candidates would have to think carefully about â€œtheir demeanor, their offhanded remarks, the way they carried themselves. Everything will be under more scrutiny.â€ If candidates are not careful about self-vetting, operatives said, researchers working for opposing candidates would do it for them. Verifiable facts - court documents, voting records, speeches and more - usually form the backbone of opposition research conducted by rival campaigns. Such research may expand into behavior that has not been documented, Strother said, adding that might include conversations with former female staffers to find out if there are any issues. Tracy Sefl, a strategist in Chicago who has directed opposition research for the Democratic National Committee, said workplace relationships between a male candidate and women  could now be targeted by opposing campaigns. â€œIn the context of employment: Was a man supervising women? Were those women younger, older, or his peers?â€ Sefl said. â€œHow long did those women tend to work there? What do they have to say about their experience there and about him, specifically?â€  But Alex Conant, a Republican consultant who worked for presidential candidates Tim Pawlenty and Marco Rubio, doubted opposition research would see a dramatic shift, largely because most campaigns cannot afford it and must instead rely on public records, internet searches and news reports.  â€œOpposition research in early stages of congressional campaigns is not going back and interviewing every single person who has worked with a candidate,â€ Conant said. There are also limits on the effectiveness of opposition research in identifying potential misconduct.  Rumors surrounding Mooreâ€™s alleged interest in teenage girls had circulated in Alabama politics for years, but it took reporters from the Washington Post, not researchers from campaigns, to persuade his accusers to go on the record. Moore, who is running against Democrat Doug Jones in a Dec. 12 special election, has denied the allegations, which Reuters has been unable to independently verify. Republican lawmakers in Washington, including Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, have distanced themselves from Moore and urged him to quit the race. Self-vetting is all the more important, operatives said, because the national parties have little capacity to weed out problematic candidates. In 2016, the insurgent White House bids of Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Bernie Sanders highlighted the limited ability of parties to hand-pick candidates for major public offices. Trump won the presidency despite himself being accused by several women of having in the past made unwanted sexual advances or inappropriate personal remarks about them. Trump denied the allegations, saying they were part of a smear campaign. In the race for the U.S. Senate seat in Alabama, Moore prevailed in the Republican primary over Luther Strange, the incumbent backed by the party establishment.  While the parties still vet some candidates for Congress and big-ticket donors, they largely rely on local party officials to screen and refer them. Van Meter said the string of scandals had altered the landscape because victims now felt empowered to go public, which may topple some candidates and keep others from running at all. â€œWhat has changed is the culture, the number of women coming forward,â€ she said. â€œWeâ€™re going to see more of these cases.â€ ",Real
"Firm behind Trump dossier declines to respond to House panel's subpoena WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. political research firm that commissioned a dossier on Donald Trump while he was running for president said on Monday it would not comply with subpoenas issued by the U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee. Lawyers for Fusion GPS, which hired former British spy Christopher Steele to produce the Trump research, told the committeeâ€™s Republican chairman, U.S. Representative Devin Nunes, in a letter that the subpoenas were flawed and that nothing in the subpoenas indicated the intelligence committee had authorized him to issue them. The lawyers also questioned Nunesâ€™ role in signing the subpoenas since he had recused himself from the committeeâ€™s investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. â€œThis act is another example of how you, as chair, have run your own operation in parallel to the committeeâ€™s investigation,â€ they said. The lawyers noted the subpoenas, which have not been made public, ordered the Central Intelligence Agency to produce documents but pointed out that the Fusion GPS firm and its representatives who received subpoenas have no relationship with the CIA. The letter accuses the House committee of â€œbad faith interactionsâ€ with Fusionâ€™s lawyers and says that â€œyou have left us no choice but to advise our clients to assert their privileges in the face of these subpoenas.â€ It requests that the committee excuse the Fusion representatives from testifying before the committee and that if they are forced to appear, they â€œwill invoke their constitutional privileges not to testify.â€ Representatives for Nunes did not immediately respond to emails requesting comment. In August, the Senate Judiciary committee, which also is investigating Steeleâ€™s dossier, met for more than 10 hours with Fusion founder Glenn Simpson. The committee has not released a transcript of Simpsonâ€™s testimony. The dossier assembled by former MI6 officer Christopher Steele outlined Russian financial and personal links to Trumpâ€™s campaign and associates. The Senate Intelligence Committee and special counsel Robert Mueller are looking into  possible collusion between Russia and Trumpâ€™s campaign and Muellerâ€™s investigators have met with Steele.

"Trump says he's likely to sign healthcare order this week WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he likely will sign an order this week that is expected to allow Americans to buy stripped-down health insurance policies, a step some experts say would further undermine the Obamacare law that Trump opposes. Unable to win passage of legislation to dismantle the 2010 law in a Congress led by his own party, Trump indicated he would take unilateral action. He offered few specifics beyond saying his action would let people cross state lines to obtain â€œgreat, competitive healthcareâ€ costing the United States â€œnothing.â€ The expected order would allow small businesses and individuals to band together as associations to buy health insurance plans that would be exempt from some Obamacare requirements. These include mandatory coverage for 10 essential health benefits such as maternity and newborn care, prescription drugs and mental health treatment.  It would also expand the amount of time people can use short-term medical insurance plans, which are cheaper than traditional plans but cover a limited set of benefits. People could use those plans for up to a year, compared to three months under current law.  â€œIâ€™ll also be signing something, probably this week, which is going to go a long way to take care of many of the people that have been so badly hurt on healthcare,â€ Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. â€œWith Congress the way it is, I decided to take it upon myself,â€ Trump added, saying the plan is â€œlargely worked out.â€ White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Trump will make his announcement â€œby the end of Friday.â€ Trump said his action would let insurers sell across state lines. The association health plans, for instance, could be sold from a state with fewer benefit requirements. Such insurance policies could be cheaper than those that provide the full range of medical coverage required under Obamacare, potentially making them attractive to people in other states. It is unclear when these plans would become available. It is unlikely consumers could sign up for these plans during the 2018 open enrollment period, which begins Nov. 1.  Experts questioned Trumpâ€™s authority to issue such an order that would exempt some plans but not others from Obamacare rules rather than pursuing the changes through legislation. The action could open Trump to legal challenges from Democratic state attorneys general, who have said they will sue Trump if he tries to destroy Obamacare. The plans allowed under the order could lure young and healthy people away from the individual insurance markets created by the 2010 Affordable Care Act, dubbed Obamacare. That could further destabilize those markets, where insurers have already exited the markets altogether, pared back offerings or hiked premiums because of uncertainty caused by the Trump administration.  Experts said Trumpâ€™s plan could leave behind only the sickest people in the Obamacare markets, raising premiums and effectively eroding the lawâ€™s protection that people with pre-existing medical conditions cannot be charged more. â€œThereâ€™s a general belief that at every turn the federal government is going to create regulations to hurt rather than help the markets,â€ said Craig Garthwaite, director of the healthcare program at Northwestern Universityâ€™s Kellogg School of Management, referring to the Trump administration.  â€œIt unwinds the ability of people with pre-existing conditions to get insurance under the ACA,â€ Garthwaite said. Republicans have failed to make good on their seven-year promise to repeal and replace Obamacare, the signature domestic policy achievement of Trumpâ€™s Democratic predecessor Barack Obama. Gutting Obamacare was a top Trump campaign promise. Trump, who has called the law a failure and vowed to let it â€œimplode,â€ has undermined Obamacare through regulatory and administrative actions. Last week, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued a rule that will let businesses and non-profit organizations lodge religious or moral objections to obtain an exemption from the lawâ€™s mandate that employers provide birth control for women in health insurance with no co-payment. Trump has declined to commit to making payments guaranteed to insurers under Obamacare. The payments are estimated to be about $7 billion this year and help lower out-of-pocket medical costs for low-income consumers. Insurers have cited that uncertainty in exiting insurance markets or hiking premiums.  His administration has slashed the Obamacare advertising budget, halved the open enrollment period and cut funding to groups that help sign people up for insurance under the law. ",Real
" Trump Blames Computer Failure For Worldwide Chaos He Caused With Muslim Ban In yet another morning rant, Donald Trump blamed anyone and anything but himself for the constitutional crisis and global chaos caused by his Muslim ban.On Friday, Trump signed an executive order banning travelers from seven countries where Trump thinks terrorists come from. However, the countries listed are not responsible for any deaths on American soil, unlike Saudi Arabia, where the 9/11 attackers were from and received their funding.Trump s ban has caused chaos at airports around the world as thousands of people have been detained, even children, the elderly, and permanent American citizens who hold green cards.It s a nightmare that could have been avoided simply by not being racist dick.But Trump took to Twitter on Sunday to defend his ban.Our country needs strong borders and extreme vetting, NOW.

Also, the  bad dudes  who committed the mass shootings in Orlando, Ft. Hood, and San Bernardino that Trump points to in order to justify his ban were all born in America. So unless Trump is capable of finding out whether babies are bad or good, he has no justification for the ban.Also, blaming machines and other people for the chaos your executive order is causing is very weak. The Delta computer outage occurred late Sunday, nearly two full days after the executive order was signed. Protesters and Senator Schumer were not responsible for the many people who were detained or blocked from entering this country to reunite with family. That included two Christian families from Syria who were sent back to the war-torn country where they face persecution and possible death despite Trump promising that Christian refugees would not be impacted by the ban.Twitter users were quick to pound Trump into oblivion..@realDonaldTrump You re the President, not a Ninja Turtle.

" Trump-Loving Oklahoma GOP Rep. Busted Calling For Hillary Clintonâ€™s Murder (SCREENSHOTS) What is it with Trump supporters constantly threatening future President Hillary Clinton s life? Oklahoma state Rep. John Bennett, who endorsed The Donald last year, decided he needed a little something to help his re-election bid next week, so he skipped straight from  lock her up  to  hang her and lock her up if you can t    a message that is sure to be popular with Deplorables who happen to escape from their basket.Linking a far-Right blog post blaming Clinton for the Benghazi attacks (come on, guys, this dead horse is beginning to smell terrible), Bennett offered a solution to dealing with this imagined criminal for her non-existent crimes: murder.After removing the post failed to make it go away because screenshots exist, Bennett moved on to damage control, explaining that he doesn t wish death on anyone   because he apparently meant the kind of firing squad that shoots water guns. He explains that she should be charged with treason or thrown in jail for whatever the f*ck he thinks she did this week, though he did not say whom would be the judge in this case since no actual judge would participate in this bit of dumbfuckery   we can only assume he would nominate himself to pronounce her guilty and get the ball rolling on the whole murder thing.Threatening a presidential candidate is a felony offense, but for some reason Trumpsters never seem to be held responsible for their actions. Hopefully, since this threat was made by an elected official, things will be different this time.Featured image via screengrab",Fake

"Trump close to decision on addressing Chinese trade practices WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is close to a decision on how to respond to what he considers Chinaâ€™s unfair trade practices, a senior Trump administration official said on Tuesday. Trump is considering encouraging U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to initiate an investigation of Chinese trade practices under the 1974 Trade Actâ€™s section 301, the official said. An announcement could come as early as this week, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 allows the president to unilaterally impose tariffs or other trade restrictions to protect U.S. industries from â€œunfair trade practicesâ€ of foreign countries, such as trade agreement violations, or â€œdiscriminatoryâ€ actions that burden U.S. commerce. The United States has a long list of grievances about China on trade, including accusations of steel dumping and theft of U.S. intellectual property. China has said that trade between China and the United States benefits both sides and that Beijing is willing to work with Washington to improve their trade relationship. Trump has long been a critic of Chinese trade practices but his interest in penalizing Beijing has risen because of his concern at what he perceives to be Chinese inaction on reining in increasingly belligerent North Korea. The United States has pressed China to exert more economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea to help rein in its nuclear and missile programs. Beijing has repeatedly said its influence on North Korea is limited and that it is doing all it can. A senior Chinese official said on Monday there was no link between North Koreaâ€™s nuclear program and China-U.S. trade. Susan Thornton, acting assistant secretary of state for East Asia, told a congressional hearing on Tuesday that new U.S. sanctions aimed at curbing North Koreanâ€™s weapons programs, including measures aimed at Chinese financial institutions, could be expected â€œfairly soon.â€ Section 301 was used extensively in the 1980s to combat Japanese imports of motorcycles, steel and other products - an era during which Lighthizer served as deputy U.S. trade representative. The statute has been little used since the World Trade Organization was launched in 1995. The WTO provides a forum for resolving trade disputes, but Lighthizer and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross have complained that it is extremely slow, often taking years to reach a conclusion, and that the Geneva-based organization has an inherent anti-U.S. bias. Both Chinaâ€™s Foreign Ministry and Commerce Ministry did not respond immediately to requests for comment. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang met Michiganâ€™s governor Rick Snyder in Beijing on Tuesday, where he said the common interests of China and  the United States were bigger than any disputes. â€œChina welcomes U.S. states, including Michigan, to ... enhance bilateral trade and investment, ... and consolidate and expand cooperative consensus to create better development opportunities and jobs for both countriesâ€™ peoples,â€ Li told Snyder, according to a Chinese government statement. â€œThe Trump administration believes in free and fair trade and will use every available tool to counter the protectionism of those who pledge allegiance to free trade while violating its core principles,â€ Ross said in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece on Tuesday.  He tried to refute arguments that the Trump administration was taking a protectionist stance, saying that both China and Europe were more protectionist because they subsidized export industries and had â€œformidable tariff and non-tariff trade barriers against imports.â€ â€œChina is not a market economy. The Chinese government creates national champions and takes other actions that significantly distort markets,â€ Ross wrote. â€œResponding to such actions with trade remedies is not protectionist.â€ ",Real
" Trump Cancels Air Force One, The Reason Why Is INSANE (TWEET/VIDEO) This morning, President-elect made yet another disastrous announcement over Twitter, when he send out a tweet that called for the cancellation of the Air Force One contract. The contract, which was for an update on the presidential plane, was apparently too much money and Trump wants to do away with the deal. And as expected, Trump s reasoning behind this was riddled with misinformation.Trump tweeted that he was going to cancel the contract with Boeing because of the hefty $4 billion price tag. However, $4 billion is practically a mysterious, made-up number from Trump   no one knows where he got that number. According to reports, the Air Force would only cost $1.6 billion for the project, which included SEVERAL planes. Trump is blindly throwing out a number more than twice that amount, for only one plane. Trump tweeted: Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! TwitterOf course, Trump tweeting falsehoods is hardly a surprise at this point   but he made it worse by addressing the press shortly after his tweet. During his brief moment with the press, one reporter asked Trump: Sir, you tweeted about canceling the contract about the new Air Force One? Trump gloated and made this ridiculous announcement even worse by saying this: Well, the plane is totally out of control. It s going to be over $4 billion. It s for Air Force One program, and I think it s ridiculous. Then, Trump attacked Boeing and accused the company of scamming America (obviously, the irony of this is lost on him). He said: I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money. You can watch the interview below: The insanity of this whole thing is that Trump is supposedly cancelling this deal over its large (made up) price tag, but he s thinking nothing of costing tax payers $1 million per day to pay for the security costs while he stays in the Trump Tower instead of the White House.Featured image via Maddie McGarvey / Getty Images",Fake
"Key Republican Collins has 'serious concerns' on healthcare bill WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine said on Sunday she has extreme reservations about the U.S. Senateâ€™s healthcare overhaul and does not think it will be able to pass this week. Collins, a moderate Republican who has not taken a formal stance on the bill, said she was concerned it would cut Medicaid too deeply and said she wants to see an upcoming analysis by the Congressional Budget Office before making a decision. â€œI have very serious concerns about the bill,â€ she said on ABCâ€™s â€œThis Weekâ€ program. â€œItâ€™s hard for me to see the bill passing this week.â€ Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has pushed for a vote before the July 4th Independence Day holiday recess that begins at the end of this week. He can afford to lose the support of only two Republicans in the face of unanimous Democratic opposition. Five Republican senators have announced they will not support the bill, which is designed to repeal and replace Obamacare, in its current form. One of those senators, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, called on Sunday for a slowdown in the process to give the Senate and the public time to evaluate the healthcare bill. â€œWe donâ€™t have enough information. I donâ€™t have the feedback from constituencies who will not have had enough time to view the Senate bill. We should not be voting on this next week,â€ he said on NBCâ€™s â€œMeet the Press.â€ Another senator who has announced that he does not support the current version of the bill, Rand Paul of Kentucky, said he would back it if the Senate reached an impasse on healthcare. â€œIf we get to impasse, if we go to a bill that is more repeal and less big government programs, yes Iâ€™ll consider partial repeal,â€ Paul said on ABC. The Senateâ€™s 142-page proposal, worked out in secret by a group led by McConnell, aims to deliver on a central campaign promise of President Donald Trump to undo former President Barack Obamaâ€™s signature healthcare law, which has provided coverage to 20 million Americans since it was passed in 2010. Republicans view the law, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, as a costly government intrusion and say individual insurance markets created by it are collapsing. â€œI think they have, at best, a 50-50 chance of passing this bill,â€ Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said on ABC. He said Democrats â€œare doing everything we can to fight this bill because itâ€™s so devastating for the middle class.â€ The House of Representatives has passed a measure similar to the Senate plan. The Senate would phase out Obamacareâ€™s expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor more gradually than the House bill, waiting until after the 2020 presidential election, but would enact deeper cuts starting in 2025.

"Trump's EPA to reconsider oil and gas emissions rule WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will reconsider a rule on greenhouse gas emissions from oil and gas operations and delay its compliance date, the agency said on Wednesday in the Trump administrationâ€™s latest move to reduce regulations. Oil interest groups, including the American Petroleum Institute and the Texas Oil and Gas Association, had petitioned the EPA a year ago to reconsider the rule limiting emissions of   methane and other pollutants from new and revamped oil and gas wells and systems.  The EPA said in a statement that it would delay the ruleâ€™s June 3 compliance date by 90 days and take public comments during that period. Under Democratic President Barack Obama, the EPA released the first methane limits on the facilities in May 2016, saying it would cost energy companies $530 million, but would lead to $690 million in benefits, including lowering medical bills.  Scott Pruitt, the EPA chief in the administration of Republican President Donald Trump, joined dozens of other states  in challenging the rule when he was attorney general of oil-producing Oklahoma. Pruitt has said he does not believe that greenhouse gas emissions are the main driver of climate change.  Energy companies had complained that the methane rule would add costs to wells that were not producing much oil and gas, and that it was duplicative as the sector had already reduced the emissions. Environmentalists believe limiting methane, a gas about 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide in trapping heat, is a low-hanging fruit in efforts to curb climate change.  Michelle Robinson, director of the clean vehicles program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said EPA was favoring industry over science. â€œInstead of looking backwards to review well-reasoned rules based on clear science, the administration should be moving forward,â€ and extend methane limits, she said.  Wednesdayâ€™s move signaled another retreat from climate change action after the Trump administration in March halted an effort to gather methane data from existing oil and gas operations to rein in leaks of the powerful greenhouse gas. In late March, Trump signed an order to undo climate regulations, following up on a campaign promise.  Pruitt said the EPA is continuing to follow through with Trumpâ€™s order. â€œAmerican businesses should have the opportunity to review new requirements, assess economic impacts and report back, before those new requirements are finalized,â€ he said.

" Obama Cancels â€˜Sleepâ€™ Plans, Will Stick Around To Save The Democratic Party Instead Earlier this year, President Obama joked that as soon as he was out of office he would set aside three to four months to sleep off the previous eight years, but those plans are officially canceled thanks to Donald Trump. Months ago Obama, like the rest of us, expected Hillary Clinton to win the election. Past staying in Washington, D.C. while Sasha finished school, the Obamas  futures were not set in stone. Now, out of a sense of duty to his country, the President says he will do what he must to save the Democratic Party.In the November 28 edition of The New Yorker, Obama says that he d be done if Hillary Clinton was going to be our next President, but Trump s  landslide victory  gives him no choice but to stay in politics for a while: I think that if Hillary Clinton had won the election then I d just turn over the keys,  he said.  We d make sure the briefing books were in order and out we go. I think now I have some responsibility to at least offer my counsel to those who will continue to be elected officials about how the D.N.C. can help rebuild, how state parties and progressive organizations can work together. But don t worry, Republicans, the President made it clear that he won t be declaring himself Emperor-For-Life, no matter how many scary right-wing conspiracy websites told you he would:Not long before the election, Valerie Jarrett, the senior aide with the closest relationship to the Obamas, asked the President,  Don t you sometimes wish you could run for another term? I m sure you could win, and there s so much more to do. Obama had no appetite for superseding the Twenty-second Amendment.  I said no, because, look, at some point you lose touch,  he recounted.  By being in this room. At some point, you get worn down. At some point, you start getting into bad habits. I told her,  We re playing on house money here. We weren t supposed to be here. For us to have had this opportunity and to be able to make this much change, as much as we wish that we could have gotten everything done, it s remarkable. What will be Obama s role in the Trumpocalypse? That much is unclear   but the party will be much better off with him involved than otherwise.Featured image via Getty Images/Carsten Koall",Fake
" Trump Names Alt-Right Racist As His Chief Strategist (VIDEO) If anyone had any deluded designs that Donald Trump wasn t going to stack his staff with racists, they were sadly mistaken. Trump has named Steve Bannon, the guy who runs the alt-right website Breitbart, as his chief strategist. Paul Ryan went on television this morning and tried to say that the Trump Administration and the Republican Party do not condone racism and hate, but all of that just went out the window with this appointment. Here is video of that interaction with CNN s Jake Tapper:[ad3media campaign= 1347 ]The Trump campaign released the following statement regarding Trump s appointments   and of course it doesn t address the fact that Bannon is a bona fide racist:  I am thrilled to have my very successful team continue with me in leading our country. Steve and Reince are highly qualified leaders who worked well together on our campaign and led us to a historic victory. Now I will have them both with me in the White House as we work to make America great again. So, in other words, Trump and his team are in no way concerned about the racist hate crimes that have been cropping up around the country as a result of Trump s getting elected. If the GOP wants the nation and world to think that they are not racists, this is definitely NOT the way to do it. Trump himself is a racist, and Bannon is a huge racist as well.Buckle your seatbelts, folks.

" Pastor Decides Straight Couple Canâ€™t Even SUPPORT Marriage Equality, Cancels Their Wedding I m shooting for irony here, so bear with me: Thank GOD some people proclaim their bigotry out loud, so you don t have to find out the hard way.Okay, so this couple (who are choosing to remain anonymous) kind of did find out the hard way, but they re still free to make other arrangements after the minister of their church called them into a private meeting to let them know he would no longer perform their ceremony or allow them to marry in his church.Pictured: IronyThe problem, according to Minister Steven North of Ebenezer St. John s Presbyterian Church, was the bride s recent comment on Facebook in support of marriage equality in her native Australia. The country is holding a survey   because some places value the individual input of their citizens   to help the Australian parliament decide whether or not to allow same-sex couples to marry.Apparently, the clergyman was monitoring the bride-to-be s social media, where she spoke up in support of the measure: I know it s something not everyone will agree on and that s fine but this is what I stand for and frankly it doesn t effect [sic] my relationship with [my partner] one bit. That s when North made the decision to summon the couple into his office. Not only did he tell them that he would not perform the ceremony, but he drove the point home with a letter to the couple as well: After the pre-marital counselling that you attended and the sermons delivered at Ebenezer on this subject, you must surely appreciate that your commitment to same-sex marriage opposes the teaching of Christ Jesus and the scriptural position practiced by the Presbyterian Church of Australia and by me. This conflict of views has practical consequences in relation to your upcoming wedding. If I remember correctly   and believe me, as someone who was raised in a very religious household, I do   Jesus said as much about same-sex weddings as He did about abortions or whether His Dad wants you to drink that miracle water that creepy Peter Popoff sells at 2 AM on cable. That is to say, nothing. There were no  teachings of Christ Jesus  on gay marriage. So really the operative part of North s statement is that whole thing at the end where he says  and by me. The bride was having none of it. The couple has decided to leave their long-time church, and they did so with a statement of their own: We feel this decision is absolutely disgraceful and is a disgrace to you and all the church, especially when we have been loyal and valued members of this congregation for 10 years. You were made aware from the beginning of our proceedings that we had gay friends and also that people in our wedding party were gay. How could you assume that we would abandon them or degrade them with regards to same-sex marriage? Rather than acquiesce to the thought police of her bigoted church, this couple has faith that they re doing the right thing.Featured image via Scott Barbour/Getty Images",Fake

Adam Schiff, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee (which is conducting its own investigation into Russia), just dropped a truth bomb about Comey, and Trump would be wise to go find a cave and hide in it now.Schiff was asked, on CNN, whether he believes this is a cover-up. He doesn t. He thinks it s something worse: It s a brazen interference with a criminal investigation. After all, the president calls this whole investigation a fake, and here you had an FBI director who was seriously looking into whether Trump associates were colluding with the Russians. The end of his statement to CNN should be particularly jarring to anybody familiar with history. Watch below:Rep. Adam Schiff on firing of FBI Director James Comey:  It s a brazen interference with a criminal investigation  https://t.co/5SXgAuTVBP  CNN (@CNN) May 10, 2017Earlier this year, the White House tried to get the FBI to publicly dispute stories appearing in The New York Times about contacts between Trump s associates and Russian actors. They ve been trying to bend the FBI to their will for a long time, and when Comey wouldn t lie under oath for them, or end his Russia probe, Trump decided to fire him.In fact, Jeff Sessions was actually told to find reasons to fire Comey, and they ve been working on it for at least a week. Trump likely wants someone in that position who ll end that investigation before they discover something really damning. He wants a puppet.If Trump was innocent, the White House wouldn t have been looking for reasons to fire Comey now. Comey may not have even been fired, but if he was, Trump probably would have done it when he took office under the guise of getting a fresh start, as Schiff said to CNN.

"Judge orders Illinois to boost Medicaid bill payments CHICAGO (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Friday dealt a major financial blow to Illinois by ordering the cash-strapped state to pay $586 million a month to Medicaid providers to ensure continued medical care for poor and disabled residents. The order by Judge Joan Lefkow also stipulated that Illinois send $2 billion to Medicaid providers during the fiscal year that starts on Saturday to pay down the existing $3.1 billion backlog of unpaid bills. Illinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza, whose office pays the stateâ€™s bills, said the ruling â€œtakes the stateâ€™s finances from horrific to catastrophicâ€ and called on state lawmakers to immediately pass a budget. â€œPayments to the stateâ€™s pension funds; state payroll including legislator pay; general state aid to schools and payments to local governments â€“ in some combination â€“ will likely have to be cut,â€ she said in a statement. â€œPayments to the stateâ€™s bond-holders will continue uninterrupted.â€ The decision came as Illinois lawmakers failed to reach consensus on a budget on Friday, leaving a state with the worst credit rating in the nation poised to enter a third-straight fiscal year without a full operating budget. Governor Bruce Raunerâ€™s office had no comment on the ruling. Lefkow had issued an order on June 7 that concluded Illinois was not complying with federal consent decrees regarding Medicaid. That order allowed attorneys representing Illinoisâ€™ 3 million Medicaid recipients to seek a subsequent order forcing the state to increase payments to managed-care organizations, which in turn pay doctors, hospitals and others. In her latest order, the judge said the state failed to offer a payment plan that would result in substantial compliance with the consent decrees that stemmed from lawsuits filed against Illinois in 1992. Attorneys representing Medicaid recipients said Illinois, which has been allocating only $160 million a month to the healthcare program, will be able to subsequently seek reimbursement for about half of the higher payment from the federal government.  â€œWithout these payments, doctors, hospitals, clinics and other key healthcare providers would stop seeing Medicaid patients, or else simply go out of business altogether,â€ Tom Yates of the Legal Council for Health Justice said in a statement. Illinoisâ€™ unprecedented budget impasse between its Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature has ballooned the stateâ€™s unpaid bill pile to about $15 billion. ",Real
" Donald Trump Congratulates Himself On Winning Election And Asks For Donations While Puerto Ricans BEG For Help During a time of national crisis, most presidents focus on helping people in need. But not Donald Trump. Instead, he is sending out mass text messages to stroke his own ego and try to raise money. He keeps telling his fans that if they don t keep donating, their big election upset will all be for naught. Here are the texts he sent to his most ardent fans (and a few people who just subscribe for the lulz):Now, to put this into context, the people of Puerto Rico are literally dying. Trump has, instead of trying to help them, attacked the mayor of San Juan on Twitter for begging for help to save the lives of the Americans who live there, and his disaster response has been abysmal, because, you know, brown people. And now, he sends out lying mass communications pretending that he has helped people and delivered on promises when he has done no such thing. Hell, there is plenty of evidence that there was even a point in time when Trump didn t even realize that the people of Puerto Rico are American citizens.In short, this is a man who is raising money off the backs of suffering and dying people, and using the protests of NFL players who want to use their platforms to shine a light on the injustices suffered at the hands of law enforcement by people of color to stoke racial divisions in the nation. In fact, there is even evidence that this part of it was planned. MSNBC s Rachel Maddow explains that bit perfectly:Donald Trump s racist, divisive actions are absolutely disgraceful, and people are literally dying on his watch. This man is not a president. He s a racist and a murderer.Featured image via Andrew Harrer-Pool/Getty Images",Fake
" Hackers Reveal Trump Linked The Most Powerful Twitter In The World To A Personal Gmail Account (TWEETS) Donald Trump s administration is already proving to be a complete and utter sh*tshow, but did you know his Twitter security is just as bad as his leadership? The Intercept reports that Donald Trump s Twitter account   that s the one used by the President of the United States   was until today  secured  with a simple Gmail account.Hacker @WauchulaGhost, Trump s @POTUS account was set to a personal gmail apparently belonging to Dan Scavino as well as one that appears to be connected to Donald Trump s website:Hey @POTUS, On a serious note. Lets fix your Security settings. Should I email you? #GhostOfNoNation @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/FRdMJnZaNr  WauchulaGhost (@WauchulaGhost) January 21, 2017Ghost says that @POTUS, @FLOTUS, and @VP are all vulnerable to attacks because the administration that says it will make our country more secure hasn t bothered to set up the most basic security features on the accounts. CNN spoke to the hacker, who shared some grim details about exactly how inept the current administration is:According to WauchulaGhost, @POTUS, @FLOTUS and @VP are more vulnerable because they haven t selected a basic security feature on Twitter that requires you to provide a phone number or email address to reset your password. The current security setting for these three accounts allows anyone to click on  forgot password  and type in @FLOTUS, @POTUS or @VP. The next screen says  we found the following information associated with your account  and gives a partially redacted email address to which it will send a password recovery link.WauchulaGhost says being able to fill in the missing letters and guess someone s email address is the first step hackers take when trying to breach an account. It s not hard for us to go figure out that email,  he told CNNTech in a Twitter direct message.  I ve taken over 500 Islamic State accounts. WauchulaGhost says he found the likely email associated with Melania Trump s handle within twenty minutes. He said the email associated with Vice President Mike Pence was easy to guess once you saw the redacted version: vi***************@gmail.com, which WauchulaGhost pieced together as [email protected] It has since been changed, but the president and first lady s email addresses remain the same. (And the VP account still doesn t have the extra layer of security.)After news broke that Trump had his account connected to gmail, someone on his end rapidly changed email addresses but still didn t change security features, which was kind of fun for Twitter:So I'm thinking it's dstrumppresident2017(@)gmail(.) pic.twitter.com/n3HJm6Bxwr  Alexandra Svokos (@asvokos) January 26, 2017UPDATE: Second email account added to @POTUS pic.twitter.com/TcqfLHAfkW  Alexandra Svokos (@asvokos) January 26, 2017Update 2: Gmail account now taken off @POTUS.

No, no,  Baldwin s Trump told the media when asked about the pee parties.  I m not talking about the pee-pee. It didn t happen. It wasn t as cool as it sounds. Next question.

" Trump Just ADMITTED He Mindlessly Parrots Russian Propaganda And Twitter Kicked His Teeth In (TWEETS) Donald Trump once said that he loves  the poorly educated,  and he skips his intelligence briefings regularly, so it is reasonable to assume that he is not a fan of  intelligence  in any form. But on Thursday, the Donald took to Twitter to assure everyone that this isn t true   and to backtrack on his agreements with Julian Assange so fast that one is forced to wonder what information he learned about Russia s hack of the election in the past 24 hours.

Nevertheless, though he admits he doesn t look into who gives him information, Assange claims that he didn t receive the emails  from Russia.  On Wednesday, Trump mindlessly parroted the claim because it supports his nonsensical decision to spend every waking moment doing the Twitter equivalent of dropping to his knees in front of Putin and, well, you get the idea.In his nonsensical morning tweet, Wednesday Edition, Trump informed the world that his  intelligence  (yes, he put the word in quotes again) had been delayed by a few days and attacked  intelligence agencies  (he could have meant any of the more than a bakers  dozen who say that Russia absolutely hacked us, and Putin led the operation, but he seems to mean the CIA). This was a lie.He followed that up by spreading Assange s nonsensical claim that their friend Vladdy Poot didn t give him the information and by attacking the DNC for getting hacked.But even though The Donald regularly tweets out agreements with Assange   including the false claim that Russia had nothing to do with the hack (something he would know if he actually attended intelligence briefings)   he says his tweets should not be construed as agreement with the sexual predator behind the release of some of the hacked documents Russian hackers stole.

A few years back, The Donald tweeted that he hopes the brutal Russian dictator becomes his  new best friend. It s nice that we re all friends now, and that Assange and Trump are bonding over the  dishonest press,  but if Trump is getting his  intelligence  from Russia and some rapist, it s time we talk about peacefully removing him from the White House and   what was that thing he wanted to do to his opponent, who had legitimately not committed a crime?

"U.S. court rules Arkansas can block Planned Parenthood funding (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday reversed a ruling that prevented Arkansas from cutting off Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood following the release of controversial videos secretly recorded by an anti-abortion group. The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis reversed a ruling forbidding Arkansas from carrying through with Republican Governor Asa Hutchinsonâ€™s directive to suspend Medicaid reimbursements to a Planned Parenthood affiliate. U.S. District Judge Kristine Baker in Little Rock had ruled in favor of three women who claimed Arkansas violated their rights under the federal Medicaid law to choose any qualified provider offering services they were seeking. But by a 2-1 vote, a 8th Circuit said the provision of the Medicaid law the women relied on does not unambiguously create a federal right for individual patients that they could enforce in court. U.S. Circuit Judge Steven Colloton wrote that the lack of such a right does not mean state officials have unlimited authority to terminate Medicaid providers. â€œWe conclude only that Congress did not unambiguously confer the particular right asserted by the patients in this case,â€ he wrote. U.S. Circuit Judge Michael Melloy dissented, saying four other appeals courts have reached the opposite conclusion and found a private right of enforcement existed. Raegan McDonald-Mosley, chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, in a statement said the fight â€œis not over.â€ â€œWe will do everything in our power to protect our patientsâ€™ access to birth control cancer screenings, and other lifesaving care,â€ McDonald-Mosley said. Arkansas cut off funds for Planned Parenthood after the anti-abortion activist group Center for Medical Progress released videos in 2015 it claimed showed the groupâ€™s officials negotiating the sale of fetal body parts for profit.  Planned Parenthood has denied the allegation and says 13 states that investigated those claims have cleared it of wrongdoing. Hutchinson, who was among Republican governors nationally who targeted the organization following those videos, welcomed Wednesdayâ€™s ruling. â€œThis is a substantial legal victory for the right of the state to determine whether Medicaid providers are acting in accordance with best practices and affirms the prerogative of the state to make reasoned judgments on the Medicaid program,â€ he said in a statement. Planned Parenthood does not perform surgical abortions in Arkansas, which forbids public funding of abortions except in cases of rape or incest. But it provides other gynecological services as well as birth control and breast examinations. ",Real
"Kushner Cos says to skip China marketing push this weekend SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The company owned by the family of senior White House aide Jared Kushner will skip roadshow events in China this weekend seeking money from local investors for a real estate project in exchange for a shot at U.S. immigrant visas, a company spokesman said. Nicole Kushner Meyer, Jaredâ€™s sister, appeared at marketing events last weekend in Beijing and Shanghai in an effort to raise $150 million from Chinese investors through the controversial EB-5 visa-for-investment program. According to marketing materials from one of the organizers of the roadshow, sales events for the project are scheduled in the southern cities of Shenzhen on Saturday and Guangzhou on Sunday. â€œNo one from Kushner Companies will be in China this weekend,â€ James Yolles, spokesman for the firm, said. The company and KABR Group are raising money for a two-tower apartment complex in New Jersey called One Journal Square, marketing materials showed. Kushner Companies earlier this week apologized for Meyer having mentioned Jared Kushner, U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s son-in-law, in discussing the project. The company said Meyer had done so only in an attempt to make clear that her brother was not involved. â€œKushner Companies apologizes if that mention of her brother was in any way interpreted as an attempt to lure investors. That was not Ms. Meyerâ€™s intention,â€ it said. In addition to Meyer, Laurent Morali, president of Kushner Companies, was included in marketing materials online for the China road show. Jared Kushner, whose White House portfolio includes relations with China, sold his stake in Kushner Companies to a family trust early this year. The EB-5 program allows wealthy foreigners to, in effect, buy U.S. immigration visas for themselves and families by investing at least $500,000 in certain development projects. A member of the audience at the marketing event in Shanghai said Meyer spoke for about 10 minutes during last Sundayâ€™s event and described her familyâ€™s humble roots. According to the New York Times, in Beijing on Saturday she told the audience of about 100 people the project â€œmeans a lot to me and my entire familyâ€. ",Real
" Don Trump Jr. Testified To The Senate Today And They Donâ€™t Seem To Believe A Word He Said Donald Trump, Jr. went before Congress today to give yet another version of his reasons for meeting with a Russian lawyer in June of 2016. While he did actually confirm what he said in the email string he was dumb enough to post to Twitter that he met with Natalia Veselnitskaya because she claimed to have dirt on Hillary he gave a ridiculous reason for it. His reason was that he was trying to determine Hillary s fitness for office, because that s a totally innocent reason that makes it all okay.So that makes it all innocent, especially because he also claimed that he was just so overwhelmed with the campaign due to inexperience, but he did still evidently have the presence of mind to know he should talk to legal counsel about the propriety of the meeting and info, or so his claim goes.Some, however, on the Senate Judiciary Committee don t believe him, it seems. Sen. Chris Coons, who sits on that committee, sent out a memo to  interested parties  about Don the Con Jr. and his testimony today, complete with the statute regarding giving false testimony to Congress. And there s no ambiguity about it   the top of the memo says: Below is a statute to keep in mind in regards to Donald Trump Jr. s testimony today. It quotes the full statute, which states that it s illegal to lie to Congress, and then Coons says: It is important to remember that anyone who testifies in front of a Senate committee is under the restrictions of the False Statements statute that says material false statements to Congress are criminal and punishable with fines or imprisonment or both. Read Coons  full memo below:? After Don Jr. testimony to Senate Judiciary Cmte, Sen. Chris Coons  office sends out statute on giving false statements to Congress pic.twitter.com/OUdKXMBfqm  Andrew Desiderio (@desiderioDC) September 7, 2017The many contradictions in Don Jr. s reasons for meeting with Veselnitskaya clearly raise doubts that his testimony today was the truth. He first claimed, months ago, that he didn t meet with any Russians, and then later claimed that meant he didn t meet with any known Russian officials. Then he claimed that he did meet with a Russian attorney, but it was about adoptions. After that, he said he did meet with her, but it was because he was told she had dirt on Hillary. He said the meeting was a fruitless endeavor.Now he says it s because he wanted to determine her fitness for the presidency, which he seems to think makes it all okay. Coons is right to be skeptical. It would be one thing if the junior Trump s story had never changed, and contradicting information had never come out. But it s impossible to trust the testimony of someone who s changed their story as many times as he has.Featured image via John Moore/Getty Images",Fake

Thank you very much. Thank you. I actually saw great potential right across the street to be honest with you,  Trump began.  And it was only for the reason that the United Nations was here that that turned out to be such a successful project. So, I want to thank you, Ambassador Haley for your introduction and your steadfast advocacy for American interests on the world stage. Here s the video via Twitter.Pres. Trump on luxury residential property by UN: United Nations being there was reason  that turned out to be such a successful project.  pic.twitter.com/kid9STah3W  ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) September 18, 2017So, Trump can t even stop being a narcissist for one day to address the distinguished diplomats and representatives of the United Nations.It should be noted that New Yorkers strongly opposed the construction of Trump World Tower in the late 1990s, including legendary journalist Walter Cronkite.Basically, Trump robbed the neighborhood of their view of the East River and Long Island by placing a big ugly tower in front of it so that only wealthy people staying in his building could enjoy it. Residents were also concerned that the big ugly building would dwarf the more aesthetically pleasing United Nations Headquarters, which it did.Trump is nothing more than a cheap salesman who is more interested in touting his real estate ventures than he is in promoting international peace and cooperation. That s incredibly sad.Once again, Trump embarrassed himself and America on the world stage. And those were just his opening remarks. Just imagine how much more he will embarrass our country before he is done speaking. The United States is going to be an even bigger joke on the international stage than we have ever been.Featured Image: Screenshot",Fake
" FBI Clears Michael Flynn Of Wrongdoing As Trump Lets Comey Keep His Job On Tuesday, it was announced that Donald Trump has elected to keep James Comey (that nice gentleman who helped swing the election in Trump s favor by sending Republicans a letter falsely indicating that a new investigation into Hillary Clinton was being opened just before the election) as FBI Director. That s a move The New York Times notes will  keep Mr. Comey at the center of the F.B.I. s investigation into several Trump associates and their potential ties with the Russian government. Comey demonstrated with his attacks on Hillary that he has absolutely no integrity whatsoever, which makes him exactly the sort of guy Trump would want to keep around. Also on Tuesday, purely by coincidence of course, news broke that Trump s national security adviser was cleared of any wrongdoing in his frantic communications with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak on the same day President Obama announced sanctions against Russia for their cyberattack on our nation during the election.White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, who also says that Trump had the most heavily-witnessed inauguration in history, and for whom Kellyanne Conway created a new term,  alternative facts,  in an effort to normalize his lies, explained Monday that the two aren t in frequent contact but have spoken recently on a number of issues that were completely innocent, like logistics for a post-inauguration call between Trump and his Russian dictator friend who 17 intelligence agencies say directly interfered with our election on The Donald s behalf.The problem here is that Americans cannot be sure if the presented results are legitimate, as the FBI is headed by someone who went out of his way, breaking precedent and probably the law, to aid Trump in the election with misleading information about Clinton. This same man was just rewarded for his actions when Trump allowed him to keep his job. But Trump also has the power to fire him if he isn t satisfied with the results of any of the numerous investigations into his team.In November, Trump said that Comey  made a mistake  when he announced that Hillary Clinton had committed no crimes and would not be charged, but  brought back his reputation  when he released the letter that gave right-wing propaganda outlets (and Putin s team of propagandists) much-needed ammo just before the election.So now, we as Americans are presented with a dilemma: Do we accept the words of the FBI, knowing that Trump can fire the person in charge of the investigations, when he is someone who has shown a corrupt desire to interfere in important things like elections in the past? Or do we demand a full release of investigatory documents and transcripts just to be sure the truth is being told?Probably better to be safe about this.Featured image by Andrew Harrer via Getty Images ",Fake
"Republican push to end Obamacare collapses in Senate WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican efforts to overhaul or repeal Obamacare collapsed in the U.S. Senate on Tuesday, dealing a sharp setback to President Donald Trump and the Republican Partyâ€™s seven-year quest to kill former President Barack Obamaâ€™s signature healthcare law. The disarray in the Republican-controlled Senate rattled financial markets as it cast doubt on the chances of getting Trumpâ€™s other domestic policy priorities, such as tax reform, through a divided Congress. Trump said he was disappointed by the failure and suggested he might let the insurance markets created under Obamacare go under and then, potentially, work with Democrats on a rescue. â€œWeâ€™re probably in that position where weâ€™ll just let Obamacare fail,â€ Trump told reporters at the White House. â€œWe will let Obamacare fail, and then the Democrats are going to come to us.â€ U.S. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell announced a vote on a straight repeal of Obamacare, which would take effect in two years, after it became clear on Monday night that he did not have enough support to pass an overhaul of the healthcare law. He said on Tuesday that the vote would take place â€œearly next week.â€ But prospects for the repeal vote appeared doomed with at least three Republican senators voicing opposition. Moderate Republican Senators Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska quickly announced they would not back repeal. With Democrats united in opposition, Republicans can only afford to lose two votes to pass the measure in the Senate, where they have a slim 52-48 majority. â€œI do not think that itâ€™s going to be constructive to repeal a law that at this point is so interwoven within our healthcare system and then hope that over the next two years we will come up with some kind of replacement,â€ Collins told reporters. The failed effort to replace Obamacare raised new concerns for U.S. health insurers over whether the government would continue to fund billionsÂ of dollars in medical benefit subsidies. Obamacare has boosted the number of Americans with health insurance through mandates on individuals and employers, and income-based subsidies. About 20 million Americans gained insurance coverage through the law. â€œThis has been a very, very challenging experience for all of us,â€ McConnell said, adding that the chamber needed to move on to issues like tax reform and a spending package to bolster the countryâ€™s infrastructure. As the healthcare bill collapsed in the Senate, leaders in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives unveiled a budget plan putting a proposed tax code overhaul on the same partisan procedural path that led to the anti-Obamacare initiativeâ€™s chaotic downfall. Republicans had hoped to finish with healthcare before an upcoming August recess so they could tackle a wide-ranging rewrite of the U.S. tax code in September. Separate talks on taxes appear unlikely to reach Trumpâ€™s pledge to reduce the corporate tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent.     But their failure exposed the sharp divide within Republicansâ€™ own ranks, with moderates concerned the healthcare billâ€™s Medicaid cuts would take insurance away from millions of low-income Americans while conservatives backed the cuts and wanted even more dramatic changes to Obamacare. The U.S. dollar stumbled to a 10-month low against a basket of currencies and U.S. Treasury yields fell after the fresh setback to the healthcare bill raised investorsâ€™ doubts about Trumpâ€™s ability to enact tax cuts and infrastructure spending. Reaction in the stock market was muted, and analysts said the expectation for business-friendly legislation out of Washington is all but priced out of the stock market. â€œThe healthcare hurdle pushes everything in Trumpâ€™s agenda to 2018,â€ said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.  Trump vowed that the healthcare effort was not dead. In an early morning Twitter message, he said, â€œWe were let down by all of the Democrats and a few Republicans. Most Republicans were loyal, terrific & worked really hard. We will return!â€ Trump had pushed hard to get a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare through the U.S. House of Representatives in May and celebrated the victory with lawmakers on the White House lawn. But with polls showing the Republican bill was unpopular, he later called it â€œmeanâ€ and did little to convince Republican senators to get a deal. Vice President Mike Pence said Trump supported the move to vote on a straight repeal of Obamacare. â€œInaction is not an option,â€ Pence said at the National Retail Federation Conference in Washington. â€œCongress needs to step up, Congress needs to do their job, and Congress needs to do their job now.â€ In crafting a replacement, Republicans ran up against Obamacareâ€™s growing popularity. A Washington Post-ABC News poll published on Sunday showed Americans preferred it over the Republican alternative by a 2-1 margin.   Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer urged Republicans to start over and work with Democrats. Democratic Senator Patty Murray, the leading Democrat on the Senate health committee, said in an interview with Reuters that a bipartisan effort could help stabilize insurance markets. She said a bipartisan effort to fund cost-sharing subsidies that help cover premiums, deductibles and other medical expenses for about 7 million people who purchase health insurance on the individual market would â€œsend a strong message to the marketâ€ and â€œcreate some stabilization that is much needed.â€ Within hours of the billâ€™s failure, Republican Senate Health Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander said he will set hearings in the next few weeks on how to stabilize the individual insurance markets. Orrin Hatch, the Republican chair of the Senate Finance Committee, said on the Senate floor that the failure could mean Congress will have to bail out insurance markets â€œprobably before the end of 2017.â€ For hospitals, shelving the bill relieves the near-term pressure of massive Medicaid reform, but the long-term plan for federal spending for statesâ€™ Medicaid expansion is now murky.

" Team Trump Canâ€™t Get Their Immigration Message Straight, So Hillary Does It For Them Donald Trump s signature issue since he began his travesty of a presidential campaign has been immigration. He won the primary by promising a bunch of ignorant, anti-immigrant, racist, and otherwise bigoted voters in the GOP base that he d deport all the brown people and build a giant wall to keep more of them from coming in. Well, that was the primary, and this is general election. He and his campaign staff seem to have realized that they can t win with just a bunch of racists, so they are attempting to moderate that hardline message, but they have to be careful, because the base still has to be fed that red meat that got them onto Team Trump in the first place.The result of this attempted balancing act has been a muddying of the water amongst Trump s campaign staff and surrogates as they chase their tails all over television with no clear message regarding what will happen to all of the undocumented immigrants who are already here and contributing to American society. In fact, on Sunday s edition of MSNBC s Meet the Press, this was a topic of conversation, and one panel member pretty much summed up the issue here: Trump himself doesn t know what the hell his own plan is on his signature issue. I don t know if Donald Trump knows what he is going to do with them [illegal immigrants]   @TheFix on #MTP Panel  Meet the Press (@MeetThePress) September 4, 2016Moderator Chuck Todd also interviewed Trump s running mate Mike Pence, and his answers weren t anymore satisfying. Pence only returned to the false narrative that Trump s positions on this issue are  consistent. Pence on #MTP: ""I think Donald Trump has been completely consistent"" on deportation policy.https://t.co/Q3m39LDyQy  Meet the Press (@MeetThePress) September 4, 2016Well, since the American people deserve to know where a major party presidential candidate stands on such an important issue this far along in the election season, Hillary s campaign manager Robby Mook decided to help us all out. He released a statement via the Hillary For America website that reads: Donald Trump has stated very clearly throughout his campaign that he will deport everyone who is undocumented, something that was reinforced in his speech in Arizona last Wednesday. Beyond forcibly removing every single undocumented person from this country, Trump has also promised to rescind DACA and DAPA, and deport American citizens who are born to undocumented immigrant parents. What we saw today is Mike Pence and Trump s top campaign officials attempt to mislead voters about their mass deportation policy by using soft words to describe harsh tactics   one of the oldest tricks in the book. Immigrant families know the meanings of  humane  and  fair  and can see straight through their cynical ploys. Trump s message to immigrant families is clear: everyone must go. This, of course, is the bottom line: the Trump campaign wishes to muddy the waters, to make us all think he doesn t plan on erecting a deportation force to make all the brown people leave, so that we ll think he actually has some compassion for these people. Nothing could be further from the truth. It doesn t matter to Trump if you re a 70-year-old woman who fled her home country 40 years ago to escape war or violence, if it was either enter the country illegally or face certain death   Trump will deport you, and take you away from your documented children and grandchildren.That s the kind of cold, cruel, callous approach that Donald Trump and his racist cronies have when it comes to this very complex and sensitive issue, make no mistake. They re just using different words now, but they mean exactly what has been said for the last 14 months   immigrants are the enemy, and they will be thrown out.Thankfully, though, Hillary and her team have read the message loud and clear, and are making sure the American people understand just what that very scary message is.Featured image via Instagram",Fake
"Trump's Virginia comments last straw for disenchanted CEOs NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Several U.S. chief executives had been considering resigning from Donald Trumpâ€™s business advisory councils for months after the president said he would pull out of the Paris climate accord and ban transgender people from the military, sources told Reuters on Wednesday, long before Trumpâ€™s comments on racial violence this week pushed them over the edge. Trump disbanded two high-profile advisory groups on Wednesday, after the head of his Strategic and Policy Forum advised the White House the group was breaking up, and a trickle of departures from his American Manufacturing Council threatened to become a mass exodus. â€œHe was at 95 percent already,â€ a source close to Larry Fink, head of investment firm BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), said of Finkâ€™s leaning toward resigning from the Strategic and Policy Forum.  â€œI think that (Trumpâ€™s latest comments) just made it 120 percent.â€  A number of CEOs started to consider more seriously whether to disband after Trumpâ€™s initial remarks blaming violence at Saturdayâ€™s white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, on â€œmany sides,â€ which was taken to include not only white nationalists but also anti-racism activists who opposed them. Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) CEO Kenneth Frazier, an African-American, was the first to leave the manufacturing council on Monday over Trumpâ€™s weekend reaction.   Trump then attacked Frazier on Twitter, prompting other CEOs to consider quitting also. Frazierâ€™s resignation was followed by the CEOs of Under Armour Inc (UAA.N) and Intel Corp (INTC.O) later on Monday. Trumpâ€™s fiery comments on Tuesday, doubling down on his initial response to the Virginia rally, unnerved CEOs already doubting the utility and public relations value of remaining on Trumpâ€™s councils, sources close to several of the CEOs told Reuters.  Soon after Trumpâ€™s comments on Tuesday, JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) CEO Jamie Dimon, who serves on the Strategic and Policy Forum, started pushing for the forum to take some kind of action, a person close to him said. Dimon had previously expressed exasperation with politics in Washington, saying in July that it is â€œalmost an embarrassment being an American citizen traveling around the world.â€ Sensing a breakdown in the group, Stephen Schwarzman, CEO of money manager Blackstone Group (BX.N) and chairman of the Strategic and Policy Forum, convened a call on Wednesday for its members. After some debate, â€œthe momentum was such that there wasnâ€™t much room for dissent,â€ said one source familiar with the discussion.  The decision to disband was agreed and Schwarzman called the White House to inform the president, the source said. Shortly after, Trump tweeted that he was disbanding the two groups.  The leader of the manufacturing council, Dow Chemical Co DOW.N CEO Andrew Liveris, had planned a call with remaining members to try to salvage the group on Wednesday, according to an email seen by Reuters. The call never took place, superseded by Trumpâ€™s dissolution of the group.     Sources familiar with the discussions of the boards of Merck and Intel said that they backed their CEOsâ€™ decisions to leave because they did not believe stepping down from Trumpâ€™s councils would have a negative impact on their businesses.  â€œI donâ€™t think these are personal decisions,â€ said Blain Rethmeier, a Republican strategist who worked on the Trump transition and consults with companies in California. â€œI think these are made through the eyes of whatâ€™s in the best interest of the company, and the brand risks of what it means to be involved with the council became too much.â€ ",Real
"FCC media rule rollback could usher in TV station buying spree WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican-led Federal Communications Commission is moving  to quickly undo roadblocks to increased consolidation among media companies, potentially unleashing an onslaught of deals among TV, radio and newspaper owners as they seek to better compete with online media. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai on Wednesday disclosed his plans to ask the media and communications regulator on Nov. 16 to eliminate the 42-year-old ban on cross-ownership of a newspaper and TV station in a major market.  The changes would also make it easier for media companies to buy additional TV stations in the same market, or for local stations to jointly sell advertising time. The move, along with other expected FCC media rule changes, could usher in a new era of media consolidation that could help struggling newspapers and TV stations, but limit the diversity of media voices. FCCâ€™s Pai has cited rising competition for advertising from websites like Alphabet Incâ€™s Google and Facebook Inc as a reason for easing the media ownership rules as well as helping struggling newspapers. Big media firms including Tegna Inc and Nexstar Media Group Inc, have cited the potential rule change as motivating them to look for expansion opportunities. In the near future, the decision could also allow Sinclair Broadcast Groupâ€™s, which is seeking approval for its proposed $3.9 billion acquisition of Tribune Media Co, to avoid some divestitures in order to get the deal approved. Eliminating â€œoutdated regulations that unnecessarily hobble local broadcast stations will benefit consumers in communities across the country,â€ said the National Association of Broadcasters Friday. Advocacy group Free Press criticized Paiâ€™s proposal, saying it â€œignores how decades of runaway media consolidation have significantly harmed local news and independent voices.â€ Anne Bentley, a spokeswoman for Tegna, a TV broadcaster formerly known as Gannett before it spun off the newspapers in 2015, said the company â€œexpects to be a strategic and disciplined consolidator at this pivotal time of positive regulatory change.â€ Nexstar Chief Executive Officer Perry Sook said in a statement Thursday the changes would allow local broadcasters to â€œmake additional investments in localized programming content, our people, news resources and reporting capabilities.â€ Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics, told Reuters the rollback of the rules means â€œwe will see more consolidation on the local level, where TV stations or TV groups will buy local newspapers.â€ CBS Corp Chief Executive Les Moonves said in February he believed Paiâ€™s deregulatory plans â€œwill be very beneficial to our business.â€ With rule changes, CBS â€œwould strategically want to buy some more.â€ In April, the FCC voted to reverse a 2016 decision that limits the number of television stations some broadcasters could buy. Under rules adopted in 1985, stations with weaker over-the-air signals could be partially counted against a broadcasterâ€™s ownership cap. But last year, the FCC under Democratic President Barack Obama said those rules were outdated after the 2009 conversion to digital broadcasting, which eliminated the differences in station signal strength. Pai said in late March that he also planned to take a new look at the current overall limit on companies owning stations serving no more than 39 percent of U.S. television households. ",Real
"Tillerson urges Iraq, Kurds to resolve conflict through dialogue BAGHDAD (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson urged the Iraqi government and the Kurdistan region on Monday to resolve their conflict over Kurdish self-determination and disputed territories through dialogue. Tillerson laid out his position at the start of a meeting in Baghdad with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who in turn defended the role of an Iraqi paramilitary force backed by Iran against criticism the secretary of state made on Sunday. â€œWe are concerned and a bit sad,â€ Tillerson said in his opening remarks. â€œWe have friends in Baghdad and friends in Erbil and we encourage all parties to enter into discussion ... and all differences can be addressed,â€ he said, referring to the Iraqi and Kurdistan region capitals. The U.S. administration sided with Abadi in rejecting the validity of the referendum held last month in the Kurdish region, which produced an overwhelming yes for Kurdish independence. The administration also called on the two sides to avoid further escalation, after Abadi retaliated against the vote by isolating the Kurdistan region and ordering his troops to seize the oil city of Kirkuk from Kurdish fighters. â€œWe donâ€™t want to enter into any battle against any Iraqi component,â€ Abadi said. â€œWhen we entered Kirkuk we sent a clear message that the citizens of Kirkuk are important to us.â€      It was Tillersonâ€™s second meeting with Abadi in as many days. After Sundayâ€™s meeting, alongside Saudi Arabiaâ€™s King Salman, Tillerson said it was time for Iranian-backed militias that had helped Baghdad defeat Islamic State to â€œgo homeâ€.  Abadi told Tillerson the paramilitary force called Popular Mobilisation â€œis part of the Iraqi institutions,â€ rejecting accusations that it is acting as Iranâ€™s proxies. â€œPopular Mobilisation fighters should be encouraged because they will be the hope of country and the region,â€ he said. A few hours earlier, Abadiâ€™s office published a statement rejecting Tillersonâ€™s comments. â€œNo party has the right to interfere in Iraqi matters,â€ it said [nL8N1MY1UJ]. Washington, which also backed Baghdad against Islamic State, is concerned Iran will use its increased presence in Iraq, and in Syria where it supports President Bashar al-Assad, to expand its influence in the region. Shiâ€™ite Muslim Iranâ€™s influence in Iraq, where the population is also predominantly Shiâ€™ite, has grown since the U.S. invasion of 2003 that overthrew dictator Saddam Hussein, a Sunni.  Iraqâ€™s Sunni Muslim neighbours, including Saudi Arabia, share Washingtonâ€™s concern about rising Iranian influence. Tehran has trained and armed the Iraqi Popular Mobilisation forces that have fought, often alongside Iraqi government units, against Islamic State, which was effectively defeated in July when a U.S.-backed offensive captured its stronghold, Mosul. The United States has over 5,000 troops deployed in Iraq and provided critical air and ground support in the offensive on Islamic State. It is also the main backer of the Kurdish-led Syrian coalition that captured the IS stronghold of Raqqa earlier this month. Of the closest groups to Iran within Popular Mobilisation, Asaib Ahl al-Haq, reacted to Tillersonâ€™s comment by saying it would be the Americans who will be forced to leave Iraq. â€œYour forces should get ready to get out of our country once the excuse of Daeshâ€™s presence is over,â€ said Asaibâ€™s leader, Sheikh Qais al-Khazali, according to the groupâ€™s TV channel, al-Aahd.

"Trump high court pick Gorsuch shows conservative credentials WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In less than three months, President Donald Trumpâ€™s nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court, Justice Neil Gorsuch, is already staking out ground on the courtâ€™s right, adding his voice to the biggest controversies including Trumpâ€™s travel ban targeted at six Muslim-majority countries, gun control, religious rights and gay rights. In a flurry of activity at the court on Monday, Gorsuch showed his inclination to rule from a spot occupied by fellow conservative Justice Clarence Thomas. At a minimum, he is so far living up to Trumpâ€™s claim that he would be a conservative in the mold of the man he replaced, Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last year. Thomas, appointed by President George H.W. Bush in 1991, is seen by legal experts as the most conservative of the nine justices and is known for his idiosyncratic views of some legal issues. The court has a 5-4 conservative majority. Two of the conservative majority, Anthony Kennedy, and to a lesser extent Chief Justice John Roberts, sometimes side with the liberals. Liberal groups and Democratic senators had vociferously opposed Gorsuchâ€™s appointment, with the evidence so far suggesting their depiction of him as a dogged conservative was largely correct. â€œJustice Gorsuch has shown himself to be the conservative ideologue many predicted he would be and not the moderating check on the executive branch as others suggested he would be,â€ said Michele Jawando, a lawyer with the liberal Center for American Progress. Conservatives, meanwhile, are delighted. Their hope that Gorsuch, 49, would be a solid vote on the right, would appear to be well founded. â€œGorsuch is rapidly becoming my favorite justice,â€ said Ilya Shapiro, a lawyer with the libertarian Cato Institute. The new justice, formerly an appeals court judge in Colorado, was sworn in on April 10 after Democrats made a concerted effort to block his confirmation by the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate. Gorsuch has not been shy to make his voice heard since day one on the bench when, during three one-hour arguments, he sparred with attorneys no fewer than eight times. â€œIâ€™m sorry for taking up so much time, I apologize,â€ he said, smiling, after one such lengthy exchange. Gorsuch has asserted himself on paper as well. His one opinion for the court, in a case about debt collection, was unanimous. But itâ€™s not unusual for new justices to be assigned a first opinion to write where the court is in broad agreement. In the cases where the court has been divided, he has reliably stuck with the conservative wing while showing something of an independent streak similar to Thomas. Gorusch nailed his colors to the mast in a series of written opinions and votes on Monday. In the biggest dispute before the justices, the court handed a partial win to Trump by partly reviving his travel ban that he has said is needed for security reasons but opponents criticize as discriminatory. The ban was blocked by lower courts and the high court agreed to hear oral arguments in its next term starting in October. Gorsuch, with two of the courtâ€™s other conservatives, said they would have voted to allow the entire ban to go into effect. When the court also declined to hear what would have been a major gun rights case on whether the constitutional right to keep firearms for self-defense extends outside the home, only two of the nine justices dissented. One was Thomas. The other was Gorsuch. A gay rights case saw a similar pattern, with Thomas, Gorsuch and fellow conservative Samuel Alito the only dissenters as the court threw out an Arkansas court ruling that allowed the state to refuse to list both same-sex spouses on birth certificates. Gorsuch has also showed a willingness to quibble with his colleagues on what might seem minor points. In the courtâ€™s big ruling on Monday in a religious rights case, the justices were split 7-2 on allowing a church to apply for state funding to re-pave its school playground. Gorsuch wrote a separate concurring opinion, joined by Thomas, in which he explained in part why he agreed with all of the majority opinion, except for one footnote that limited it. â€œIt could be that he is more similar to Thomas than Scalia. If he continues this pattern it might be significant,â€ said Ilya Somin, a libertarian law professor at George Mason University. ",Real
"Factbox: Who are Britain First, whose leader's posts Trump re-tweeted? LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has re-tweeted anti-Islam videos originally posted by Jayda Fransen, a leader of a far-right British party convicted earlier in November of abusing a Muslim woman.  Fransen is deputy leader of the anti-immigrant Britain First group. Here are some details about her organization:  Britain First was founded in 2011 by leader Paul Golding with a membership of three individuals. It describes itself as a â€œpatriotic political party and street movementâ€, although critics denounce it as a far-right, racist organization. â€œBritain First is committed to preserving our ancestral ethnic and cultural heritage, traditions, customs and values,â€ it says on its website.   It wants to deport all illegal immigrants, halt all further immigration, and introduce â€œa comprehensive ban on the religion of Islamâ€ with headscarves being outlawed in public. â€œAnyone found to be promoting the ideology of Islam will be subject to deportation or imprisonment,â€ its policy platform states.   It holds protests across the country, usually attended by a couple of hundred supporters at most, many of whom hold white crosses because the group argues Christianity in Britain is being threatened by immigration and the growth of militant Islam.  Golding was a former senior figure in the far-right British National Party and was elected a local councillor in 2009. In his biography on the groupâ€™s website it says he was â€œsent to prison in 2016 for confronting a Muslim hate preacher who was secretly recorded saying itâ€™s okay for Muslims to keep sex slavesâ€.  Golding stood for election as London mayor in May 2016, winning 31,372 votes, 1.2 percent of all cast.  Fransen, who was elected deputy leader in 2014, was convicted of religiously aggravated harassment in November 2017, and both she and Golding are facing further similar charges.   The group gained prominence in June 2016 when Labour lawmaker Jo Cox was shot dead on the street by a Nazi-obsessed loner who witnesses said had been shouting â€œBritain firstâ€ during the attack. Fransen told Reuters the killer had nothing to do with her group.  ",Real
"Exclusive: White House weighs tightening U.S. food aid shipping rules - sources WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trumpâ€™s administration is preparing an executive order that will require all U.S. food aid to be transported on American ships, according to four sources with knowledge of the deliberations. Currently, 50 percent of such aid must be transported on U.S.-flagged vessels. The sources said Trump is considering going as far as doubling that to 100 percent, a move likely to stir opposition from both Republicans and Democrats. â€œAn executive order is being drafted by the White House,â€ one source with knowledge of discussions told Reuters, adding that it was being discussed among government lawyers. Although unlikely to have any significant effect on the $4 trillion global cargo shipping industry, the initiative touted as part of Trumpâ€™s â€œAmerica Firstâ€ platform may slow food aid getting to millions of people and do little to create jobs, critics said.  Aid groups, and members of Congress from both parties have been working for years to lower, or eliminate, the 50 percent shipping requirement. The United States, the worldâ€™s largest provider of humanitarian assistance, spent about $2.8 billion on foreign food aid in 2016. About half of that is estimated to go to shipping and storage. The conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute said in a November report that shipping food aid on U.S.-flagged vessels costs 46 percent more than aid shipped at internationally competitive rates and can take as much as 14 weeks longer.     Supporters say Trumpâ€™s initiative would not only create new U.S. jobs in the shipping industry but that U.S.-controlled food shipments are important for national security because the U.S. fleet could be transferred to the military in case of a conflict. Critics argue the order would create few, if any, jobs. Food aid is a very small percentage of the worldwide sea cargo flow, while the security issue is moot as most cargo ships are too slow for use by the 21st century military.   The costs would also be far higher by eliminating competition for shipping contracts with lower-cost international carriers, requiring more U.S. taxpayer dollars to feed fewer people, they say. A spokesman for USAID, which oversees U.S. humanitarian programs, declined to comment, referring the question to the White House.  Natalie Strom, a spokeswoman for the White House said, â€œWe donâ€™t comment on any potential EOâ€™s (executive orders) that may or may not be in the works.â€ Trump has submitted a budget outline that proposed steep cuts in spending on foreign aid, which accounts for just 1 percent of all U.S. spending. Members of Congress from both parties said they opposed that plan. With the world facing four potential famines, and struggles to care for millions displaced by conflicts in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, critics have been pushing to eliminate what they see as an unnecessary regulation that already adds $50 million a year to the cost of providing aid. Tom Hart, North America executive director at The One Campaign, a non-profit group co-founded by U2â€™s Bono to fight poverty, said the regulation would hinder getting life-saving food assistance to the people Americans are trying to help. Â Â Â  â€œMillions of people could be denied the food aid they need to survive if the cargo preference requirement is doubled,â€ said Hart. Senator Bob Corker, the influential Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has been an especially vocal critic of the shipping requirement. He and another committee member, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, have filed legislation to ease the requirement.  After hearing about the potential order, senators from both parties called senior administration officials to let them know this would not be supported in Congress, a Senate aide told Reuters. â€œTheyâ€™ve been warned,â€ the aide added.

" Geraldo Rivera To San Juan Mayor Carmen YulÃ­n Cruz: â€˜I Donâ€™t See People Dyingâ€™ (VIDEO) The way in which Donald Trump has handled the aftermath of Hurricane Maria s impact on Puerto Rico, an unincorporated territory of the United States, has been nothing short of terrible and incompetent, leading many to question his ability to even locate Puerto Rico on a map. The only thing more disgusting than the actions of President Trump is the behavior of his blind followers and Fox News reporter and former talk show host Geraldo Rivera set the bar relatively low recently.San Juan Mayor Carmen Yul n Cruz reached out to Trump first by pleading in an interview for him to  save us from dying,  but to no avail. Cruz then tried in the only way proven effective, by taking to Twitter almost a week after Hurricane Maria, the strongest hurricane to make landfall in Puerto Rico since 1928, struck the country and left most of the population without power or fresh water.

Cruz s tweet read in Spanish,  Mr. President, not to eliminate the laws of cabotage is immoral. It is an act of financial oppression that will only aggravate our crisis.  It is almost certain that Trump can t read Spanish or comprehend the fact that Cabotage is a real term to refer to coastal navigation and trade, so naturally, he saw this as an insult:The Mayor of San Juan, who was very complimentary only a few days ago, has now been told by the Democrats that you must be nasty to Trump.

There are all people at all municipalities literally starving, dehydrating,  Cruz told Rivera.  We have had our hospital try to go back to speed but then the electricity goes off and we have to do all the bacteria testing, which takes three to four days. Geraldo wasn t convinced and felt the need to interject. But are people dying?  he interrupted.  I ve been traveling around, I don t see people dying. I spoke to the doctors, they say they saw 53 patients and they had a person who was septic, but nobody dying. Mayor Cruz tried her best to reason with the mustachioed one. Dying is a continuum,  she explained.  If you don t get fed for seven, eight days and you re a child, you are dying. If you have 11 people   like we took out of a nursing home   severely dehydrated, you are dying. Watch the madness unfold below and, in case you were wondering, the death toll in Puerto Rico due to Hurricane Maria stood at 16 as of Sunday with only nine hospitals connected to the electric grid.Featured image via screenshot",Fake
" Hawaii Attorney General HUMILIATES Jeff Sessions For Whining About Judge On â€˜Island In The Pacificâ€™ Donald Trump s Attorney General just got schooled on the Constitution.Earlier this week, Jeff Sessions bitched about a judge  on an island in the Pacific  having the power to block an executive order. I really am amazed that a judge sitting on an island in the Pacific can issue an order that stops the President of the United States from what appears to be clearly his statutory and constitutional power,  Sessions said.Of course, Sessions is a hypocrite because he cheered on judges who blocked executive orders issued by President Obama.But because the order was issued by his rich white boss, Sessions is all of a sudden complaining.Judge Derrick Watson stood up to Trump and his racist administration a couple months ago by blocking parts of the immigration ban that barred Muslims from certain nations from entering the country. Trump s ban caused international chaos and violated the civil rights of thousands.Hawaii is not merely an  island in the Pacific,  however. It s also an official state under the same Constitution that Jeff Sessions and Donald Trump violate on a daily basis.In the Constitution, the founding fathers created the Judicial Branch of our government to serve as a check on executive and legislative power. The judiciary has the power to review executive orders and laws and can block and strike them down if they are found to be unconstitutional.Judge Watson exercised his judicial power.Sessions  statement is a disgraceful attempt to undermine the judicial branch.Hawaii Attorney General Dougal Chin fired back at Sessions on Thursday by explaining how the Constitution works. President Trump previously called a federal judge in California a so-called judge. Now U.S. Attorney General Sessions appears to dismiss a federal judge in Hawaii as just a judge sitting on an island in the Pacific. Our Constitution created a separation of powers in the United States for a reason. Our federal courts, established under Article III of the Constitution, are co-equal partners with Congress and the President. It is disappointing Sessions does not acknowledge that. Indeed, America needs an Attorney General who actually understands the Constitution, and Sessions clearly does not.One of Sessions  Justice Department lackeys even tried to pathetically clarify the offensive remarks. Hawaii is, in fact, an island in the Pacific a beautiful one where the Attorney General s granddaughter was born. The point, however, is that there is a problem when a flawed opinion by a single judge can block the President s lawful exercise of authority to keep the entire country safe. Wrong. If Trump and his administration think the ruling is flawed then they should seek opinions from higher courts. That s how the system works. The White House and Justice Department can t just ignore a court ruling because they disagree with it. Also, national security should not be used as an excuse to ignore the Constitution. That s a slippery slope to tyranny. If that excuse were acceptable Trump and Sessions would use it all the time to justify anything and everything they do.Jeff Sessions should be embarrassed for attacking the judicial branch the way he did and he definitely deserved the humiliation he has been receiving. Frankly, he should resign in disgrace.Featured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",Fake
"Senators propose legislation to protect special counsel from Trump WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican and Democratic senators introduced two pieces of legislation on Thursday seeking to block President Donald Trump from firing the special counsel probing his ties to Russia, as Congress increasingly seeks to assert its authority on policy. Members of Congress from both parties have expressed concern that Trump might dismiss Robert Mueller, the special counsel appointed to determine whether there was collusion between his 2016 presidential campaign and Moscow. The Republican president on May 9 fired FBI Director James Comey, who was overseeing the investigation. He also recently criticized his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, for recusing himself from the probe. With signs that Muellerâ€™s investigation is intensifying, members of Congress sought to protect the special counsel, who was appointed on May 17. Two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday that Mueller had convened a grand jury in Washington to investigate the allegations of Russian meddling. The sources added that grand jury subpoenas had been issued in connection with a June 2016 meeting involving Trumpâ€™s son, his son-in-law and a Russian lawyer. Moscow has denied any effort to influence the election, and Trump has disputed any allegations of collusion between his associates and Russia. â€œOur bill allows judicial review of any decision to terminate a counsel to make sure itâ€™s done for the reasons cited in the regulations rather than political motivation,â€ said Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who co-sponsored one of the bills with Democratic Senator Cory Booker. A second, generally similar, measure was introduced by Republican Senator Thom Tillis and Democratic Senator Chris Coons. Coons told reporters that he expected the two groups of senators would work together and seek more co-sponsors from both parties, to come up with a single bill. He said they were in discussions with the leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee in the hope they would take up the bill, a step toward a vote in the full Senate. The measures were introduced as the Senate prepared to leave Washington for its August recess. Lawmakers will return in early September. Members of Congress, including some of Trumpâ€™s fellow Republicans, have recently been pursuing legislation seeking to increase Congressâ€™ influence on U.S. policy. Last week, lawmakers voted almost unanimously for a sweeping sanctions bill that gave Congress the right to review any Trump effort to ease or lift sanctions on Russia. Trump signed that bill into law on Wednesday. ",Real

"Trump tax plan may produce some short-term budget issues: Mnuchin WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Saturday that the Trump administrationâ€™s tax reform plan would produce some â€œshort term issuesâ€ when viewed under traditional â€œstaticâ€ budget analysis rules. His comments during an interview by International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde suggested that the plan would not be revenue-neutral and would increase deficits in the short term. Mnuchin said that the tax plan would pay for itself when viewed through a â€œdynamic scoringâ€ analysis, which accounts for the increased tax revenues that would be produced by higher growth prompted by the tax changes. â€œWeâ€™re looking for reforms that will pay for themselves with growth,â€ Mnuchin said. â€œUnder dynamic scoring, this will pay for itself, under static scoring, thereâ€™ll be short term issues.â€ Mnuchin also said the tax plan would be aimed at helping the middle class to â€œget more money in their pocketsâ€ and would be much simpler. â€œThe tax code is way, way, way too complicated. We want to create a system where the average American can file a tax code on a big postcard,â€ Mnuchin said. ",Real

"Kremlin: U.S. arms supplies to Ukraine would set back peace efforts MOSCOW (Reuters) - Any U.S. decision to supply Ukraine with lethal weapons would set back peace efforts and escalate tensions, the Kremlin said on Tuesday. The Kremlin was referring to an interview given by U.S. special envoy on Ukraine, Kurt Volker, to Britainâ€™s broadcaster BBC, in which he said that Washington was actively reviewing whether to send weapons to help those fighting against Russian-backed rebels. The Kremlin said a possible delivery of U.S. weapons to Ukraine could destabilize the situation along the frontline in the east of the country. â€œWe have already said more than once that any action which escalates tension ... and further aggravates the already complicated situation will only move us further and further away  from the moment of settling this internal issue of Ukraine,â€ Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a conference call with reporters.

" Snowflake Trump Makes His Staff Create A Daily Newsletter A couple of weeks ago, Donald Trump held his first cabinet meeting. They might have discussed policy or the goals of the floundering administration, but what the world saw was like something straight out of North Korea. Trump went around the room and each cabinet member heaped fawning praise on Dear Leader.It turns out that was far from an isolated incident. Trump s White House has a daily newsletter and its one and only purpose is to appease Dear Leader s fragile snowflake ego.There is already a White House newsletter called  1600 Daily  after the White House address of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. It s already an upbeat, full of pictures and general public relations (and yes, propaganda) stories, online newsletter that s available to the general public.West Wing Reads, though, is different. It wasn t written by staff. Instead, it s a compilation of stories from the web   mostly from right-wing sources such as Breitbart and Fox   that are flattering to Trump.On Thursday, for example, a Forbes contributor argued the Congressional Budget Office was wrong in calculating that 22 million people would lose health insurance under Trumpcare. According to them, no one would lose insurance.Reality check! An analysis by Forbes contributor Josh Archambault reveals surprising flaws in the CBO s score of the Senate healthcare bill, which concludes 22 million more Americans will be without health coverage by 2026. As Archambault points out, the CBO score is based on an old, inaccurate 2016 CBO estimate of how many Americans will purchase Obamacare. If you use their January 2017 update, Republican legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare would result in only 2 million fewer on the individual market by 2026, and would actually result in no losses and even some gains in enrollment in the years preceding, Archambault estimates.

"Liberal, conservative lawmakers offer opposing U.S. healthcare ideas WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. senators unveiled two opposing visions of a healthcare  system in the United States on Wednesday - leading liberals advocating government insurance for all and several Republicans proposing an eleventh-hour repeal of Obamacare to replace it with programs run by the states. Neither plan was thought likely to succeed in a Congress exhausted with fighting over the issue, raising questions over whether lawmakers would instead prop up the health benefits offered under former President Barack Obamaâ€™s healthcare law. Independent Senator Bernie Sanders, a 2016 Democratic Party presidential candidate, held a campaign-style gathering at which enthusiasts applauded as he proposed extending the federal Medicare health insurance program for seniors to include everyone. â€œThe American people want to know what we are going to do to fix a dysfunctional healthcare system which costs us twice as much per person as any other country and yet leaves 28 million people uninsured, and even more underinsured,â€ Sanders declared. Senator Elizabeth Warren, one of 16 Democratic co-sponsors for Sandersâ€™ proposal, told the gathering it was time to go a step beyond Obamacare, the 2010 law officially called the Affordable Care Act that expanded health coverage to 20 million Americans.  â€œWe will say that in this country everyone gets a basic right to healthcare,â€ Warren said. But in an office building nearby, Republican senators announced they were offering a â€œlast chanceâ€ to repeal Obamacare, before a parliamentary procedure allowing them to pass it with a simple majority, instead of a three-fifths majority like most Senate legislation, expires at the end of September. They proposed replacing the law with a program that would give states money in the form of block grants to run their own healthcare programs. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one of the planâ€™s authors, said he was not ready to give up the long-held Republican goal of repealing Obamacare despite a stunning failure to muster enough votes within the party this summer to kill the law. â€œThe idea that the Republican party has done its best to repeal and replace Obamacare is a joke,â€ said Graham, who was joined by fellow Republican Bill Cassidy in the effort. A system of U.S. government-run healthcare for all is anathema to many Republicans, who think the hybrid Obamacare system in which government subsidizes private health insurance already was a step too far. Republicansâ€™ last attempt in July to overturn Obamacare fell one vote short in the Senate in a humiliating defeat for President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. In addition to the Sanders and Graham-Cassidy proposals, a bipartisan effort is under way in the Senate health committee to repair Obamacare without repealing it, by protecting subsidies that are paid to insurance companies to help offset discounts under the program. McConnell this week declined to comment on either the Cassidy-Graham bill or the bipartisan health committee effort, saying the way forward was not clear. The Republican leader is not expected to bring Sandersâ€™ proposal to the Senate floor for a vote.  Trump applauded Graham and Cassidy, saying he hoped the senators â€œhave found a way to address the Obamacare crisis.â€ Trump has frequently complained that Obamacare is in crisis. Democrats dispute this but many admit there is room for improvement. A greater than expected mixture of sick and healthy customers hampered Obamacare from the start, leading to large premium increases and many counties have just one insurer.    ",Real

"Prayer, principle guide women voters in Roy Moore's Alabama hometown GADSDEN, Ala. (Reuters) - In a U.S. Senate race rocked by allegations of sexual misconduct against Republican candidate Roy Moore, some women in his hometown said they were sticking by the embattled nominee while others said prayer would guide their votes on Tuesday. Caroll Norman, a retired middle school teacher in Gadsden, said she did not know if she would vote for a Democrat for the first time in her life or write in another name on her ballot. Perusing a candle shop downtown Monday evening, the Trump supporter said not even the presidentâ€™s vocal backing of the embattled Republican nominee had swayed her. â€œIâ€™ll have to pray about it and make a decision in the morning,â€ the 64-year-old Republican said. Reuters spoke to more than a dozen women in the religious, working-class city of about 36,000 people an hour from Birmingham. Gadsden landed in an unwelcome spotlight after multiple women came forward last month to accuse Moore of pursuing them when they were teenagers and he was a local prosecutors in his 30s. One accuser said he tried to initiate sexual contact with her when she was 14. Moore denounced the allegations as political attacks and refused to heed national Republicansâ€™ calls to leave the race. Reuters has not independently confirmed any of the accusations. Norman said there were inconsistencies in the womenâ€™s stories, as well as in some of Mooreâ€™s responses.  Nearby at a bus stop downtown, where Christmas music played from speakers on light poles, Republican Sara Teet, 35, said she also remained conflicted. â€œI just donâ€™t know what to believe,â€ she said. â€œI donâ€™t know what to do.â€  But at the Gadsden Mall, Republican Debbie Handy said she was voting for â€œthe judge,â€ as many locals refer to Moore, a former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice.  â€œIâ€™ve known him a long time and heâ€™d never have anything to do with those women,â€ Handy, 40, said. â€œHeâ€™s a man of integrity. Heâ€™s a strong Christian.â€ Handy said she also liked Moore because he supports Trump, who last year won 73 percent of the presidential vote in Etowah County, where Gadsden is the county seat. â€œTrump and Moore will bring America back to what it should be,â€ she said. Robin Gibson, 61, a store clerk and self-described liberal Democrat, said she knew one of Mooreâ€™s accusers and she believed the allegations against him. Her vote on Tuesday for Democrat Doug Jones would have nothing to do with thwarting Trump or trying to erode the slim margin Republicans hold in the Senate, she said. â€œThis isnâ€™t a race about Trumpâ€™s plans for our country. Itâ€™s about who represents my state,â€ Gibson said. Around town, where there were noticeably few campaign signs for either candidate, many voters echoed the sentiments of Pat Miller in the final hours of the race. â€œWeâ€™ve had CNN and the Washington Post and some fellas from New York City all over the place,â€ said Miller, 54, as she walked out of the Gadsden Variety CafÃ© with a bowl of hot chili. â€œAllÂ IÂ can say is that we all canâ€™t wait for this to be over.â€ ",Real
" Court Just Gave Cops Permission To Murder Dogs The 6th District Court in Ohio ruled on Monday that if a cop comes to your home, they are justified in killing your dog if your dog does so much as move.Mark and Cheryl Brown sued the Battle Creek, Michigan police department after, during a search of their homes, the police killed their two pit bulls. All the dogs were guilty of was moving. They argued in court that the officers  actions violated the Fourth Amendment, that is was an unlawful seizure of property.In the case of the Browns  two pit bulls, the imminent threat came from the dogs barking and moving around. One officer shot the first pit bull after he said it  had only moved a few inches  in a movement that he considered to be a  lunge.  The injured dog retreated to the basement, where the officer shot and killed it as well as the second dog while conducting a sweep of the residence. Officer Klein testified that after he shot and killed the first dog, he noticed the second dog standing about halfway across the basement,  the court s opinion explained.  The second dog was not moving towards the officers when they discovered her in the basement, but rather she was  just standing there,  barking and was turned sideways to the officers. Klein then fired the first two rounds at the second dog. The court, of course, placed the burden on the homeowners. It was up to them to prove that the first dog didn t lunge (how do they prove that?) and that the second dog didn t bark.While the benefit of the doubt typically goes to police now   they are rarely prosecuted and even more rarely convicted for killing people   it appears that cops can now legally kill dogs, just because they are afraid of them. In fact, nearly 25 dogs are killed at the hands of police each and every day. This is heartbreaking. Expect cops to get even more rights over the people they are supposed to protect under a Donald Trump presidency.Featured image via Pixabay.",Fake

" Madeleine Albright: Trump Needs To Stay The F*ck Away From Kim Jong Un (VIDEO) Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright weighed in on Donald Trump s remarks about what a brilliant leader he thinks Kim Jong Un is, including his comment that he would be ever so  honored  to meet with him. Her take on the situation is that Trump needs to stay the hell away from the North Korean dictator. Far, far away. A president doesn t go to a country without any preparation, and  honored  would definitely be the wrong way to discuss somebody who is keeping his people in poverty and starving and control,  Albright told CNN s Jake Tapper on Tuesday.Trump has repeatedly gushed about how much he loves various autocrats from around the world and recently he has been singing the praises of Kim Jong Un. On Sunday, he said on CBS  Face The Nation that the murderous leader was a  smart cookie,  you know, for killing off family members to stay in power and other fun stuff like that. Then, on Monday, Trump told Bloomberg that he would be  honored  to meet with Kim Jong Un if the  circumstances  happened to be right.Albright slammed Trump for kissing up to dictators, especially the likes of Kim Jong Un. I think that part of the issue is that President Trump seems to believe that he can have just one-on-one relationships. And maybe that s possible in business, but that is not something that is possible as president of the United States,  she said.  This is not a matter of charming, by saying you re  honored  and he s a  smart cookie.' The former secretary of state has spoken out against Trump and his piss poor excuse for foreign policy from the very beginning of his candidacy. Tuesday s comments come amid rising tensions between the U.S. and North Korea over Pyongyang s weapons program.You can watch Albright s entire interview here:Featured image via video screen capture",Fake
"Delays dog 'shovel ready' projects in Trump's infrastructure plan NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump reassured manufacturers gathered in the White House Roosevelt room on March 31 that a massive infrastructure program was coming soon. â€œWeâ€™re going to make it happenâ€ this year, he said, according to Drew Greenblatt, the president of Marlin Steel in Baltimore, who was present. â€œThat was actually the first thing that he talked about behind closed doors with us,â€ Greenblatt added. But putting a trillion-dollar infrastructure program to work could be easier said than done, as some of the projects suggested to the administration underscore.Â  Project lists submitted by the North Americaâ€™s Building Trades Unions and by an outside developer who helped with the transition both contain projects that infrastructure builders call â€œshovel ready.â€ But, for a range of reasons, shovel ready does not always mean ready for shovels to break ground. That means any effort to jump-start projects, put people to work and inject economic stimulus could drag on Trumpâ€™s promise for a 10-year, $1 trillion infrastructure project After North Americaâ€™s Building Trades Unions (NABTU) president Sean McGarvey met with Trump on January 23, the group submitted a total of 26 bridge, pipeline and water projects. A second list of 51 projects was assembled by Ohio developer Dan Slane, who assisted with the transition, including everything from inland waterways to ports to a new FBI headquarters. While details on Trumpâ€™s plans are scant, a senior administration official said theyâ€™re looking for ways to shorten the lengthy permitting process. â€œThe current system has just lost its way,â€ he said. Nine projects have garnered the support of both Slane and the NABTU, appearing on both lists; of those, seven have yet to start construction, and one has only done preliminary construction, highlighting how hard it is to launch infrastructure projects as quickly as Trump wants to do. â€œThe shovel ready moniker that they put on projects, itâ€™s just rarely applicable,â€ said Bill Miller, president and chief executive of two companies that overlap the two lists. The Power Company of Wyoming LLC is building the Chokecherry and Sierra Madre Wind Energy Project, and TransWest Express LLCÂ is developing the TransWest Express Transmission Project, crossing Wyoming, Colorado, Utah and Nevada.  The Chokecherry and Sierra Madre wind project, which is being built in part on federal land, took eight years and â€œtens of millions of dollarsâ€ before it could recently start construction. The TransWest Express transmission project is still waiting for several state-level permits, Miller said. â€œTo be shovel ready is incredibly expensive and time consuming,â€ Miller added. The administration says it wants to get ground broken fast. But some of that just might be out of the presidentâ€™s hands, such as state-level permitting. â€œA significant part of the presidentâ€™s infrastructure plan will focus on streamlining regulating and permitting so that it is easier for all viable projects to move forward in a timely manner. These reforms might not be driven by the hurdles facing a single project, but rather will create more certainty in the process overall,â€ a White House spokesperson told Reuters. The delays that have beset a desalination plant proposed by Poseidon Water, a developer of water-related infrastructure, in Huntington Beach, California illustrate how clashing interests and regulations can hold up projects. Poseidon first proposed the idea of a plant to turn salt water into drinking water for Orange County in the late 1990s and started permitting in the early 2000s, said Scott Maloni, a vice president at Poseidon and the Huntington Beach project manager. The city of Huntington Beach originally approved the project in February 2006. But Poseidon still needed to secure 24 permits from state agencies, such as approval from the Santa Ana Regional Water Quality Control Board for the plantâ€™s national pollutant discharge elimination system, which is required by the Environmental Protection Agency.  After the city issued the necessary local approvals in 2006, project builder Poseidon was able to apply to the California Coastal Commission.Â  That application was amended several times over the years as the project evolved. For example, the plant had to alter its design after the state began phasing out power plants that use seawater for cooling purposes. Poseidon had planned to desalinate that wastewater, and changed its design to instead take in water directly from the ocean instead. In 2013, Poseidon shelved the permit application after the stateâ€™s coastal commission directed the company to look into concerns about the effects of the operation on fish larva in the area.Â  The application was resubmitted in 2015, and then withdrawn yet again in September 2016, because the commission wanted proof the plans complied with new, 2015-passed rules from the State Water Board on desalination plants.  That compelled Poseidon to redesign the plantâ€™s seawater intake and discharge technologies. The project still needs three more approvals, from the State Lands Commission, the Santa Ana Regional Water Quality Control Board and the California Coastal Commission. Poseidon says theyâ€™re confident theyâ€™ll secure the last approvals soon. But even then, construction might not start until the second quarter of 2018, Maloni said. And the objections from environmentalists havenâ€™t stopped.Â  The plant is â€œfar from a done deal,â€ said Mandy Sackett, the California policy coordinator for the Surfrider Foundation. The foundation argues that the plant is unnecessary, expensive and energy-intensive, putting marine life at risk. Sackett said the foundation will continue to fight the project.  â€œThereâ€™s still several opportunities for public input and important regulatory review that is yet to be completed,â€ she said.

" Trump Uses Prayer Breakfast To Mock Arnold Schwarzenegger, Gets HUMILIATED In 14 Priceless Seconds Donald Trump literally used the National Prayer Breakfast to brag about the low ratings of the new  Celebrity Apprentice  hosted by Arnold Schwarzenegger. They hired a big, big movie star, Arnold Schwarzenegger, to take my place, and we know how that turned out,  Trump said on Thursday morning in the middle of the event.  The ratings went right down the tubes, it s been a total disaster  and I want to just pray for Arnold, if we can, for those ratings. Seriously!? How can anybody who calls themselves a Christian support Trump after this? He actually used the prayer breakfast to attack a television show and bully the new host. And this is a television show that Trump is credited as an executive producer.Of all the things that he could have focused on at the breakfast, like homelessness, hunger, peace, or even the dead Navy Seal and eight-year-old girl who were killed during a military raid he ordered over the weekend, he chose to brag about the ratings of his former reality show and asked everyone to pray for it.But Arnold Schwarzenegger soon issued a response to Trump on Twitter in the form of a video message that is sure to have Trump fuming for the rest of the day. Hey, Donald, I have a great idea,  he said.  Why don t we switch jobs? You take over TV   because you re such an expert in ratings   and I take over your job so then people can finally sleep comfortably again? The National Prayer Breakfast? pic.twitter.com/KYUqEZbJIE  Arnold (@Schwarzenegger) February 2, 2017Indeed, if Trump is so concerned about the ratings of his former show, he should resign and go host it again while Schwarzenegger, who actually has governing experience, takes over the presidency.A representative for Schwarzenegger also delivered this burn. Arnold is praying that President Trump can improve his own approval ratings, which were the worst in history of any incoming president, by taking his job seriously and working inclusively. Donald Trump is an embarrassment and disgrace to this country. He is totally unqualified to be president and he should be tossed out on his ass in favor of someone like Schwarzenegger. Any so-called  Christian  who voted for Trump should be ashamed of themselves.Featured image via Zach Gibson/Getty Images",Fake

" WATCH: Trump Directs Childish Tantrum At Canada, Prime Minister Trudeau Shows Him How An Adult Acts Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau just demonstrated that he s the adult in the room when it comes to dealing with Donald Trump.In remarks from the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump launched a childish attack on our northern neighbor and longtime ally over the dairy industry in yet another overall assault on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). I want to end and add by saying that Canada   what they ve done to our dairy farm workers is a disgrace,  Trump began.  It s a disgrace. I spent time with some of the farmers in Wisconsin   and as you know, rules, regulations, different things, have changed; and our farmers in Wisconsin and New York State are being put out of business   our dairy farmers. The fact is, NAFTA   whether it s Mexico or Canada   is a disaster for our country. It s a disaster. It s a trading disaster,  Trump continued.  We can t let Canada or anybody else take advantage, and do what they do to our workers and to our farmers. We re going to have to get to the negotiating table with Canada very, very quickly this is another NAFTA disaster, and we re not going to let it continue onward. Here s the video via YouTube:Trump s tantrum drew a sharp but very adult response from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who told Bloomberg that he  understands  that governors in the border states are playing politics with the dairy issue, but then he pointed out that America  has a $400 million dairy surplus with Canada. In other words, the supply of milk in the United States has surpassed demand, which means farmers can t sell any more because there is already too much milk on the market. So it s not Canada that is the challenge here,  Trudeau continued, adding that we need to base our trading relationships on the facts so that people in both countries can succeed.Trudeau further pointed out that the United States subsidizes much of the agriculture industry and that we should  not pretend we re in a global free market when it comes to agriculture. Every country protects, for good reason, its agricultural industries. Trudeau went on to say that Canada is not going to  overreact,  but will instead  lay out the facts  and hold substantive talks about how Canada, Mexico, and the United States can fix some of the issues with NAFTA that need tweaking. Trudeau even addressed Trump directly by stating that once Trump is presented the facts he ll  take a different position. He has shown if he says one thing and actually hears good counter arguments or good reasons why he should shift his position, he will take a different position if it s a better one, if the arguments win him over,  Trudeau said.Here s the video via YouTube:Once again, Trump embarrasses himself and the United States.

" Justice Department Announces It Will No Longer Use Private Prisons Republicans are about to lose a huge source of funding as the Justice Department announces it will phase out its usage of the highly controversial (and highly racist) use of the private prison complex.The DOJ, under the leadership of Loretta Lynch, made the determination after evidence from the Inspector General s office showed private systems were less safe and less effective than state/government run facilities. Consequently, the DOJ has instructed all government contractors not to renew contracts with any private prison operations and to  substantially reduce  already existing contracts.In a statement, Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates highlighting the many faults plaguing the private system: They simply do not provide the same level of correctional services, programs, and resources; they do not save substantially on costs; and as noted in a recent report by the Department s Office of Inspector General, they do not maintain the same level of safety and security. Another cause for the discontinuation of the private system was the decline of America s prison population, which once exploded in the late 1990s and early 2000s. As recently as 10 years ago, the Department of Justice, under the Bush Administration, began contracting with private prisons to contain a population made up of seemingly petty crimes that disproportionally affected blacks and other minorities.In total, these 13 private prisons across the country will be losing their government contracts, putting a severe dent in their funding. Considering the report also detailed higher levels of assault   both by inmates and staff   and higher rates of contraband, this is a perfect example of wasteful spending Republicans are always decrying. Luckily, the Obama Administration recognizes this and is taking care of it, all without the help of the GOP.Currently, private prisons account for 12 percent of the nation s prison population at just over 22,000 inmates. According to Corrections Corporation America, the United States spent $639 million on private prisons in the 2014-2015 fiscal budget.Once again, the Obama Administration is cleaning up a big mess made by President Bush.A dark stain on modern America is finally breaking apart. Private prisons, a staple in the age of modern Jim Crow, have outlived their use (if they were ever useful in the first place). The Justice Department s decision to end its contractual obligations is a huge step in the right direction, but it remains to be seen if states like Arizona, who put funding for prisons over education, will follow the lead.Featured image via Allison Shelley/Getty Images",Fake
" Because Of Trump, We Need An Equal Rights Amendment NOW The Women s March was historic. Over four million women all across the country (and world) came out in solidarity to protest against the incoming avalanche of assault from the Trump Administration.Contrary to popular belief, the Women s March was not a protest against President Trump   it was a protest in support of women s rights.Before taking the oath of office, the Trump Administration pledged to defund all programs at the DOJ which enforce the Violence Against Women Act. Donald Trump himself has released the names of 21 conservative judges who are potential Supreme Court nominees that mirror the late Justice Antonin Scalia (who does not believe the 14th Amendment extends to women).On Monday, January 23, Trump signed an executive order imposing the  Mexico City  rule   that overseas operations (including clinics) that perform or encourage abortion will lose all federal funding from the United States.The war on women is in full force, and Trump is at the reins.That is why, now more than ever, an Equal Rights Amendment is needed.The proposal is a simple one:Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex. The Congress shall have the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article. This amendment shall take effect two years after the date of ratification.Aside from the 20th Amendment, which gives women the right to vote, there is no specific mention of women in the United States Constitution. The word  men  is mentioned a handful of times. The words  women,   ladies,  or  female  is nowhere. Not one line in the United States Constitution even alludes to the rights of women when considering historical context (aside from the 20th). Nor is the word  equality  found anywhere.Even though the Constitution states  All men are created equal,  we know that the Founders truly did not understand that. If you weren t white, a landowner, or male, the Constitution was not written with your rights in mind. Thomas Jefferson, who authored the Declaration of Independence and made significant contributions to the Constitution, wrote:Were our state a pure democracy there would still be excluded from our deliberations women, who, to prevent deprivation of morals and ambiguity of issues, should not mix promiscuity in gatherings of men.What many people fail to realize is that the rights of women that hinge on the 14th Amendment s Equal Protection Clause can easily be taken away. The 14th Amendment says that states may not  deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.  Should a Congress or bench of judges hold hostile views of women s equality, they could deem it necessary to roll back on much of the social progress made through common or statutory law. Should Trump appoint one, two or even three new Justices to the Supreme Court, who hold originalist views like Scalia, many issues such as equal pay, abortion, insurance discrimination, and so forth could vanish or become embedded in sex discrimination.The only thing women truly, inarguably have is the right to vote. But what s the point of voting if your rights as a human being could be taken away down the road in the name of jurisprudence?The argument  women already have everything the ERA would guarantee them  is not only wrong but na ve. First, women don t have  everything  equal to men in current law. There are still many statutes that separate on the basis of sex. Second, only the ERA would truly guarantee them these fundamental rights without fear of being stripped away so easily. So those opposed to the ERA actually give us a reason to support it   they admit it would guarantee equality if enacted.This wasn t always a divisive issue. Republicans use to support it. Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford supported the ERA in the 1970s, as did President Carter. This was not a partisan issue until Phyllis Schlafly came along and derailed it using scare tactics (one argument was that this would lead to same-sex marriage).But Schlafly is gone (as is Ford and Nixon), and a new era for women is on the horizon. If women came out in support for an Equal Rights Amendment as they did on January 21st, equality would be the true law of the land.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",Fake
"Republicans worry Trump scandals may doom legislative agenda WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Scandals enveloping U.S. President Donald Trump have left Republican lawmakers and lobbyists increasingly gloomy about the prospects for passing sweeping tax cuts, a rollback of Obamacare  and an ambitious infrastructure program. With the White House and both chambers of the U.S. Congress under Republican control, party leaders and their allies in the business community had expected to get quick traction on their plans, with corporate tax cuts among the top priorities. But four months into Trumpâ€™s tenure, only limited progress has been made. The House of Representatives passed a measure to rewrite Obamacare, but the Senate is only in the very early stages of considering the issue. Lawmakers are just beginning their push on tax reform. In addition to congressional probes that are taking place into possible collusion between Trumpâ€™s 2016 campaign team and Russia, the U.S. Justice Department on Wednesday named former FBI Director Robert Mueller to investigate the matter. â€œItâ€™s the elephant in the room right now,â€ said Republican Representative Pat Tiberi. â€œThe smartest minds in the White House know that, whether itâ€™s tax reform or anything else on the public policy front. Itâ€™s hard enough to get things done in the U.S. Capitol under the best of circumstances.â€ The House Ways and Means Committee will hold a hearing on tax reform on Thursday. Key administration and congressional leaders met Wednesday afternoon to discuss a path forward. But they remain a long way from signing a bill into law. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday that â€œless drama from the White Houseâ€ was needed to advance legislative priorities.  Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told reporters on Wednesday that the legislative process had â€œpretty much ground to a haltâ€ amid the tumult in Washington. Republican Representative Steve Womack said it was important for committees investigating the Russia matter to move forward expeditiously to both ensure that the public gets answers and to clear the way for Congress to move on to other issues. â€œAny time we get bogged down on these kinds of issues unrelated to the governing agenda, it serves to delay and to sometimes complicate the real job that we have to do for the American people,â€ Womack said. At a news conference on Wednesday, House Speaker Paul Ryan urged his colleagues to â€œseize this momentâ€ to pass tax reform. But instead of discussing tax rates and structures, Ryan was faced with a series of questions about James Comey, who Trump fired as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation last week, and the Russia investigation. Several lobbyists said that in the past week their corporate clients have grown more cautious on the prospects for tax reform but still hope that at least a small package can be approved.  â€œMy worry level has grown considerably,â€ one lobbyist said. Some lobbyists suggested that Congress could consider focusing on tax breaks and perhaps leave aside the comprehensive overhaul of the tax code that they had originally hoped for.  â€œWhen this all started, the thing we heard from the Hill was â€˜transformative tax reform,â€™â€ said a strategist who consults with major companies focused on tax reform. â€œI think as time passes, tax reform is going to look much different, that it may be begin to look more like tax cuts than tax reform.â€  ",Real

"U.S. House committee approves bill to increase scrutiny of Fed WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Republican-controlled committee of lawmakers approved a bill on Tuesday to allow a congressional audit of Federal Reserve monetary policy, a proposal Fed policymakers have opposed and which faces an uncertain path to final approval.  Democrats uniformly spoke against the proposal during a meeting of the House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, suggesting the bill would face stronger resistance than in the past.  â€œWe should not in any way hinder their independence,â€ said Representative Carolyn Maloney, a New York Democrat, echoing the sentiment of Fed policymakers who say they could come under political pressure to avoid making unpopular decisions such as raising interest rates to slow growth and control inflation.  The next step for the bill would be a floor vote by the entire House, where Republicans hold a solid majority. Republican President Donald Trump expressed support for audits of the U.S. central bank during his election campaign, but it remained unclear whether the White House would back the proposal. Republicans proposed numerous bills during the Obama administration to open the Fed up to deeper scrutiny, arguing the added transparency would ensure the Fed was accountable and free of outside influence.  Currently, the Fed publishes detailed audits of its finances but it keeps the inner workings of its monetary policy deliberations secret, publishing transcripts of policy meetings only with a five-year lag. The proposal approved on Tuesday would â€œput an end to that reign of secrecy,â€ said Representative Thomas Massie, the Kentucky Republican who submitted the bill. The House has already passed versions of the bill twice, with dozens of Democrats joining nearly unanimous Republican support in 2012 and 2014. Those versions of the legislation died in the Senate. Republicans control both houses of Congress but only have a narrow majority in the Senate.  Representative Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts was among Democrats who voted in favor of similar legislation in 2012 and 2014 but came out against the current proposal, saying it could lead to political interference at the Fed. Lynch said he hoped a compromise could be found that increased transparency at the Fed, such as by requiring it to publish transcripts of policy meetings two years after they take place. ",Real
" Trump Supporters Object To Prince Harryâ€™s Recent Engagement For Terrible Reasons (TWEETS) Great Britain s Buckingham Palace announced yesterday that Prince Harry, the youngest son of Diana, Princess of Wales, had gotten engaged. A royal engagement is always big news in the United Kingdom, but this one also hit home in the United States too, because Harry s now-fiance is American actress Meghan Markle, best known for her roles as Rachel Zane in the legal drama series Suits, as well as special agent Amy Jessup in the sci-fi thriller Fringe.The British royal family no longer holds anywhere near as much clout as it once did, now essentially relegated to mere tabloid fodder, but while many were expressing their happiness online for one of the Windsor s most beloved members, quite a few Trump supporters expressed their dissatisfaction at the prince s choice. You see, Markle is biracial, her father being Caucasian and her mother African-American, and in the minds of many deplorables, this is a bad thing.It s completely irrelevant that Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh and husband of the reigning Queen Elizabeth II, is half-Greek, because that is pretty much white. However, when news broke of Prince Harry s engagement to Markle, white supremacists from across the United States and around the globe took to Twitter, because in their twisted minds, disturbing the racial purity of the British royal family is not a good thing, despite the fact the fact it has been going on for centuries.

Harry thinks the president is a serious threat to human rights,  the source continued, but there might be a lot more to it than just that.When Princess Diana split from her husband, Prince Charles, in 1992, a palace aide claims that Trump was  relentless  in his pursuit of Diana, a claim backed up by British TV journalist and friend of the princess, Selina Scott. Scott said that Trump bombarded Diana at Kensington Palace with massive bouquets of flowers,  adding that he gave Diana  the creeps,  a fact Trump representatives obviously deny. Then there were these tweets from Donald Trump when Princess Kate Middleton, wife of Harry s brother, Prince William, was illegally photographed by paparazzi sunbathing topless in her backyard in 2012:Kate Middleton is great but she shouldn't be sunbathing in the nude only herself to blame.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 17, 2012Who wouldn't take Kate's picture and make lots of money if she does the nude sunbathing thing. Come on Kate!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 17, 2012Meghan Markle has also been a critic of the President, calling him misogynistic  and once even threatened to leave the US if he became president, so she would most likely be fine with Trump s non-attendance at her wedding, but his supporters won t take too kindly to him being shunned.Featured image via Chris Jackson/Getty Images for the Invictus Games Foundation",Fake
"Trump to name New York lawyer to lead Justice Dept. civil unit: source WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is expected to nominate New York lawyer George T. Conway III to lead the U.S. Justice Departmentâ€™s civil division, a source briefed on the matter said on Friday. Conway, the husband of Trumpâ€™s senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway, is a partner at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. He has represented Philip Morris International Inc,  Cardinal Health Inc and the National Football League among many corporate clients.  He did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. The White House and Justice Department also declined comment. As head of the civil division, Conway would be in charge of defending government actions, including Trumpâ€™s revised executive order banning citizens from six Muslim-majority nations from traveling to the United States. This week, judges in Hawaii and Maryland blocked implementation of Trumpâ€™s order that retains a 90-day ban on travel to the United States by citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen that was part of an earlier order  blocked by the courts. Conway was one of a team of lawyers who drafted a legal brief on behalf of Paula Jones who sued President Bill Clinton for sexual harassment, according to numerous media reports. Conway wrote in a 1994 Los Angeles Times op-ed that Clinton should not have immunity from Jonesâ€™ lawsuit â€œbecause it would place presidents above the law. It would enable a president to take out a mortgage on a summer home, refuse to make payments and yet be immune from foreclosure for four or eight years.â€  The civil division defends U.S. agencies against thousands of lawsuits filed annually over government policies, laws, domestic and foreign operations, entitlement programs, law enforcement and military actions, and counter-terrorism efforts. The division also sues on behalf of the government to recoup money lost through fraud, loan defaults and the abuse of federal funds, especially involving Medicare. ",Real
"Boehner: Trump has been 'complete disaster' WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s time in office has been a â€œcomplete disasterâ€ aside from foreign affairs, fellow Republican and former U.S. House Speaker John Boehner said at an energy conference. The former Ohio congressman said he has been friends with Trump for 15 years but never thought he would occupy the White House.  And while he praised Trumpâ€™s aggressive steps to challenge the Islamic State militant group and other moves in international affairs, he was highly critical of the presidentâ€™s other early efforts. â€œEverything else heâ€™s done has been a complete disaster,â€ Boehner said at the energy conference in Houston on Wednesday, according to the energy publication Rigzone. â€œHeâ€™s still learning how to be president.â€ A spokesman for Boehner confirmed the comments. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Boehnerâ€™s remarks. The former House speaker, who resigned from Congress in 2015, was also highly critical of efforts by the administration and his former Republican colleagues in Congress to advance sweeping healthcare and tax reform plans. He said Republicans should never have tried to â€œrepeal and replaceâ€ the Affordable Care Act, even after the House narrowly passed an overhaul measure. The Senate is considering its own version of the package. And he dismissed tax reform efforts, which form a cornerstone of the Republican policy agenda, as â€œjust a bunch of happy talk.â€ While Boehnerâ€™s successor, Speaker Paul Ryan, tries to include a border adjustment tax, a tax on imports, as a key piece of any tax code overhaul, Boehner declared it â€œdeader than a doornailâ€ amid opposition from fellow Republicans and the White House. Boehner also supported efforts to â€œget to the bottomâ€ of any potential interactions between Trump associates and the Russian government. However, he described any calls to impeach Trump as the purview of â€œthe crazy left-wing Democratic colleagues of mine.â€ Democratic Representative Al Green has formally introduced articles of impeachment for Trump, but such an effort has not been embraced by most Democratic lawmakers as the investigation continues.

"Factbox: Review of U.S. national monuments could unlock new energy reserves  (In this June 9 story, corrects name of company in paragraph 6 to California Resources Corporation; adds â€œmillionâ€ in final paragraph) WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke will make a recommendation to the White House on Saturday on whether to rescind or resize the Bears Ears monument in Utah, setting the tone for the Trump administrationâ€™s broader study of which lands protected by past presidents should be reopened to development. It is unclear when the decision will be made public.  While the land encompassed by the 1.35 million-acre Bears Ears monument is not believed to contain massive amounts of coal, oil or gas, several other monuments on Zinkeâ€™s review list may, making the Bears Ears decision important to industry groups. Here is a list: Barack Obama designated this 704,000 acres of southeastern Nevada a national monument in 2015. The area sits in the Chainman Shale play, which is believed by some in the drilling industry to be a promising reserve.  Barack Obama designated this 1.35 million acres in southeastern Utah a national monument in late 2016, shortly before leaving office. The area, which surrounds a pair of iconic buttes, has moderate oil and gas potential, and one oil company, EOG Resources, was granted drilling leases within its boundaries shortly before the designation.  Bill Clinton designated this 178,000-acre area in southwestern Colorado a national monument in 2000, but because it was already an active zone for the oil and gas industry, he granted drillers an allowance to continue to operate there, with limitations. Bill Clinton designated this 204,000-acre area in California a national monument in 2001. It is located in an area that has seen oil exploration in the past and has some moderate potential for commercial reservoirs. California Resources Corporation has pre-existing drilling rights on part of the monument, but has not yet made a big find. GRAND STAIRCASE-ESCALANTE: Bill Clinton designated this 1.9 million acre swath of southern Utah a national monument in 1996. It holds roughly 62 billion tons of coal, along with coal bed gas, and potentially commercial quantities of oil, according to the Utah Geological Survey. (here ) Bill Clinton designated this 495,000 acre area of central Montana a national monument in 2001. In 1995, the U.S. Geological Survey estimated the area held somewhere between 58.2 and 719.9 billion cubic feet of natural gas, along with between 14 million and 180 million barrels oil.

"U.N. vote Saturday on U.S. bid to slash North Korea exports over missile tests UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations Security Council is set to vote on Saturday on a U.S.-drafted resolution that aims to slash by a third North Koreaâ€™s $3 billion annual export revenue over Pyongyangâ€™s two intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) tests in July.  A council diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there was a â€œhigh confidenceâ€ that North Korea ally China and Russia would support the draft resolution, which was circulated to the 15 Security Council members on Friday. The council is due to vote at 3 p.m. EDT (1900 GMT). A resolution needs nine votes in favor, and no vetoes by the United States, China, Russia, France or Britain, to be adopted.  The draft resolution would ban North Koreaâ€™s exports of coal, iron, iron ore, lead, lead ore and seafood. It would also prohibit countries from increasing the current numbers of North Korean laborers working abroad, ban new joint ventures with North Korea and any new investment in current joint ventures. â€œThese are export sectors where this money is viewed as a critical, critical source of hard currency that the North immediately turns around into its fantastically expensive war machine and these just amazingly expensive ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs,â€ the diplomat said. â€œThese sanctions are not targeted at the people of North Korea,â€ the diplomat said.  The draft resolution would also add nine individuals and four entities to the U.N. blacklist, including North Koreaâ€™s primary foreign exchange bank, subjecting them to a global asset freeze and travel ban. The United States and China have been negotiating the draft text for the past month. Typically, they agree sanctions on North Korea before formally involving other council members. U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s administration has been frustrated that China has not done more to rein in North Korea and Washington has threatened to impose new sanctions on Chinese firms doing business with Pyongyang. â€œThe Trump administration should issue new sanctions against China at the same time the new resolution is adopted as Beijing is still violating U.S. law by allowing its companies, individuals, and banks to facilitate North Koreaâ€™s sanctions evasion,â€ said Anthony Ruggiero, a Foundation for Defense of Democracies senior fellow and former U.S. Treasury official. China has also been upset by possible moves by the Trump administration to exert trade pressure on Beijing.    â€œ(The draft) appears to reflect a compromise between the U.S. and China in several areas,â€ Bonnie Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said. â€œIt notably does not include any reduction in Chinese crude oil shipments to North Korea.â€ While supportive of new U.N. action, Security Council member Sweden said sanctions alone could not solve the problem. â€œMore creative diplomacy is urgently needed. A long-term solution can only be achieved through dialogue and negotiations,â€ said Swedenâ€™s Deputy U.N. Ambassador Carl Skau.  The United States had been informally keeping Britain and France in the loop on the bilateral negotiations, while U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said China had been sharing the draft and negotiating with Russia. It has not been clear if poor relations between Russia and the United States, which imposed new unilateral sanctions on Moscow on Wednesday, would hamper negotiations. Moscow has disagreed with assessments by Western powers that Pyongyang launched two long-range missiles, saying they were mid-range. Diplomats say China and Russia only view a test of a long-range missile or a nuclear weapon as a trigger for further possible U.N. sanctions. North Korea has been under U.N. sanctions since 2006 over its ballistic missile and nuclear programs and the Security Council has ratcheted up the measures in response to five nuclear weapons tests and two long-range missile launches. The U.N. diplomat said North Korea has been estimated to earn in 2017 $400 million from coal, $251 million from iron and iron ore, $113 million from lead and lead ore and $295 million from seafood. The diplomat said it was difficult to estimate how much North Korea was earning from sending workers abroad.  A United Nations human rights investigator said in 2015 that North Korea has forced more than 50,000 people to work abroad, mainly in Russia and China, earning the country between $1.2 billion and $2.3 billion a year for the government.

"Trump backtracks on cyber unit with Russia after harsh criticism WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday backtracked on his push for a cyber security unit with Russia, tweeting that he did not think it could happen, hours after his proposal was harshly criticized by Republicans who said Moscow could not be trusted. Trump said on Twitter early on Sunday that he and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed on Friday forming â€œan impenetrable Cyber Security unitâ€ to address issues like the risk of cyber meddling in elections. The idea appeared to be a political non-starter. It was immediately scorned by several of Trumpâ€™s fellow Republicans, who questioned why the United States would work with Russia after Moscowâ€™s alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. â€œItâ€™s not the dumbest idea I have ever heard but itâ€™s pretty close,â€ Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina told NBCâ€™s â€œMeet the Pressâ€ program.  Ash Carter, who was U.S. defense secretary until the end of former Democratic President Barack Obamaâ€™s administration in January, told CNN flatly: â€œThis is like the guy who robbed your house proposing a working group on burglary.â€ Trumpâ€™s advisers, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, had recently sought to explain Trumpâ€™s cyber push. Mnuchin said on Saturday that Trump and Putin had agreed to create â€œa cyber unit to make sure that there was absolutely no interference whatsoever, that they would work on cyber security together.â€ But Trump returned to Twitter on Sunday to play down the idea, which arose at his talks with Putin at a summit of the Group of 20 nations in Hamburg, Germany.  â€œThe fact that President Putin and I discussed a Cyber Security unit doesnâ€™t mean I think it can happen. It canâ€™t,â€  Trump said on Twitter.  He then noted that an agreement with Russia for a ceasefire in Syria â€œcan & didâ€ happen. Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona acknowledged Trumpâ€™s desire to move forward with Russia, but added: â€œThere has to be a price to pay.â€ â€œThere has been no penalty,â€ McCain, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, told CBSâ€™ â€œFace the Nationâ€ program according to a CBS transcript. â€œVladimir Putin ... got away with literally trying to change the outcome ... of our election.â€ Trump argued for a rapprochement with Moscow in his campaign but has been unable to deliver because his administration has been dogged by investigations into the allegations of Russian interference in the election and ties with his campaign. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating the matter, including whether there may have been any collusion on the part of Trump campaign officials, as are congressional committees including both the House of Representatives and Senate intelligence panels. Those probes are focused almost exclusively on Moscowâ€™s actions, lawmakers and intelligence officials say, and no evidence has surfaced publicly implicating other countries despite Trumpâ€™s suggestion that others could have been involved. Moscow has denied any interference, and Trump says his campaign did not collude with Russia. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told CNNâ€™s â€œState of the Unionâ€ program that Russia could not be a credible partner in a cyber security unit. â€œIf thatâ€™s our best election defense, we might as well just mail our ballot boxes to Moscow,â€ Schiff added. Separately, U.S. government officials said a recent hack into business systems of U.S. nuclear power and other energy companies was carried out by Russian government hackers, the Washington Post reported on Saturday. Trump said he â€œstrongly pressed President Putin twice about Russian meddling in our election. He vehemently denied it.â€ He added: â€œWe negotiated a ceasefire in parts of Syria which will save lives. Now it is time to move forward in working constructively with Russia!â€ In Trumpâ€™s first attempt at ending the six-year Syrian civil war, the United States, Russia and Jordan on Friday reached a ceasefire and â€œde-escalation agreementâ€ for southwestern Syria. The ceasefire was holding hours after it took effect on Sunday, a monitor and two rebel officials said.     Any joint U.S.-Russia cyber initiative would have been a different matter. Depending how much it veered into military or espionage operations, it could have faced major legal hurdles. Language in the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act prohibits the Pentagon, which includes the National Security Agency and the U.S. militaryâ€™s Cyber Command, from using any funds for bilateral military cooperation with Russia. Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia, also noted restrictions on sharing information with Russia that would clearly prohibit offering Moscow a sense of U.S. cyber capabilities. Russia would be similarly adverse to revealing its capabilities to the United States, he noted. â€œIt just will not happen,â€ McFaul told Reuters.  ",Real

"Trump thanks Putin for slashing U.S. diplomatic staff WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday thanked Russian President Vladimir Putin for ordering the United States to slash its diplomatic staff in Russia, remarks likely to rekindle criticism of Trumpâ€™s kid-gloves handling of Putin.  Breaking nearly two weeks of silence on Putinâ€™s July 30 order cutting U.S. embassy and consulate staff by nearly two thirds, Trump said: â€œIâ€™m very thankful that he let go of a large number of people because now we have a smaller payroll.â€ Trump said â€œthereâ€™s no real reason for them to go backâ€ and â€œweâ€™re going to save a lot of money,â€ in response to Putinâ€™s Cold War-style move, differing from the reactions of other presidents in similar circumstances in the past. It also clashes with a State Department official having called Moscowâ€™s order â€œa regrettable and uncalled-for act.â€ On Thursday, the State Department had no immediate reaction to the comments Trump made to reporters while on vacation at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Congressional committees and a special counsel are investigating the conclusions of U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the 2016 election campaign by hacking and other methods to help Trump, a Republican. They are also looking into possible collusion between the campaign and Russian officials. Moscow has repeatedly denied meddling in the election and Trump denies any campaign collusion. Putin, reacting to new sanctions imposed by the U.S. Congress and reluctantly signed into law by Trump, ordered Washington to cut 755 of its 1,200 embassy and consulate staff by September. Many of those affected likely will be local Russian staffers. It was also a tit-for-tat reaction to former President Barack Obama expelling 35 Russian diplomats from the United States last December over the intelligence agency reports. During his campaign and since becoming president, Trump has consistently called for better ties with Russia, declined to criticize Putin and refused to unequivocally embrace the conclusions of the intelligence agencies.  Intended to be flippant or not, Trumpâ€™s remarks on Thursday were immediately denounced by current and former U.S. officials who have served both Republican and Democratic administrations. Nicholas Burns, the State Departmentâ€™s third-ranking official under Republican President George W. Bush, called Trumpâ€™s comments â€œgrotesque.â€ â€œIf he was joking, he should know better,â€ said Burns, now a professor at Harvard Universityâ€™s John F. Kennedy School of Government. â€œIf he wasnâ€™t, itâ€™s unprecedented. A president has never defended the expulsion of our diplomats.â€  The State Department has â€œhorrified and rattledâ€ by Trumpâ€™s remarks, said a veteran U.S. diplomat who has served in Russia, speaking on condition of anonymity. And Heather Conley, formerly a top State Department official dealing with European affairs, said the expulsions of hundreds of people from an important U.S. embassy is extraordinary and â€œit is very difficult to see how the president could view these expulsions as a â€˜positiveâ€™ development in any form.â€ In additional remarks on Thursday, Trump said he was surprised by the FBI raid last month on the home of his former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, adding that it sent a â€œstrong signal.â€ Trump said he has not given any thought to the possibility of firing special counsel Robert Mueller. In May, Trump dismissed James Comey, who was Director of the FBI when Trump went into office seven months ago. As presidential candidate, Trump invited Russia to dig up thousands of â€œmissingâ€ emails from Democratic rival Hillary Clintonâ€™s time as secretary of state, vexing intelligence experts and prompting Democrats to accuse him of urging a foreign country to spy on Americans. â€œRussia, if youâ€™re listening, I hope youâ€™re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,â€ Trump said on the campaign. Clinton kept a private server from 2009 to 2013. She handed over thousands of emails in 2015 to investigators, but did not release about 30,000 she said were personal and not work-related. ",Real

"Lawmaker says U.S. foreign surveillance 'unmasked' Trump associates WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives intelligence committee set off a political firestorm on Wednesday when he said the communications of members of Donald Trumpâ€™s transition team were caught up in incidental surveillance targeting foreigners. Representative Devin Nunes said at a news conference that it was possible President Trumpâ€™s own communications were also intercepted and disseminated among U.S. intelligence agencies. The White House seized on Nunesâ€™ remarks, which had cited anonymous sources, to bolster Trumpâ€™s unproven assertion that former President Barack Obamaâ€™s administration spied on the incoming president. Nunes himself said there is no proof of that, as have other lawmakers of both parties and the FBI director. A short while later, Trump spokesman Sean Spicer cited Nunesâ€™ comments at his White House news briefing. â€œI do think it is a startling revelation, and thereâ€™s a lot of questions that need to get asked,â€ Spicer said. Democrats denounced Nunesâ€™ statements as highly unusual from the chairman of an intelligence committee, with the top Democrat on the committee saying its members had not been informed and implying that Nunes was giving political cover to the president. Intelligence reports about the communications appeared to â€œunmaskâ€ the identity of the Trump associates and the names were widely shared among the agencies, Nunes said. He said it was possible Trumpâ€™s own communications were also collected. The National Security Agency routinely collects electronic communications on foreigners through a variety of surveillance tools. But information about Americans is also sometimes incidentally gathered, such as when someone is communicating to a foreign target.  Typically the names of Americans are made anonymous, or masked, in foreign intelligence reports unless an intelligence agency determines the identity of that person is relevant to national security or a criminal investigation. It was unclear why the reports Nunes cited contained unmasked names. A U.S. government source said it was logical, if not normal, that communications from Trump aides would have been incidentally intercepted by U.S. agencies after his election, given that they would have an interest in talking to foreign governments. Trump took office on Jan. 20. Two days ago, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, James Comey, told a hearing of Nunesâ€™ committee that his agency was conducting a criminal investigation of potential links between Trump associates and Russiaâ€™s attempts to influence the 2016 U.S. election to benefit Trump. â€œI recently confirmed that on numerous occasions the intelligence community ... collected information about U.S. citizens involved in the Trump transition,â€ said Nunes, who was himself on Trumpâ€™s transition team. Nunes said he was referring to intelligence reports of communications collected under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. â€œI want to be clear, none of this surveillance was related to Russia or the investigation of Russian activities or of the Trump team,â€ he said. Trump said he felt â€œsomewhatâ€ vindicated by Nunesâ€™ announcement after being briefed by Nunes. FBI head Comey on Monday said that Trumpâ€™s claims were groundless. According to Nunes, the conversations in question were collected legally in November, December and January. In an interview with CNN, the committeeâ€™s leading Democrat, Adam Schiff said, â€œThe chairman will need to decide whether he is the chairman of an independent investigation into conduct which includes allegations of potential coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russians, or heâ€™s going to act as a surrogate of the White House, because he cannot do both.â€ Nunesâ€™ remarks appeared tied to a line of questioning from Republicans during Mondayâ€™s hearing about the importance of identifying and prosecuting those responsible for intelligence leaks. Republicans have focused much of their discussion of the issue on the release of the names, or â€œunmaskingâ€ of Trump associates in the investigation. Trump fired his former national security adviser, General Mike Flynn, after the revelation that he had spoken to Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak, during the transition - which was leaked to the press after those calls were caught by surveillance intercepts. Nunes appeared to suggest intelligence reports about intercepts other than Flynnâ€™s conversations existed.     Former intelligence officials and Democrats said Nunesâ€™ announcement was highly unusual from the chairman of an intelligence committee. Schiff said he was not consulted by Nunes before his news conference. Nunesâ€™ decision to share the information with the White House before informing the committee was a â€œprofound irregularity,â€ Schiff said, adding that â€œa credible investigation cannot be conducted this way.â€ Schiff said the unmasking of a U.S. person may be appropriate in the context of an investigation. U.S. intelligence agencies have accused Russia of seeking to influence the presidential election in Trumpâ€™s favor against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton by hacking computer systems and spreading disinformation. Russia denies the allegations. Nunes said he was â€œvery concernedâ€ about whether U.S. intelligence agencies were spying on Trump. He briefed Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan before the news conference and went to the White House to share the information. Admiral Mike Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, was asked by Republicans at Mondayâ€™s hearing about the agencyâ€™s policies for â€œunmaskingâ€ the names of Americans whose communications were incidentally collected under foreign surveillance programs. Rogers said that 20 NSA employees, including himself, have the authority to unmask the identity of an Americanâ€™s communications, and that senior officials at the CIA, FBI and Justice Department can make such a request. Asked how many Americans had been unmasked since June 2016, Rogers said he did not know. ",Real
"Egypt defends NGO law U.S. senators call a draconian rights crackdown WASHINGTON/CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt defended on Thursday a new law on non-governmental organizations that three U.S. Republican senators have called â€œdraconianâ€ and a sign of â€œa growing crackdown on human rights and peaceful dissentâ€. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Raâ€™ad Al Hussein also criticized the law, saying it â€œeffectively hands administration of NGOs to the governmentâ€.     The law, issued on Monday after being ratified by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, restricts NGO activity to developmental and social work and introduces jail terms of up to five years for non-compliance. Egyptian lawmakers said the law was necessary to protect national security. The government has long accused human rights groups of taking foreign funds to sow chaos and several are facing investigation over their funding. Cairoâ€™s foreign ministry denied the law aimed to restrict NGOs and said some of them â€œhave gotten used to working outside the law ... to defame the image of civil society in Egyptâ€. In Washington on Wednesday, Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham said in a joint statement: â€œPresident al-Sisiâ€™s decision to ratify the draconian legislation ... that regulates the work of non-governmental organizations is the latest sign of a growing crackdown on human rights and peaceful dissent in Egypt.â€  McCain, who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Graham said the U.S. Congress should in response â€œstrengthen democratic benchmarks and human rights conditions on U.S. assistance for Egypt.â€ That sentiment was echoed by Senator Marco Rubio, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who said the law would have a â€œterrible impactâ€ on Egyptâ€™s ability to make reforms and would have implications for U.S.-Egypt relations. â€œThis law is a direct attack on independent civil society in Egypt,â€ Rubio said in a statement. The UN human rights chief Zeid said on Thursday that the new law makes rights defenders even more vulnerable than before. â€œThe crucial function of these NGOs â€“ to hold the state accountable for its human rights obligations â€“ has been severely hampered already through asset freezes, travel bans, smear campaigns and prosecutions. This new law further tightens the noose,â€ he said in a statement. In Egyptâ€™s response, foreign ministry spokesman Ahmed Abu Zeid said: â€œIt is important to be vigilant about the intention of some civil society entities that have gotten used to working outside the law, and that were harmed by the issuing of the new law, to defame the image of civil society in Egypt.â€  Egypt is one of Washingtonâ€™s closest allies in the Middle East, receiving $1.3 billion in U.S. military aid annually. U.S. President Donald Trump praised Sisi after a meeting in Saudi Arabia last week, saying the Egyptian leader had â€œdone a tremendous job under trying circumstance.â€ ",Real
" Hillaryâ€™s Hires Show Clear Progressive Influence From The Warren Wing Of The Democratic Party Elizabeth Warren wants a say in who Hillary Clinton hires to be part of her administration s transition team. In fact, Warren made a list of names she absolutely will not accept and Clinton seems to be receptive.According to Politico, Warren has vowed to fight any political appointments or nominees with ties to big banks. She also wants to shut down the government-to-corporate revolving door.The liberal wing s early jockeying is already paying off. POLITICO reported this week that Rohit Chopra, who was hired by Warren at the CFPB, is joining Clinton s transition team. And Heather Boushey, popular among progressives because of her focus on income inequality, was recently chosen as the team s chief economist. Liberals applauded both hires as a sign Clinton is taking them seriously.What is more, the Democratic Party platform embraced the senator s position that only officials  who are not beholden to the industries they regulate  should get appointments.One of the biggest complaints about Hillary Clinton is exactly the same complaint many had about her husband as president: she s a political being and yes, she does sometimes base her actions on the polls. The cynical call this type of politicking  pandering,  but there are many who call it democratic. Or, to put it another way, after more than 30 years of the country taking a big swing to the right, we re seeing the pendulum swing back to the left. Clinton has read the writing on the wall thanks to Warren, and well, she can t afford to be center-right.Warren and other progressives are holding Clinton to her more populist promises through the think tank, the Roosevelt Institute, whose mission is to fight income inequality and corporate control. Felicia Wong, who heads the Roosevelt Institute, is in pretty much constant contact with Clinton s team.The goal, (Progressive Change Campaign Committee co-founder Adam) Green said, is to have more people associated with Warren and Stiglitz represented in positions throughout the government,  and not just Robert Rubin clones.  Rubin, who once co-chaired Goldman Sachs and was a top executive at Citigroup, was a Treasury secretary under Bill Clinton, where he pushed for market deregulation and deficit reduction.If Clinton wins, her administration will likely be hounded by progressive watch dogs, and that s exactly what she needs. Progressives are a large voting bloc, and if we let ourselves, we can also become a powerful one, even with a nominee who s not Bernie Sanders.Featured image via Jessica Kourkounis/Getty Images.",Fake
" Neo-Nazis Are Flocking To Trumpâ€™s Campaign And Openly Bragging About It The Nazis see Donald Trump as their pathway back to power so they are joining his campaign in droves.It s not exactly a secret that white supremacists, including neo-Nazis and members of the KKK, are supportive of the Republican nominee. But this election is especially different because of how emboldened they are about Donald Trump.Nazis in this country have been on the fringe of our society for decades, which is where they belong. But Donald Trump is giving them the seat at the mainstream table that they have desperately desired and Republicans don t see any problem with that at all.And that s why these racists are not only able to openly volunteer for Trump campaign, they are able to openly brag about doing so and have no problem boasting about the goals they are trying to achieve. There s a connection   it isn t always policy   but a deep visceral, you could say emotional connection between the alt-right and his campaign,  white supremacist Richard Spencer told the Los Angeles Times. I think he does recognize that he has this alt-right army behind him. I think he also realizes if he backs down, if he stops being combative, he is in danger of losing that. Indeed, Donald Trump has embraced white supremacists by retweeting their accounts on his own Twitter feed and using rhetoric that appeals to them.In fact, despite his attempt to paint Democrats as the real racist fascists in this election, Trump is actually the candidate that white nationalists are drawn to. Virtually every alt-right Nazi I know is volunteering for the Trump campaign,  said white nationalist Andrew Anglin.David Duke, the former KKK leader who is running for the U.S. Senate in Louisiana, bragged to the Times that Trump is where he is because of white supremacists.  Trump happened because of us,  Duke said,  not the other way around. The fact that Donald Trump s doing so well, it proves that I m winning,  Duke continued.  I am winning. And if David Duke wins, it means the Nazis and the KKK win, too.So are we as Americans really prepared to let the Nazis take over the United States? Because if they do, they ll have control of the greatest military on the planet and we need to remember that when Hitler and the Nazis took power in Germany the first nation they conquered was their own and it resulted in concentration camps, indoctrination, loss of rights, and the eventual destruction of the entire nation. We can stop this new generation of Nazis from gaining power in the United States simply by making sure Trump loses by a landslide in November. If not, we may end up needing a coalition of nations to liberate us one day and that means World War III.Donald Trump and his white nationalist supporters need to be stopped before it is too late.Featured Image: Twitter",Fake
" Married GOP Lawmaker And Trump Campaign Member BUSTED In Hotel With Teenage Boy As if Donald Trump needs help delegitimizing his party, a senior member of his campaign in Oklahoma, state Senator Ralph Shortey, was forced to resign after being caught in a hotel room with a 17-year-old male prostitute.In true Trump style, Shortey tried to spin the encounter as him just helping the kid earn some money for his Spring Break by letting the kid earn his way with  sexual stuff. In online messages, he told him:  I m gonna f**k you like a good little boy if you keep calling me daddy. He also referred to having sex with the teen s  boy p*ssy, baby boy .Source: Pink NewsAccording to court documents, Shortey was reported by a friend of the boy, who saw him getting into an SUV. The friend followed them to the hotel room, where he saw the boy enter with a strange man. The friend called the teen s father, who called the police.While the age of consent in Oklahoma is only 16, having sex with a prostitute under 18 is something else altogether. Shortey has been charged with engaging in child prostitution, engaging in prostitution within 1,000 feet of a church and transporting a minor for prostitution. All the charges are felonies. He s out on $100,000 bail.Here s the video:Shortey s statement following resignation fell short of admitting to his crimes, instead calling them  a distraction. Earlier today, I submitted my resignation, effective immediately, to the President Pro Tempore of the Oklahoma Senate, as well as to Governor Fallin. I thank the constituents of Senate District 44 for the opportunity they provided to serve. Because I take that responsibility seriously, I recognize that the charges against me are a distraction to their interests and the remaining legislative session, which should serve all Oklahomans. My resignation is evidence of my respect for public service and the duties of our elected officials. I ask for the privacy of my family   my wife and four daughters   as I defend myself of these charges.Source: KFOR ",Fake
"Second court rejects Trump bid to stop transgender military recruits WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal appeals court in Washington on Friday rejected a bid by President Donald Trumpâ€™s administration to prevent the U.S. military from accepting transgender recruits starting Jan. 1, the second court to issue such a ruling this week. Four federal judges around the country have issued injunctions blocking Trumpâ€™s ban on transgender people from the military, including one that was also handed down on Friday. The administration has appealed the previous three rulings. In a six-page order, the three-judge-panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said the administration had â€œnot shown a strong likelihood that they will succeed on the merits of their challengeâ€ to a district courtâ€™s order blocking the ban. On Thursday the Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said it was denying the administrationâ€™s request while the appeal proceeds. The two courtsâ€™ actions could prompt the administration to ask the conservative-majority U.S. Supreme Court to intervene. Also on Friday, a federal trial court in Riverside, California, blocked the ban while the case proceeds, making it the fourth to do so, after similar rulings in Baltimore, Seattle and Washington, D.C. U.S. District Judge Jesus Bernal said without the injunction the plaintiffs, including current and aspiring service members, would suffer irreparable harm. â€œThere is nothing any court can do to remedy a government-sent message that some citizens are not worthy of the military uniform simply because of their gender,â€ he added. The administration had argued that the Jan. 1 deadline for accepting transgender recruits was problematic because tens of thousands of personnel would have to be trained on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants, and the military was not ready for that. The Obama administration had set a deadline of July 1, 2017, to begin accepting transgender recruits, but Trumpâ€™s defense secretary, James Mattis, postponed that date to Jan. 1. In an August memorandum, Trump gave the military until March 2018 to revert to a policy prohibiting openly transgender individuals from joining the military and authorizing their discharge. The memo also halted the use of government funds for sex-reassignment surgery for active-duty personnel. ",Real

It is now clear that she won it by a margin larger than two candidates who went on to win the presidency.David Leonhardt, a columnist for The New York Times, noted on Friday that with a 1.7-percentage-point popular vote lead over Donald Trump,Clinton will have a larger margin of victory than Richard Nixon had over Hubert Humphrey in 1968 or John F. Kennedy had over Nixon in 1960. (Her edge is also larger than Al Gore s popular vote victory over George W. Bush in 2000, though he too was stymied by an electoral college loss.)In raw numbers, that amounts to an edge of roughly 1.8 million votes as of Saturday.The election is decided by the electoral college, not the popular vote, so Trump will be sworn in to the presidency. But it s telling that even in victory, Trump s supporters must lie to themselves and each other with these completely made up stories. It shows that, despite the claim that the left is in a  bubble  on the coasts, the Trump supporters are the ones who have sealed themselves off from the real world where 2 is always bigger than 1.Featured image via Flickr",Fake
" Trump Just Met With Airline Execs, RUINS Meeting With INSANELY Unpresidential Rant (VIDEO) Donald Trump has turned yet another meeting in which he should have been focusing on being America s president and getting sh*t done into an absolute circus and embarrassment.During a meeting with airline executives, Trump decided that he was bored and could no longer focus, so he went on a completely incoherent rant about things his personal pilot had told him. As you can imagine, everyone in the room was shocked as Trump continued to hijack the meeting and went on babbling, making it impossible to actually get anything accomplished until he was finished.According to the White House pool report, Trump commended airlines for succeeding  despite the bad equipment that the airport gives you, in many cases.  Then he started complaining about the equipment, stating that he had  a pilot who s a real expert  who once told him that airlines are often given  the wrong stuff.  Trump continued: Let s order the right equipment. Probably the wrong equipment cost more. Here are some more gems from his rant: We want the traveling public to have the greatest customer service and with an absolute minimum of delays. We spent six trillion dollars in the Middle East, we got nothing. And we have an obsolete plane system, we have obsolete airports. As you can imagine, most of this rant made zero sense. This has become a pattern for Trump   he continues to meet with industry CEOs, but he doesn t actually accomplish anything. He doesn t tackle policy, and he spends most of his time talking about himself or complaining. This shouldn t be too surprising, considering that we elected a former reality television star who knows NOTHING about policy, so he s obviously doing whatever he can to pass the time in these meetings.You can watch Trump go completely off track in the meeting below:Read more:Featured image via Win McNamee / Getty Images",Fake
" Lawrence Oâ€™Donnell Is Trolling Bill Oâ€™Reilly Over His Sexual Harassment Scandals; Itâ€™s BRILLIANT (TWEET) In the age of Donald Trump, it seems that Twitter is ground zero for public spats, public shaming, and all sorts of back and forth exchanges.

He tweeted:O Reilly threatens to sue Wendy Walsh for ""defamation of Mr O'Reilly's character."" Sue me too because I believe her. https://t.co/jQ3y3mUvbM  Lawrence O'Donnell (@Lawrence) April 4, 2017That isn t all O Donnell did, either.

" Republicans Declare WAR On The Poor, Go After Food Stamps, Medical Coverage Donald Trump has won the White House and now, Republicans have control of the Senate and Congress, too. House Speaker Paul Ryan has hinted at plans to privatize Medicare. Ryan s Ayn Randish vision for America has been well documented with his plans to slash the safety net while giving a big middle finger to the middle and lower-income classes.Yes, this is a war. One in which Americans will suffer greatly. Millions of low-income Americans on Medicaid could lose their health coverage if Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress follow through with their plans.Vox reports that Trump has: already endorsed Ryan s plans on Medicaid and has attacked food stamps at length. His vice president, Mike Pence, is a longtime friend and congressional ally of Ryan s who if anything has argued for larger cuts than the ones Ryan wants.We can expect an increase in poverty. I ve been working on these issues since 1972,  Robert Greenstein, the founder and president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and Washington s leading advocate for poor and low-income Americans, said, according to Vox.  This is by far the gravest threat to the safety net, and to low-income people, that I ve seen in my close to half a century of working on these issues. I think there s a potential in the first seven months, by the August recess, for Congress to pass policies that do more to increase poverty and hardship and widen inequality than we ve seen in half a century. If Obamacare is repealed without a viable replacement, 22 million people will be denied coverage.Paul Ryan, like his conservative colleagues, seeks fewer regulations for insurance companies. Insurance companies would offer worse policies and the quality of care would go down.Trump s replacement plan is even worse than Ryan s.The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates it d spare just 1 million people who d otherwise lose insurance through Obamacare repeal. Full repeal without replacement takes insurance away from 22 million; Trump s plan takes it away from 21 million. The difference is minimal.And yet, here s the thing. Trump has already broken numerous campaign promises and he s not even in office yet. He has suggested that he won t fully repeal Obamacare but now, he s beholden to Republicans who control the Senate and the House. Even if he says no, the wheels are in motion. He s the one who started turning them.Because eating while poor is bad:CBPP estimates that the most recent House budget gets 62 percent of its cuts from programs for low- and moderate-income people. That includes at least $150 billion in cuts to food stamps and nearly $500 billion in mostly unspecified cuts to other low-income programs like SSI (which provides cash to the disabled and elderly), Pell Grants, and what little remains of welfare.Republicans have been trying to eradicate President Obama s signature healthcare legislation so it was watered down. Tea Party Republicans went to town halls where Democrats attempted to answer questions from constituents. The noise from Republicans was deafening and hardly a word could be heard about the bill. So, it got watered down because conservatives told us that socialism is bad. They told us this after driving to the town hall meetings on taxpayer funded public roads.As it happens, medical professionals do not want Obamacare repealed. Trump and his Republican colleagues just want you to think that.Featured image via Zach Gibson/Getty Images",Fake

" Heckler Screams â€˜F*ck Hillaryâ€™ At Clinton Rally â€“ And She Just Laughs At Him (VIDEO) Sometimes you ve got to laugh   especially if you re the Democratic nominee, who is currently facing down a level of unbridled hatred that rivals all previous presidential candidates with the exception of Barack Obama. Recently, Hillary contracted pneumonia   or, if you listen to our friends on the Right, she s on her deathbed and completely unfit to serve as President because reasons. The downright comical reaction to this, coupled with the numerous right-wing anti-Hillary witch hunts like Benghazi and the manufactured controversy over her emails, is enough to give one a chuckle   but it s even more fun when one of the ignoramuses who subscribe to such ridiculous notions stops by one of her rallies to tell the Democratic nominee how he really feels about her.As Hillary spoke to a crowd in Greensboro, North Carolina, a heckler screamed: F*ck Hillary. Hillary s reaction was priceless. As the crowd cheered for her and  Hillary  chants broke out, a grin formed on the face of the former Secretary of State, quickly turning into a chuckle then a full-blown laugh. Now, I just want to have a conversation and other people can wave their arms and their signs,  she said after the moment passed, going back into her speech like nothing happened as the heckler was escorted out.Interestingly, she didn t order her supporters to attack the man. She didn t lash out, she didn t insult him. She respected his right to display a dissenting opinion.

" WTF? Trump Demanded Comeyâ€™s â€˜Loyaltyâ€™ At Private Dinner President Donald Trump told his account of a private dinner he had with James Comey to Lester Holt but now it appears a lot more happened that he didn t mention and a lot of what he said went on, didn t.According to Trump, the dinner was set for Comey to ask to keep his job. On its face, this is farcical. The FBI Director is appointed for terms of ten years so Comey didn t have to ask Trump to stay on. Secondly, Trump claims he asked Comedy about any investigation into the president and that the answer was,  You are not under investigation.  That doesn t make any more sense.Comey s side of the story is a lot different. According to the New York Times,  As they ate, the president and Mr. Comey made small talk about the election and the crowd sizes at Mr. Trump s rallies. The president then turned the conversation to whether Mr. Comey would pledge his loyalty to him. When Comey refused to offer such a pledge, Trump persisted. While Comey did say he would be honest with Trump, the New York Times is reporting that,  Mr. Comey declined to make that pledge. Instead, Mr. Comey has recounted to others, he told Mr. Trump that he would always be honest with him, but that he was not  reliable  in the conventional political sense. Loyalty has always been super important to Trump throughout his life. As a businessman, it makes sense. You need to know that your proprietary information is going to stay private. When you are the leader of the United States (or any other country), this is not the same thing. It reeks of dictatorship.Of course, the White House is pushing back hard on the claims that the dinner in question was not the way Comey describes it. That is not surprising.

"Green groups sue Trump administration over delay of methane rule WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A coalition of nearly 20 environmental and Native American tribal groups sued the Trump administration on Tuesday, challenging its delay of a rule limiting emissions of the powerful greenhouse gas methane from oil and gas drilling operations on federal lands. Earlier this month, the Bureau of Land Management, part of the Department of the Interior, suspended implementation of the rule for a year, until Jan. 17, 2019, saying it wanted to avoid compliance costs for energy companies as it revises the regulation. The delay â€œis yet another action taken by the Trump administration to benefit the oil and gas industry at the expense of the American public, particularly the millions of Westernersâ€ who use public lands for ranching, hunting, hiking and other purposes, Darin Schroeder, a lawyer with the Clean Air Task Force, said in a statement. His organization represented the National Wildlife Federation, one of the groups that filed the lawsuit against Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and his department. Energy companies say the rule, finalized at the end of the Obama administration in 2016, could cost them tens of thousands of dollars per well.  The Trump administration is expected to announce a new draft rule in coming weeks, in line with its policy of maximizing output of oil, gas and coal and dismantling regulations it says prevent job growth.  The rule targets accidental leaks and intentional venting of methane from drilling operations on public lands, where about 9 percent of the countryâ€™s natural gas and 5 percent of its oil were produced last fiscal year. Some of its 2017 provisions have already been phased in, but the majority of them have yet to go into effect. The lawsuit, also filed by the Sierra Club, the Environmental Defense Council, and the DinÃ© Citizens Against Ruining Our Environment, a Navajo group, seeks to stop the delay and force the Interior Department to implement the rule in January. It was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in San Francisco.  The Interior Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit. ",Real
"Virginia court rules for Trump in travel ban dispute, order still halted (Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge in Virginia ruled on Friday that President Donald Trumpâ€™s travel ban was justified, increasing the likelihood the measure will go before the Supreme Court as the decision took an opposing view to courts in Maryland and Hawaii that have halted the order. U.S. District Court Judge Anthony Trenga rejected arguments by Muslim plaintiffs who claimed Trumpâ€™s March 6 executive order temporarily banning the entry of all refugees and travelers from six Muslim-majority countries was discriminatory.  The decision went against two previous court rulings that put an emergency halt to the order before it was set to take effect on March 16. The order remains halted. Trump has said he plans to appeal those unfavorable rulings to the U.S. Supreme Court if needed, and differing opinions by lower courts give more grounds for the highest court to take up the case.    Trenga, an appointee of Republican President George W. Bush, said the complaint backed by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), a Muslim civil rights group, found that more than 20 individuals who brought the suit had been able to show they were harmed by the travel ban since they might be unable to reunite with their relatives. But he also ruled that Trumpâ€™s revised order, which replaced  a more sweeping version signed on Jan. 27 and rejected by courts, fell within the presidentâ€™s authority to make decisions about immigration.  He said that since the order did not mention religion, the court could not look behind it at Trumpâ€™s statements about a â€œMuslim banâ€ to determine what was in the â€œdrafterâ€™s heart of hearts.â€  Trump has said the ban is necessary to protect the country from terrorist attacks, but his first order was halted by a federal judge in Seattle and a U.S. appeals court in San Francisco due to concerns it violated the U.S. Constitutionâ€™s prohibition against religious bias.    â€œWeâ€™re confident that the presidentâ€™s fully lawful and necessary action will ultimately be allowed to move forward through the rest of the court systems,â€ said White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer at a briefing. CAIR said it would appeal the decision to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Lena Masri, CAIRâ€™s national litigation director, said the 4th Circuit and the Supreme Court â€œare the judicial bodies that will ultimately decide whether the Constitution protects the rights of Muslim Americans.â€ A ruling by U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Hawaii - an appointee of Democratic President Barack Obama - put a stop to the two central sections of the revised ban that blocked travelers from six countries and refugees, while leaving other parts of the order in place.  U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang in Maryland, also an Obama appointee, only put a halt to the section on travelers. The Virginia lawsuit sought to strike down the revised ban in its entirety.  Watson scheduled a hearing for Wednesday to decide whether his temporary order blocking the travel and refugee restrictions should be converted into a more formal preliminary injunction. The Justice Department has said it would oppose that bid.  The government has appealed Chuangâ€™s decision in Maryland, also to the 4th circuit, and a hearing in that case is scheduled for May 8.  Other lawsuits against the ban continue to move forward around the country. Also on Friday, the Southern Poverty Law Center and other groups filed a new complaint in U.S. District Court in Washington D.C. on behalf of Muslim community organizations. ",Real
" Bombshell Report Reveals What Comey REALLY Thought Of Trump By now, the whole world knows that the investigation into Donald Trump and his campaign s ties to Russia is likely what led to the firing of FBI Director James Comey. However, new reporting also reveals that Comey really didn t think much of Trump in the first place. According to a report in The Week, Comey had expressed concern about Trump s temperament as it related to the presidency and the leadership of the nation. He allegedly told confidantes that Trump is  crazy  and  outside the realm of normal. Like the rest of the sane people in America, Comey also seemed to believe that Trump s lack of self restraint and his impulsive and reckless statements on Twitter were a danger to the nation. Further, it seems that Trump was angry with Comey on several occasions as well. When Comey testified in open Congressional hearing that there was no evidence to corroborate Trump s claim that President Obama wiretapped Trump Tower, Trump was incensed. The same is true of Comey s refusal to pledge loyalty to Trump instead of the United States Constitution.Daniel C. Richman, a close adviser to Comey, says of the situation: With a president who seems to prize personal loyalty above all else and a director with absolute commitment to the Constitution and pursuing investigations wherever the evidence led, a collision was bound to happen. Indeed. And that is the problem: Trump doesn t give a damn about the Constitution or the rule of law; in fact, he seems to only care for himself and what benefits him and makes him look good. He doesn t care about the American people, or the nation. This whole sorry excuse for a  presidency  is nothing more than the ultimate reality show for an incompetent, unfit fool with the biggest ego in the world. Unfortunately, we re all paying the price.Featured image via Andrew Harrer-Pool/Getty Images",Fake
"Trump to meet with top executives on wireless tech, drones WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will discuss advanced wireless technologies and drones on Thursday with top executives at AT&T Inc, Verizon Communications Inc, T-Mobile US Inc and other firms, focusing on how government can create the right environment for breakthroughs. AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson, Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure and CenturyLink Inc CEO Glen Post will be among the executives discussing advanced technologies such as unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, 5G wireless technologies and universal broadband, officials said. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Trump will see â€œdemonstrations of how these technologies will contribute to the 21st century economy and how the government can ensure that their safe adoption leads to the best possible outcomes for the American worker and American businesses.â€ Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai, Deputy Chief Technology Officer Michael Kratsios, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, White House National Economic Director Gary Cohn and FAA and NASA officials will attend small group meetings before the group meets with Trump at about 11 a.m. EDT (1500 GMT). Venture capital firms and portfolio companies also are expected. Last year, the FCC cleared the way for 5G, a lightning-fast next generation of wireless services that lead to universal access to broadband wireless. Testing is under way and deployment is expected around 2020. New 5G networks are expected to provide speeds at least 10 times and maybe 100 times faster than todayâ€™s 4G networks, the FCC said. Policymakers and mobile phone companies have said the next generation of wireless signals needs to be much faster and far more responsive to allow advanced technologies such as virtual surgery or controlling machines remotely. They face regulatory hurdles to adding infrastructure to create the system. The 5G networks could help wirelessly connect devices such as thermostats or washing machines to facilitate the â€œinternet of things.â€ They could improve road traffic by monitoring sensors in streetlights and cars. It could even help detect air pollution using sensors in trees. The FAA in March estimated that by 2021 the fleet of small hobbyist drones will more than triple and the commercial drone fleet will increase tenfold to about 442,000. The Obama administration implemented rules that opened the skies to low-level small drones for education, research and routine commercial use. The Trump administration still is considering whether to allow a sweeping expansion in drone use for purposes such as deliveries where aircraft would fly beyond the sight of an operator. ",Real

" Republicans In This State Just Sent A Huge â€˜F**K YOU!â€™ To Workers AND Democracy With One Terrible Move It s the lame duck session for Ohio s legislature, which means they re going bananas pushing  Christmas tree  bills   and measures added to bills   through before their term ends. This process tends to favor the majority party, which is the Republican Party, and they ve already made headlines for two unconstitutionally restrictive anti-abortion bills, as well as an aptly-named  guns everywhere  bill.And that s still not enough for Ohio Republicans. In their latest act of legislative war, they ve taken aim at labor and local democracy. How? By adding a measure banning local municipalities from raising the minimum wage to a bill against bestiality, of all things. Governor Kasich has not yet stated whether or not he will sign, but Republican legislators are optimistic.It should be noted that an anti-bestiality bill passed the Ohio Senate with bipartisan support earlier in the term.This measure appears mostly aimed at the city of Cleveland, which is about to vote on whether to raise the minimum wage locally to $15 over the next few years. A local group in Cincinnati, Cincinnatians for a Strong Economy, wants to do the same.Republicans generally claim to be in favor of local government   after all, who knows the needs of a given city or state better than the people that live there? However, incidents like this have made it clear that individual matters of ideological concern trump  principles  every time in the GOP.It should be noted that this is merely coming from a place of ideological support and politics   there is absolutely no evidence that banning cities from raising the minimum wage is good for the economy. See, until 2012, only five local districts in the entire country had minimum wage laws. Since then, dozens more have followed suit, allowing for numerous case studies on whether or not a local minimum wage raise  kills jobs,  as Republicans claim, as opposed to accomplishing that dastardly progressive agenda of keeping workers out of poverty.In many cases, large cities   which typically have higher cost-to-live and unique economic considerations   are a better choice for a minimum wage raise than an entire state, anyway. Take Seattle, for example, which saw the nation s first $15 minimum wage law (although San Francisco will get there faster):As one of my colleagues wrote last week, the  unemployment rate in the city of Seattle   the tip of the spear when it comes to minimum wage experiments   has now hit a new cycle low of 3.4%.  Meanwhile, a University of Washington study on the minimum wage law found little or no evidence of job losses or business closings.Although you can never declare a game over until the final whistle, this experiment is starting to look like a rout. I continue to believe that we should assess the data as it comes in, honestly and as free of bias as possible. This is a complex issue   Seattle, with its vibrant tech industry, high median household income and growing population, is different from many U.S. cities. States and cities must adjust their minimum wages to fit their local conditions; this is why a national minimum wage should rise at a pace different from the most economically vibrant locales.Taking away the ability of local cities to determine their own economic needs is bad policy, and allowing state officials to interfere in municipal democracy is undemocratic. Not only that, but workers deserve a raise. Minimum wage nationally is $7.25, frequently referred to as  poverty wages,  and the minimum wage in Ohio   $8.10   is not much higher. Republicans who are against welfare for human beings seem to have no trouble picking up the tab for deadbeat businesses that refuse to pay workers their fair share.From QZ:It could be that the fears of minimum wage opponents are overstated. One innovative 2015 study examined prices at online menus from local restaurants in San Jose, California, after the city enacted a 25% increase in minimum wages, and found that restaurants were able to accommodate higher costs of doing business through minor price increases. By looking at restaurants within a half-mile of the city s border, they were also able to demonstrate results  challenging the suggestion that local minimum wages disadvantage a city s economic competitiveness.  These experiments, however, have benefitted from the steady growth of the Obama economy, with its record 72 months of labor market expansion.With Donald Trump s presidency on the horizon, Democrats locked out of national influence will no doubt continue to press a progressive agenda locally, in the cities and states where they have more sway. But as wage floors rise, especially in jurisdictions with older or shrinking populations, they will have to be pragmatic about overreach, keeping in mind the lesson of Kansas  Republican governor Sam Brownback, who enacted a radical agenda in his state as an example to the nation a conservative one, rather than a progressive one, it should be noted and saw the local economy crumble.It s just a fact   liberals are better at managing the economy. That s what history and the facts show. This is undemocratic and anti-labor   in other words, everything the GOP stands for.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",Fake
"Comey talks 'real world,' meets protests at black university WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Protesters at Howard University chanted and booed on Friday through James Comeyâ€™s first public address since he testified to Congress about his firing by U.S. President Donald Trump, challenging the former FBI director with a taste of the â€œreal worldâ€ he was trying to describe to them. Students protesting the Federal Bureau of Investigationâ€™s treatment of black activists began chanting the civil rights song â€œWe Shall Not Be Movedâ€ as Comey stood at the podium, waiting out the demonstrators during a video about the historically black university in Washington, D.C.  The chants continued, intensifying and sometimes subsiding,  as Comey began his address, which focused on how he believed college campuses were very much a part of what he called the â€œreal world.â€ Comey did not ignore the shouts. â€œThe rest of the real world is a place where itâ€™s hard sometimes to find people who will listen with an attitude that they might actually be convinced of something,â€ he told them.  â€œInstead, what happens in most of the real world - and about four rows in this auditorium - is that people donâ€™t listen at all.â€ The protesters included HUResist, a Howard student social justice group that criticized Comeyâ€™s FBI for its treatment of Black Lives Matter activists.  â€œGet out James Comey, you ainâ€™t my homie!â€ students chanted before his address.  â€œWe will not let the voice and opinions of white supremacy live on this campus,â€ HUResist said on Twitter. Howard University officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Comey became a lightning rod for criticism from Democrats when he disclosed shortly before the November presidential election a new trove of emails involving the partyâ€™s candidate, Hillary Clinton. Many, including Clinton, said they believed this contributed to her loss to Republican Trump. In June congressional testimony, Comey accused the president of firing him in May to undermine the FBIâ€™s investigation of possible collusion by Trumpâ€™s campaign with Russia to influence the election. At Howard, Comey soldiered on with comments about a â€œreal worldâ€ that may have been veiled criticism of Trump, who touts the virtues of winning, but also were directed at the fury in front of him. â€œThey arenâ€™t looking to actually learn anything about you or about what you think,â€ he said. â€œItâ€™s a place where people take sides rather than trying to understand - are they still on the right side?

"U.S. seeks to dismiss lawsuit against Trump over foreign payments (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice on Friday called for the dismissal of a lawsuit alleging President Donald Trump violated the constitution by accepting foreign payments at his hotels. The lawsuit, filed in January, said Trump violates the Constitutionâ€™s â€œemolumentsâ€ clause, which bars him from accepting gifts from foreign governments without congressional approval, by maintaining ownership over his business empire despite ceding day-to-day control to his sons. In a filing in Manhattan federal court on Friday, the justice department argued that the plaintiffs in the case - an ethics non-profit, restaurant group and hotel events booker - do not have legal standing to sue.  The government also said payments to Trumpâ€™s hotels do not qualify as a violation of the emoluments clause, which is intended to cover personal services performed by the president. â€œPlaintiffsâ€™ broad-brush claims effectively assert that the Constitution disqualifies the president from serving as president while maintaining ownership interests in his commercial businesses,â€ the department said in its court filing. A spokesman for ethics watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, one of the plaintiffs, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The lawsuit said businesses such as hotel bookers are injured when foreign governments try to â€œcurry favorâ€ with Trump by favoring his own enterprises. It said this had even occurred since Trump took office, when China granted him trademark rights after he pledged to honor the â€œOne Chinaâ€ policy of his White House predecessors. The DOJ on Friday said any payments to Trumpâ€™s restaurants in New York, a city with 24,000 restaurants, have not caused enough specific harm to plaintiffs to give them the ability to sue.   U.S. District Judge Ronnie Abrams, an appointee of former Democratic President Barack Obama, oversees the litigation.  ",Real
"Trump healthcare order could run afoul of retirement plan law (Reuters) - President Donald Trumpâ€™s plan to make it easier for small businesses to band together and buy stripped-down health insurance plans could violate a federal law governing employee benefit plans and will almost certainly be challenged in court, legal experts said. Trump signed an executive order on Thursday aimed at letting small businesses join nationwide associations for the purpose of buying large-group health plans that are not subject to coverage requirements of the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. Industry experts said Trumpâ€™s order could ultimately enable such associations to purchase insurance from states with the fewest regulations. That would undermine Obamacare, former Democratic President Barack Obamaâ€™s signature healthcare law, which Republicans have failed to repeal. Several healthcare and employment law experts said if Trumpâ€™s plan moves forward, states could argue the federal government had overstepped its authority in violation of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), a law that governs large-group plans. In Thursdayâ€™s order, Trump asked the Department of Labor to propose rules that would allow more employers to participate in association health plans. Legal experts said lawsuits might not be brought until such regulations are issued. Dania Palanker, an assistant research professor at Georgetown Universityâ€™s Center on Health Insurance Reforms, said ERISA granted states the right to regulate association health plans.  Attorneys general could argue the federal government had overreached if the Trump administration winds up allowing associations to buy health coverage across borders that only complies with a single stateâ€™s regulations.  â€œAny attempt to allow the sale of association plans to small groups across state lines will be open to legal scrutiny as to whether it is violating ERISA and undermining state authority,â€ said Palanker. A White House official said that â€œdepartments will be drafting rules in a way that minimizes litigation risk.â€ The Department of Labor â€œwill be reviewing ERISA in the course of following the Presidentâ€™s directionâ€ in the order, the official said. A number of state attorneys general from Democratic-leaning states said on Thursday they would fight any efforts to weaken Obamacare, which extended health insurance to 20 million Americans, but which Republicans call intrusive and ineffective. â€œIt should come as no surprise that California is prepared to fight in court to protect affordable healthcare for its people,â€ said Xavier Becerra, the stateâ€™s Democratic attorney general. Legal experts said states may argue the associations formed for the purpose of buying insurance are not employers under ERISA. Although ERISA allows associations to qualify as employers and manage large-group plans, federal regulators have generally required that members of such associations have a high degree of common interest beyond buying insurance, said Allison Hoffman, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Law. Trumpâ€™s order asks the secretary of labor, who enforces ERISA, to consider expanding the common-interest requirements to permit broader participation in association health plans. SHORT-TERM PLANS The idea of expanding association health plans across state lines has long been championed by Republican U.S. Senator Rand Paul, who made it a key plank of his own proposal to repeal and replace Obamacare. The Kentucky Republican was at Trumpâ€™s side when the president signed the executive order. Paulâ€™s proposal said ERISA was too restrictive in its definition of associations and that the law needed to be amended.  Thursdayâ€™s order also asked the Labor, Treasury and Health and Human Services Departments to look into expanding participation in cheaper, bare-bones, short-term limited-duration insurance plans, which are not subject to the ACA. Timothy Jost, a professor at the Washington and Lee University School of Law, said such a move would face fewer legal hurdles than the expansion of association health plans. The current three-month limitation on the use of such plans was a rule adopted by the Obama administration last year, so the Trump administration could roll it back through the normal rulemaking process. Such plans are typically marketed to individuals who are between jobs or have a gap in coverage. They are much cheaper than ACA plans, but cover less and can exclude those with pre-existing conditions.  ",Real
"Trump signs order aimed at upgrading government cyber defenses WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday to bolster the governmentâ€™s cyber security and protect critical infrastructure from cyber attacks, marking his first significant action to address what he has called a top priority. The order seeks to improve the often-maligned network security of U.S. government agencies, from which foreign governments and other hackers have pilfered millions of personal records and other forms of sensitive data in recent years. The White House said the order also aimed to enhance protection of infrastructure such as the energy grid and financial sector from sophisticated attacks that officials have warned could pose a national security threat or cripple parts of the economy. The directive, which drew largely favorable reviews from cyber experts and industry groups, also lays out goals to develop a more robust cyber deterrence strategy, in part by forging strong cooperation with U.S. allies in cyberspace. White House homeland security adviser Tom Bossert said the order sought to build on efforts undertaken by the former Obama administration.  Among the notable changes, heads of federal agencies must use a framework developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology to assess and manage cyber risk, and prepare a report within 90 days documenting how they will implement it. The Obama administration had encouraged the private sector to adopt the voluntary NIST framework. But it did not require government agencies to do so, which opened it up to criticism as it frequently scrambled to respond to major hacks, such as the theft of more than 20 million personnel records from the Office of Personnel Management. Government agencies would now â€œpractice what they preach,â€ Bossert told reporters during a White House briefing. â€œA lot of progress was made in the last administration, but not nearly enough.â€ Michael Daniel, who served as White House cyber security coordinator under former Democratic President Barack Obama, generally praised the order but said it was largely â€œa plan for a plan.â€ Trump, a Republican, has also asked agencies to review their federal workforceâ€™s cyber talent, an area where the government has faced a growing shortfall of qualified personnel in recent years. The order calls for an examination of the impact of moving agencies toward a shared information technology environment, such as through cloud computing services. It also urges voluntary cooperation with the private sector to develop better strategies to fend off and reduce attacks from botnets, or  networks of infected devices. Trump nearly signed a cyber security measure just days into his presidency in January, but it was pulled back to allow for more input from federal agencies and consultation with experts. Before taking office, Trump said he intended to make cyber security a priority of his administration. But he has raised alarm among cyber security experts by frequently using a personal Twitter that could be hacked by an adversary. His skepticism of the conclusion by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia hacked Democratic emails during the election to help him win has drawn criticism. Russia has repeatedly denied assertions it used cyber means to meddle in the U.S. election. Bossert said Russiaâ€™s alleged hacks were not a motivation for the order, adding that â€œthe Russians are not our only adversary on the internet.â€ ",Real

International outrage ensued as people and governments around the globs condemned the ban and protests raged across the country.On Sunday, Trump watched the Disney/Pixar film in the White House as the protests continued and apparently learned nothing from watching it.So on Tuesday, DeGeneres told Trump what he should have learned. I don t get political, so I m not gonna talk about the travel ban,  DeGeneres began.  I m just gonna talk about the very nonpolitical, family-friendly, People s Choice Award-winning Finding Dory. DeGeneres explained that the character of Dory lives in the ocean near Australia, but she decides to travel to America to find her parents, whom she remembers after getting her memory jogged. Dory and her friends reach California, only to find a wall standing in their way and they proceed to do what is necessary to get around the obstacle.Finding Dory is about a fish named Dory and Dory lives in Australia. These are here parents. They live in America. I don t know what religion they are but her dad sounds a little Jewish. Doesn t matter! Dory arrives in America with her friends Marlin and Nemo and she ends up at the Marine Life Institute behind a large wall. They all have to get over the wall and you won t believe it but that wall has almost no effect in keeping them out.   Even though Dory gets into America, she gets separated from her family. Other animals help Dory   animals that don t even need her, animals that don t have anything in common with her. They help her even though they re completely different colors because that s what you do when you see someone in need. You help them.Here s the video via YouTube.Indeed, walls are a main obstacle throughout the movie, but the characters find a way to circumvent them every time, just as immigrants are going to circumvent Trump s massive and expensive wall along the southern border.As the Berlin Wall teaches us, people will find a way no matter how deadly the risks are.At least 5,000 people entered West Germany across the heavily guarded wall to escape the tyranny of the Soviet Union. 138 people died trying.If people are desperate enough, they will find a way to live in America.

" US Experiences Surge In Hate-Based Incidents Since Trumpâ€™s Election, Particularly On College Campuses Since Donald Trump s November 8 election victory, there has been a significant rise in hate-based threats and attacks in the United States, with the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) documenting 1,863 such incidents between then and April, at least 330 of which took place on college campuses. In fact, in the 10 days following the election, there was an average of 87 incidents per day!At the peak of these occurrences immediately following the election, there was a 500 percent spike in bias-based incidents when compared to daily hate crimes reported by the FBI for all of 2015. To be completely honest, these types of incidents have decreased slightly in recent months, but the most troubling part of this whole situation is the increase in the severity of the attacks.What makes these incidents even more frightening is the sheer amount that occur on college campuses, thanks mostly to an upsurge in white supremacists campaigning and recruiting in American colleges. It is getting so bad that the SPLC has documented more than 135 incidents of white supremacist and nationalist recruitment efforts on US campuses since the commencement of the 2016 academic year. It s a definite uptick, and they ve been making a concerted effort to flyer and paper as many campuses as they possibly can,  says Lecia Brooks, the SPLC s outreach director, adding that the campaigning has notably increased since Trump s Presidential victory. It shouldn t be hidden,  Brooks said in reference to incidents documented at schools across the entire country.  The [university] administrations should always issue a strong statement of condemnation clearly stating who they [white supremacist groups] are and what they represent, encouraging students to disregard their recruitment [drives] and disavow their message. The result of these recruitment efforts is a huge escalation in hate-based incidents on college campuses, including Tommy Curry, an African-American philosophy professor at Texas A&M University, constantly receiving death threats via email and voice messages, the stabbing death of Richard W Collins, an African-American Bowie State University student, while visiting the University of Maryland and the election of Taylor Dumpson, American University in Washington DC s first African-American, female student-government president, being met with nooses tied around the campus with bananas labeled  Harambe Bait.  And those are only the tip of the iceberg. I think the most threatening part is that we re beginning to see this rise up again because people feel comfortable and they feel empowered to have these kinds of beliefs, and that s terrifying,  Dumpson said.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images",Fake
"House intelligence panel leaders split over session on Russia WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The partisan divide over the House Intelligence Committeeâ€™s probe of Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election deepened on Friday, when the committeeâ€™s top Democrat suggested  its Republican chairman canceled a public hearing after pressure from the White House. Panel chairman Devin Nunes said he had to cancel next Tuesdayâ€™s hearing with officials from former Democratic President Barack Obamaâ€™s administration in order to have a classified briefing with the directors of the National Security Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation. â€œThe committee seeks additional information ... that can only be addressed in closed session,â€ Representative Nunes told reporters. FBI Director James Comey and NSA head Admiral Mike Rogers testified at a public hearing on Monday at which Comey confirmed for the first time that the FBI is investigating possible ties between Republican President Donald Trumpâ€™s campaign as Moscow sought to influence the 2016 election. Representative Adam Schiff, the intelligence committeeâ€™s top Democrat, said the cancellation was not in the public interest. â€œI think that there must have been a very strong pushback from the White House about the nature of Mondayâ€™s hearing. Itâ€™s hard for me to come to any other conclusion about why an agreed upon hearing would be suddenly canceled,â€ Schiff told a separate news conference.  The scheduled witnesses, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, former Central Intelligence Agency Director John Brennan and former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, were in office when the purported hacking and disinformation by Russia to influence the election took place. Russia has denied allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that it sought to influence the election, and Trump, a Republican, has said the controversy was cooked up by Democrats and fanned by hostile media. Nunes also said on Friday that former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafortâ€™s lawyers told the committee that he is volunteering to be interviewed, and that the panel would work with his lawyers to decide whether the interview would be open or closed to the public. The New York Times reported last month Manafort was one of several Trump advisers whose contacts with Russian operatives were monitored by U.S. law enforcement and intelligence. Manafort, who was Trumpâ€™s campaign chairman for several months last year, dismissed the report, the newspaper said. Many Democrats, including Schiff, have questioned whether a committee led by Nunes, a close Trump ally who served on the presidentâ€™s transition team, can still be relied on to conduct a credible investigation. They have called for a special prosecutor or select committee. Nunes apologized to the intelligence panel on Thursday for announcing to the public and briefing Trump that U.S. intelligence may have swept up communications by Trump associates before telling the committee. Schiff said Democrats had no intention of giving up on the investigation. â€œFrom my point of view, that would be irresponsible of us. So, I think weâ€™re going to do our best to investigate this regardless of the obstacles weâ€™re encountering,â€ Schiff said. Trump, who in early March tweeted without giving evidence that Obama had wiretapped his campaign while the businessman competed against Democrat Hillary Clinton, said he was â€œsomewhat vindicatedâ€ by Nunesâ€™ statement about the surveillance.

Whether they came from Sarah Palin or Alex Jones, right-wing looney tunes were always a far cry from the truth. Today we have a new term for it: fake news. But we must always remember what it truly is: conspiracy theories.Now that the great and honorable President Obama leaves office tomorrow, let s remind the  economically anxious  red America:Congratulations on letting yourself be played for the last 8 years! It was quite a sight to behold, both sad and funny that teetered on the brink of near insanity. Hopefully, this will be a learning experience to turn off the TV, quit with the fake news, and apply some common sense, no?Considering they just elected the biggest conspiracy theorist around, one shouldn t get their hopes up.Now that Trump has already broken a slew of promises, watch as red state citizens still bitterly cling to their guns and bibles while finding a way to somehow blame Obama.It is nearly impossible to record how much money, time and brain cells Republicans lost being perpetually lied to by the likes of Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity, Ann Coulter, Alex Jones, Dinesh D Souza, Bill O Reilly, Michele Bachmann and the rest of the right-wing brigade.The fact that Republicans allowed their minds to be poisoned for nine years (counting the campaign in 2008) will have long lasting effects for generations to come and will continue to throughout the Trump presidency.President Obama got one thing wrong: there is a blue state America and a red state America. But it goes so much deeper than that. There s an alert America and an easily duped America. There s a truthful America and an untruthful America. Luckily, Democrats were the former, and sadly Republicans allowed themselves to be the latter.But it wasn t always like this. In January 2009, as President Obama prepared to take office, 71 percent of America came together to support the new incumbent. Then the power of talk radio prevailed, and America was to be utterly transformed, never to be the same again.President Obama will leave office with a 60 percent approval rating. Perhaps a chunk of the GOP electorate realizes they have been manipulated.Going forward, Democrats and progressives alike need to be cautious of what they share and believe. Allowing our disdain for Trump to border on conspiracy is a dangerous route to take.Be vigilant, but be smart.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",Fake
" Germanyâ€™s President Joins Chancellor Merkel In Sharp Criticism Of â€˜Irritatingâ€™ Trump Unlike the United States, Germany has both a President and a Chancellor. The President is nothing more than a figurehead, of course; it is Chancellor Angela Merkel actually runs the nation. At any rate, Germany s current President, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, has come out on television to tell everyone just how he feels about Donald Trump.Speaking to a German television host, President Steinmeier says that he is  irritated  by Trump. Of course, since Germany is a staunch ally of the United States, he was careful in his wording and quick to recognize the relationship between the two nations, especially during the crucial rebuilding of Europe in the post World War II era. Steinmerier says: Our economic development would not have happened without the Marshall Plan. In this respect, I advise us not to throw everything overboard, even though I admit that I am irritated about a lot of things. He went on to essentially say he knows that most Americans are just as horrified by Trump as he is: Not all of America has forgotten the transatlantic relationship, and therefore I believe that within American politics, there will be corrections made to what we are now seeing. Of course, this is how you rebuke someone without even mentioning their name. Further, these remarks should come as no surprise, since Trump and German Chanecellor Angela Merkel have long had a frosty relationship. Like decent people everywhere, she was appalled by Trump s campaign trail behavior, and things have only gotten worse since Trump took office. When Merkel visited the White House, Trump actually gave her a bill for NATO, apparently in an attempt to keep his promise that he d make our allies pay up before offering  our protection. He also had the audacity to joke about Merkel being wiretapped. And then of course, there was the fact that Trump was way out of his league at the G 20, the G 7 and NATO Summits.All in all, the world cannot wait to be rid of Trump. It s okay   neither can we.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",Fake
" Trump Supporters Threaten Bloody Rebellion And Assassination If They Lose On Election Day (DETAILS) President Obama should put the National Guard and other military units on standby on Election Day.Because if Trump supporters don t get the results they want, they are going to try to kill Hillary Clinton and anyone else standing in the way of their party taking over the government.The Boston Globe attended a Donald Trump rally in Ohio last week and talked to several suppporters of the Republican nominee about what they will do if their candidate loses.To them, however, the only way Trump can lose is if their is election fraud, which Trump has already accused Hillary Clinton of committing.In Pennsylvania in August, Trump declared that the only way he can lose is if Hillary Clinton cheats, thus setting the stage for massive complaints of election fraud if Hillary wins the election on November 8th, even by a landslide.Trump has made his crowd of middle-aged white supporters very angry and very paranoid.Scott Webb is taking his command from Trump to watch polling places very seriously. Trump said to watch your precincts,  the 61-year-old said.  I m going to go, for sure. I ll look for well, it s called racial profiling. Mexicans. Syrians. People who can t speak American. I m going to go right up behind them. I ll do everything legally. I want to see if they are accountable. I m not going to do anything illegal. I m going to make them a little bit nervous. In other words, Webb is going to try to intimidate anyone who doesn t have the same skin color as he does because Trump supporters believe that only minorities commit voter fraud.65-year-old Jeannine Bell Smith is already predicting unprecedented amounts of voter fraud this election even though it is very rare in this country. We re going to have a lot of election fraud,  she said.  They are having illegals vote. In some states, you don t need voter registration to vote. We can t have that lying bitch in the White House. Judy Wright doesn t care if Hillary wins in a squeaker or by a landslide.  If Hillary wins, it s rigged,  she said.  All I know is our country is not going to be a country anymore. I ve heard people talk about a revolution. I ve heard people talk about separation of states. I don t even like to think about it. But I don t think this movement is going away. We don t have a voice anymore, and Donald Trump is giving us a voice. Indeed, many Trump supporters are ready to overthrow the government and assassinate Hillary Clinton if Trump doesn t win. That s what 50-year-old Dan Bowman told the Boston Globe in the scariest quote they obtained. If she s in office, I hope we can start a coup. She should be in prison or shot. That s how I feel about it. We re going to have a revolution and take them out of office if that s what it takes. There s going to be a lot of bloodshed. But that s what it s going to take I would do whatever I can for my country. Donald Trump and his supporter are the most dangerous threat against America and our democracy. Trump has already called for  Second Amendment people  to do something about Hillary Clinton if she wins and nominates Supreme Court Justices that conservatives don t approve of. He has also called for her to be imprisoned.And his fanatical supporters are starting to foam at the mouth at the thought to attempting to violently overthrow the government.Even Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin has called for a bloody revolt if Trump doesn t win.Trump supporters claim they are oppressed, but that s just because they aren t allowed to oppress black people, gays, and Muslims. They literally think they are being oppressed because they can t legally oppress others.The fact is that if any Trump supporters who attempt a coup will be guilty of treason and should pay major consequences for their actions. That being said, the federal government and law enforcement need to take these threats seriously. We cannot not tolerate such an attack on our democracy and the peaceful transition of power that has existed in this country since its founding. So no matter how many votes Trump loses by, even if it comes down to a few thousand, Trump s supporters need to accept that they lost fair and square.Featured Image: Screenshot",Fake
"Trump invites leaders of Thailand, Singapore to the White House WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump spoke to the leaders of Thailand and Singapore on Sunday in separate phone calls about the security situation in the Asia-Pacific region at a time of rising tensions with North Korea and invited both to visit Washington, the White House said. Thailand Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former general, heads a military-dominated government that took power in a 2014 coup.

" Top Trump Advisor Admits Trump Is Small Minded And Vindictive If there s anyone in this country who s an expert in dirty politics, it s Donald Trump surrogate Roger Stone. Stone is a racist, a conspiracy theorist, misogynistic and pretty much everything ugly that comes out of the Trump camp. He s also intensely loyal to Trump, so if Stone says Trump was simply toying with Mitt Romney just to be a vindictive a**hole, well, you can pretty much take that to the bank.On Sunday, Stone appeared on InfoWars with Alex Jones. Jones and Stone are both conspiracy nuts, but what Stone told Jones was no conspiracy. According to Stone, Trump only interviewed Mitt Romney for the Secretary of State position to  torture him  for refusing to endorse the Orange Man. Donald Trump was interviewing Mitt Romney for Secretary of State in order to torture him,  Stone claimed on the program.  To toy with him. And given the history, that s completely understandable. Mitt Romney crossed a line. He didn t just oppose Trump, which is his democratic right, he called him a phony and a fraud. And a con man. And that s not the kind of man you want as Secretary of State. While Trump s official team hasn t confirmed or denied Stone s allegations, it s far from out of character for Trump, who seems to relish in vindictive retribution.Actual (we can t confirm or deny that Trump is a billionaire either) billionaire Richard Branson called Trump vindictive and dangerous.What concerns me most, based upon my personal experiences with Donald Trump, is his vindictive streak, which could be so dangerous if he got into the White House. For somebody who is running to be the leader of the free world to be so wrapped up in himself, rather than concerned with global issues, is very worrying.Trump has vowed to sue all the women who accused him of sexual misconduct. In fact, Trump threatens to sue everyone who crosses him. He cuts off media sources when they write negative things about him.A psychologist had this to say about Trump:Psychology research shows that vindictiveness is strongly correlated with narcissism, a personality trait that countless psychologists say Trump shows all the signs of having. Studies have also found that those who seek revenge are often very energetic and have dominant personalities. Further, vengeful people often seek powerful positions that allow them to inflict what they see as well-deserved hurt on their enemies. That pretty much describes Trump to a T.If, in fact, Trump did only invite Romney to meet with him to  torture him,  this is beyond troubling. We need an adult in the White House, not a proud schoolyard bully.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images.",Fake
" Mueller Just Told Trump To F*ck Off With His Threats, Expands Probe To Trump Family Finances On Wednesday, Donald Trump warned the special counsel investigating the Russia scandal not to look into his business or personal finances and that s exactly like saying,  Hey, Special Counsel Robert Mueller, look into my finances!  Well, that s just what happened. It s like after robbing a bank and the police stop you for running a red light, so you say,  Don t look in the trunk! So, as part of the probe into possible ties between the Donald Trump campaign and Russia in the 2016 presidential election, the Special Counsel is now is examining a broad range of transactions involving Trump s businesses as well as those of his associates, according to what a person familiar with the probe told Bloomberg.FBI investigators and others are looking at Russian purchases of apartments in Trump buildings, Trump s involvement in a controversial SoHo development in New York with Russian associates, the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow and Trump s sale of a Florida mansion to a Russian oligarch in 2008, the person said.The Trump Crime Family and Associates look like they re in deep sh*t:The investigation also has absorbed a money-laundering probe begun by federal prosecutors in New York into Trump s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort.Trump s lawyer, John Dowd, said on Thursday that the inquiry into Trump s businesses is  unrelated  to last year s election. Those transactions are in my view well beyond the mandate of the Special counsel; are unrelated to the election of 2016 or any alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia and most importantly, are well beyond any Statute of Limitation imposed by the United States Code,  he stated in an email.We disagree! There s a saying which goes like this:  Follow the money  and apparently, Mueller has heard that wise quote before. There s a way that Trump could clear this all up. It would require the sitting  president  to release his tax returns, you know, like all of his predecessors have done.By the way, if Trump s resort in Florida mysteriously catches fire and he says,  Don t look in the garage for propellant  then I m pretty sure they will look into the garage. Nevertheless, Trump didn t see this coming. Somehow.Photo by Ann Heisenfelt/Getty Images",Fake
" Russian Lobbyist Blows Jeff Sessionsâ€™ Story Right Out Of The Water As Attorney General, Jeff Sessions is the top law enforcement person in this country. He s also under investigation for colluding with the Russians and for lying about it. Let that sink in for just a moment.There s a new report out on Thursday, which, whether or not it is to be believed, is more bad news for Sessions.According to an article in The Guardian, an American lobbyist for Russian banking and oil interests claims that he had dinner with Sessions. This is in direct conflict to what Sessions claimed in front of the Senate just this week.Sessions testified under oath on Tuesday that he did not believe he had any contacts with lobbyists working for Russian interests over the course of Trump s campaign. But Richard Burt, a former ambassador to Germany during the Reagan administration, who has represented Russian interests in Washington, told the Guardian that he could confirm previous media reports that stated he had contacts with Sessions at the time. I did attend two dinners with groups of former Republican foreign policy officials and Senator Sessions,  Burt said.Burt, who previously served on the advisory board of Alfa Capital Partners, a private equity fund where Russia s Alfa Bank was an investor and last year was lobbying on behalf of a pipeline company that is now controlled by Gazprom, Russia s state-controlled energy conglomerate, first told Politico in October that he had been invited to two dinners that were hosted by Sessions last summer, at the height of the presidential campaign.There are two ways this could play out for Sessions. Either Burt is telling the truth, which is a possible smoking gun for perjury and obstruction, or he s lying. While Republicans seem to be operating under the assumption that Putin is holding them tight in his warm shirtless embrace, the truth is that Putin doesn t give a crap about Jeff Sessions, Donald Trump or Paul Ryan.Russia s goal is to destabilize the United States using the best tools at their disposal, and right now, Republicans are their biggest tools. That will change the moment the idiots prove they re no longer useful. Burt s statement could, even if not true, prove that Session s usefulness is done. Russia could be ready to turn on the Trump administration.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images.",Fake
" Megyn Kelly Called Trump A â€˜Predatorâ€™; What Newt Gingrich Said Next Was DISGUSTING (VIDEO) It s Fox News, but that doesn t mean that everyone is blindly following Donald Trump. Anchor Megyn Kelly fell off the Trump train right about the time of the first Republican presidential debate of the season, after which Trump accused Kelly of having  blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever,  all because she dared ask about Trump s history of sexism.It s been more than a year since that debate, and in that time, Trump the sexist has come front and center, especially after Trump was caught on a hot mic, saying that he likes to grab women  by the pussy,  and to confirm Trump s own words, nearly a dozen women are now accusing the self-described billionaire of sexual misconduct.Kelly, when interviewing Trump surrogate Newt Gingrich, suggested that Trump is a  sexual predator.  At that point, the interview went off the rails. Gingrich became very angry and said to Kelly,Kelly responded in the best way possible,  I m not fascinated by sex, but I am fascinated by the protection of women and what we are getting in the oval office. Every woman knows that when a man tells a woman she s  fascinated by sex,  he s not saying it in a way that means she d be welcome in Trump s locker room   not at all. When a man tells a woman she s  fascinated by sex,  especially in an argumentative context, he s calling her a whore. While that statement might not have the same bite in 2016 that it might have had when Gingrich was young, the intent is there. Gingrich is trying to discredit Kelly in the exact same way that Trump is trying to discredit his alleged victims. A woman liking sex is still used as a defense in rape trials. While men grabbing pussy, or talking about grabbing pussy, is just boys being boys. Women talking about sex is taboo and any woman who dares talk about sex deserve whatever they have coming to them.Believe it or not, that exchange was the most rational part. In the now familiar Trump tactic of  I know you are but what am I,  Gingrich went on to call Bill Clinton a  sexual predator.  He even tried subtly bullying Kelly into  say(ing) the words,  Bill Clinton sexual predator.' Kelly went on to say that on her show, they ve covered the Bill Clinton story and that she s interviewed Kathleen Willey, who has accused Clinton of rape (an accusation for which a grand jury found insufficient evidence).Here s the video:Gingrich has a grudge against Clinton, to be sure. If you recall, the former Speaker of the House was one of architects of the Clinton impeachment, which only served to boost Clinton s popularity while it seriously hurt Congress s.Ironically, Gingrich and the other two Speakers who presided during the impeachment investigation and trials, were all sexual predators. Dennis Hastert molested boys while a wrestling coach in Illinois and Bob Livingston had a string of affairs. Gingrich was cheating on his second wife. Before that, though, Gingrich earned the title of sexual predator, at least that s what he s accused of:One former aide describes approaching a car with Gingrich s daughters in hand, only to find the candidate with a woman, her head buried in his lap. The aide quickly turned and led the girls away. Another former friend maintains that Gingrich repeatedly made sexual advances to her when her husband was out of town. On one occasion, he visited under the guise of comforting her after the death of a relative, and instead tried to seduce her. In certain circles in the mid-1970s, Gingrich was developing a reputation as a ladies  man.Source: SalonOh, and he also served his first wife her divorce papers while she was recovering from cancer surgery. Yes, he and Trump are a perfect match.",Fake
" Robert De Niro Attends Charity Event, Tears Into That â€˜Motherf***erâ€™ Donald Trump Acclaimed actor Robert De Niro doesn t hold back when it comes to former reality show star Donald Trump and last night was no different. While appearing at the Annual Hudson River Park Gala in Manhattan, New York, the event saw the esteemed actor honored and a bench dedicated to him, according to The Independent. The seven-time Academy Award nominee, who also won two Oscars, tore into that  lowlife  Donald Trump and that was just the beginning. One of my pleasures will be keeping people off my bench who don t deserve a view of the park like Donald Trump,  he said during a speech. F k you, Donald Trump. It s a horror with this motherf er.  The  Good Fellas  actor then went on to describe Trump as a  low life. Former Mayor Mike Bloomberg deadpanned about the famously shy actor, according to the Daily News.  It took me years before I finally got a sentence out of Bobby. He s not a big talker. Well, Mr. De Niro isn t shy anymore. During the 2016 campaign, he said,  I d like to punch Donald Trump in the face  and called him  blatantly stupid. Earlier this year, Mr. De Niro called Trump a  flat-out blatant racist , and added,  If he was smart, he d be even more dangerous. He s dangerous as it is. He s not wrong. Trump has tried on several occasions during his usual Twitter outbursts to start a war with North Korea while throwing any attempts of diplomacy out the window. The Paris Accord? Pfft! He s consistently done away with anything that has President Barack Obama s name attached to it even if it s to the detriment of our country and/or the world. Trump s profound jealousy of his predecessor was obvious long before he started his campaign and now that he was elected by conservatives touting Pepe the Frog memes in their avatars, Trump is guided solely by his feeling of inadequacy toward Obama.Good on you, Mr. De Niro. Sometimes things just have to be said.Photo by William D. Bird/Getty Images",Fake

" Texas Governor Just Broke With Trump; This Is Unprecedented Republicans in Texas, including Gov. Greg Abbott, ripped into the new $44 billion White House disaster relief aid request as  inadequate.  It s been two months since the state was devastated by Hurricane Harvey and Donald Trump has failed on his promise to rebuild Texas. Abbott s criticism is strikingly different than the day after Trump visited Texas in the aftermath of the hurricane. His commitment was firm, strong and unequivocal,  Abbott said at the time.  That he was going to do everything he could to ensure that Texas will be restored as swiftly, as effectively as possible. But now, two months later, Republicans are calling the response  wholly inadequate,  according to the Dallas News.The White House disaster relief aid request falls well short of the demands made by officials from Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico.Greg Abbott said that the request  does not live up  to what Trump pledged in recovery aid. Abbott noted during a news conference that he s still reviewing the White House request but that it appears to be  completely inadequate.  What s more, Abbott said, it  does not live up  to what Trump has pledged in recovery aid, then he said that Washington worked faster for victims of Superstorm Sandy than for Harvey. Superstorm Sandy hit in 2012 during the Obama administration, by the way. The president has told me privately what he said publicly, and that is he wants to be the builder president. The president has said he wants this to be the best recovery from a disaster ever,  Abbott said.It s not just Abbott. Texas Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican, blasted the request as  wholly inadequate.  A chorus of Texas lawmakers slammed it as insufficient.Houston Rep. John Culberson, a Republican and appropriations committee member, ripped Trump s recovery efforts, calling the request a  complete lack of understanding of the fundamental needs of Texans  and said it is a  nightmare  for Harvey survivors.Democrats, too, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Florida Sen. Bill Nelson, are criticizing the measure as measly.If only someone has warned Abbott and his Republican colleagues to not trust Trump, then maybe they wouldn t be so shocked. Maybe we would have a different leader who has the ability to deal with critical issues. Wait, they were warned, weren t they?Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images.",Fake
" Embarrassing: NY Times Reveals Trumpâ€™s Companies Are In MASSIVE Debt A new report from the New York Times finds that Donald Trump owes twice as much debt as he reported on his public election filings.The NY Times reports: Beyond finding that companies owned by Mr. Trump had debts of at least $650 million, The Times Discovered that a substantial portion of his wealth is tied up in three passive partnerships that owe an additional $2 billion to a string of lenders, including those that hold the loan on the Avenue of the Americas building. If those loans were to go into default, Mr. trump might not be held personally liable, but the value of his investments would sink. The NY Times points out that Trump probably didn t lie about the amount of debt he has in his public filings, it s just a matter of the forms that were filled out not being designed for a person who has as complex financial holdings as Trump does.What s really interesting about the report, is that it also shows Trump s one of the very few criticisms of Hillary Clinton shared by some on the left (which he stole from progressives anyway) is now rendered completely invalid for him to make, due to it being completely hypocritical.The NY Times reports: An office building on Avenue of the Americas in Manhattan, of which Mr. Trump is part owner, carries a $950 million loan. Among the lenders: the Bank of China, one of the largest banks in a country that Mr. Trump has railed against as an economic foe of the United States, and Goldman Sachs, a financial institution he has said controls Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, after it paid her $675,000 in speaking fees. Trump has positioned himself as a strong businessman throughout his presidential campaign. However, he has come under fire from Democrats as report after report comes out showing that he is actually a huge failure in the world of business. Most notably from Elizabeth Warren who has said that  Donald Trump is a loser. Count all his failed businesses. See how he kept his father s empire afloat by cheating people with scams like Trump University and by using strategic corporate bankruptcy (excuse me, bankruptcies) to skip out on debt. The report is damning and should give Democrats a few more talking points that show just how dangerous a Trump presidency would be for the United States.Featured image from Spencer Platt/Getty Images",Fake
" WATCH: The View HAMMERS Fox News For Ignoring Trumpâ€™s Russia Scandal As Donald Trump continues to take criticism from the press over his scandalous ties to Russia, the ladies of The View noticed that one network is deafeningly silent.Ever since FBI Director James Comey confirmed that Trump is being investigated for colluding with Russia during the 2016 campaign, the scandal has only widened as House Intelligence Chairman Rep. Devin Nunes demonstrated that he s more interested in derailing the investigation than he is in pursuing it.Nunes has canceled hearings that would have shined more light on Trump s scandal and he also went to the White House to personally inform Trump about the committee s investigation, which is highly unethical and proves that Republicans are incapable of running this investigation.Indeed, Nunes own ties to Russia and Putin have been recently revealed. As it turns out, Nunes owns part of a winery that is connected to a Russian investor who is close to Putin. Furthermore, Nunes served on Trump s transition team. So it s clear that Nunes has a lot to lose if he allows the investigation to move forward.But even though the evidence against Trump is piling up and Republicans have been caught engaging in an attempted cover-up, Fox News is not screaming about it nearly as much as they were screaming about Benghazi.The hosts of View tackled Fox, Trump, and Nunes during their show on Tuesday. And it wasn t pretty either as even the most conservative hosts on the program agreed that something smells awfully fishy.First, Whoopi Goldberg slammed Trump for calling his Russia scandal a  hoax. If it is a hoax, don t you want them to investigate and clear your name, my friend?  she quipped.Joy Behar pointed out that Trump is a  serial liar  so he has zero credibility on this issue. First of all, we know he s a committed serial liar, so when he says it s a hoax, he means it s not a hoax,  she said.Sunny Hostin, who is an attorney, chimed in by attacking Nunes for sneaking off to the White House to inform Trump on what his committee is doing and noted that Nunes could also be in trouble because he may have been caught on a wiretap talking to Russian officials since he was making calls as part of Trump s transition team. Indeed, Nunes  connections to Russia and Putin combined with his unwillingness to run a fair and unbiased investigation should force him to recuse himself and step down from the House Intelligence Committee.Then Whoopi Goldberg and Jedediah Bila teamed up to hammer Fox News. Why isn t Fox screaming about this?  Goldberg asked.  They screamed about Benghazi. She s right. Fox News constantly talked about Benghazi as if it was the scandal to beat all scandals. In the end, it was only a Republican witch hunt against Hillary Clinton and no wrongdoing was found.But Donald Trump has serious connections to Russia and Vladimir Putin and it has been proven that Russia interfered in the 2016 Election on Trump s behalf, especially after Trump asked them to continue hacking our institutions. Several of Trump s aides and closest advisers have been revealed as having significant ties to Putin, including Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort, and Carter Page. Even Trump s son-in-law took a meeting with a Russian banker who has close ties to Putin.If you have a brain right now and you re a functioning person, the word  Russia  has come up way too many times with this administration,  Bila pointed out before referencing Putin.  That name is showing up too much for me to be comfortable right now. Here s the video via YouTube:It s time for Congress to let an independent commission take over the investigation from the House Intelligence Committee. Nunes has zero credibility and he has proven that he s nothing but a Trump stooge. A special prosecutor should also be appointed tot eh investigation. Donald Trump s Russia scandal has raged on for months and it s only getting bigger and bigger despite how much Republicans have been dragging their feet. If Hillary Clinton were in the White House right now, Republicans would have triggered investigation after investigation over the tiniest hints of a scandal. But Donald Trump is embroiled in a real scandal that threatens to topple our country to Putin s advantage and Republicans are reluctant to do anything about it because it threatens their power. Not only should Trump be investigated, Republicans in Congress should be investigated for being complicit.Featured image via screenshot",Fake
" BREAKING: House Dems Have HAD IT With Trump And Are Fighting Back With Protests And Lawsuits (DETAILS) House Democrats have had it with Donald Trump s unlawful Muslim ban and are planning to fight back against the bigoted executive order. To make their point loud and clear, they are planning to fight not just through legislation but are also staging a protest in front of the Supreme Court.According to a press release obtained by Addicting Info, Democrats are condemning Trump s Muslim ban as a betrayal of  everything the Statue of Liberty and our nation stand for  and insist that the order  is not only unconstitutional but immoral.  They have vowed to continue pressing for answers and are demanding  that the federal court injunction issued last night be honored. Proving just how important our efforts to resist as citizens really are, the statement said that lawmakers were  moved and inspired by the scenes of Americans, including Members of our Caucus, rallying to airports across the nation to demand justice for the men, women and children detained and/or deported under the President s order.  As a result, on Monday night at 6 p.m. Democratic House and Senate members  will gather for a press event in front of the steps of the Supreme Court to demand the President withdraw his disreputable executive order. We are witnessing an historic injustice unfold, and we must keep the pressure on,  said the release.In addition,  Immigration Subcommittee Ranking Member Zoe Lofgren and others will introduce legislation to rescind the Muslim ban  this week. Dems intend to continue reviewing the president s actions to determine if there are any other legal actions that can be taken to fight the bigoted ban.A high-level source tells Addicting Info that House Dems are engaging outside counsel to file an amicus brief against Trump s illegal Muslim Ban. We are also exploring all legal options, including an Amicus Brief in support of the ACLU,  the statement read. As Members of Congress, we take a solemn oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. Democrats intend to honor that oath by fighting the unconstitutional injustice of the President s Muslim ban. Donald Trump passed his bigoted and unconstitutional Muslim Ban on Friday. Over the weekend, people from the seven forbidden countries were detained and deported when they landed at U.S. airports. Widespread protests broke out and attorneys with the American Civil Liberties Union filed suit. A temporary stay was granted by a federal judge but it does not seem that it is being followed as intended.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",Fake
" MAJOR Scientific Magazineâ€™s Editorial Board Just BLASTED Trumpâ€™s â€˜Lack Of Respect For Scienceâ€™ In July, a Washington Post editorial called Donald Trump  a unique threat to democracy.  This is entirely true. Trump has suggested building a wall to protect from  rapists  and  murderers  Mexico is  sending  to America. He has suggested rounding up members of a religious group, forcing them to be entered into a national database and wear a special little badge, and then be thrown into concentration camps.Trump has ordered his supporters to beat African-American protesters at his hate rallies, even suggesting that he will pay their legal fees if they are arrested while acting as his attack dogs. Hell,he even kicks his own supporters out of his events if he thinks they might be a little too dark for the room. But award-winning monthly science magazine, Scientific American, wants to remind you that he has about as much respect for science as he does a well-educated, black, gay journalist who recently converted to Islam.Four years ago, the magazine s Shawn Otto warned that  the new science denialism is creating an existential crisis like few the country has faced before. Otto wrote those words in the heat of a presidential election race that now seems quaint by comparison to the one the nation now finds itself in,  the magazine s editorial board wrote in a piece that will appear in September s print edition:Scientific American is not in the business of endorsing political candidates. But we do take a stand for science the most reliable path to objective knowledge the world has seen and the Enlightenment values that gave rise to it. For more than 170 years we have documented, for better and for worse, the rise of science and technology and their impact on the nation and the world. We have strived to assert in our reporting, writing and editing the principle that decision making in the sphere of public policy should accept the conclusions that evidence, gathered in the spirit and with the methods of science, tells us to be true.It won t come as a surprise to anyone who pays even superficial attention to politics that over the past few decades facts have become an undervalued commodity. Many politicians are hostile to science, on both sides of the political aisle. The House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology has a routine practice of meddling in petty science-funding matters to score political points. Science has not played nearly as prominent a role as it should in informing debates over the labeling of genetically modified foods, end of life care and energy policy, among many issues.The current presidential race, however, is something special. It takes antiscience to previously unexplored terrain. When the major Republican candidate for president has tweeted that global warming is a Chinese plot, threatens to dismantle a climate agreement 20 years in the making and to eliminate an agency that enforces clean air and water regulations, and speaks passionately about a link between vaccines and autism that was utterly discredited years ago, we can only hope that there is nowhere to go but up.In October, as we did four years previously, we will assemble answers from the campaigns of the Democratic and Republican nominees on the public policy questions that touch on science, technology and public health and then publish them online. We will support ScienceDebate.org s efforts to persuade moderators to ask important science-related questions during the presidential debates. We encourage the nation s political leaders to demonstrate a respect for scientific truths in word and deed. And we urge the people who vote to hold them to that standard.If Donald Trump is elected President, it will be a precarious position for scientific research in general, and this is something that is important to remember.When you are speaking out against Donald Trump, remember to mention that he doesn t care about scientific progress.Featured image via Getty Images/Jeff Swanson",Fake
" This â€˜Daily Showâ€™ Reunion Is Exactly What America Needs Right Now For many people, Jon Stewart s  The Daily Show  was a welcome antidote to anything that happened during each day of the George W. Bush presidency. Now that we are 114 days into the era of President Donald Trump, it is needed more than ever. Luckily, Jon Stewart, Samantha Bee, Ed Helms and Rob Corddry were brought together by Stephen Colbert to give the country the next best thing; a  Daily Show  reunion.The group of funny people chatted about their experiences on the show, clips were played and they did one sketch. Watching the group talking about the sketches they had done and then looking at the sketches themselves was a good way to remember why we loved that show just so much.It is sometimes hard to imagine how the events that are currently happening in Washington, DC could possibly be satirized but it would be great to watch these talented people give it a try.Part one:Part two:Stephen Colbert s last day at  the Daily Show.

"For Trump, the honeymoon with Putin may be finally over WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin tossed President-elect Donald Trump a bouquet in December when he chose not to retaliate for the U.S. expulsion of Russian diplomats and seizure of Russian diplomatic compounds. The honeymoon is over. Russiaâ€™s tit-for-tat decision to expel hundreds of U.S. diplomats and seize two U.S. compounds may be an acknowledgment in Moscow that Trumpâ€™s ability to bring better ties is limited, at best, and the start of a new downward spiral in relations. Russia took the step after the U.S. Senate on Thursday sent a breath-taking signal that it does not trust Trump on Russia by passing a bill that imposes new sanctions on Moscow and ties the presidentâ€™s hands if he seeks to ease them. The White House issued a statement on Friday night saying Trump had negotiated changes to the legislation and now intends to sign it. â€œ(The Russians) have taken Trumpâ€™s measure and while they are willing to exploit his goofy fixation on Putin and naive sense you can do deals with someone like Putin ... they realize his clownish performance as president makes it really hard for him to deliver on any of the big things that Russia wants,â€ said Andrew Weiss, a former national security council Russia expert. At the top of Russiaâ€™s wish list is an easing of U.S. sanctions imposed for its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and its destabilization of eastern Ukraine, something the Senate action would all but rule out. Another, all but inconceivable,  item would be formal U.S. recognition Russiaâ€™s claim to Crimea. â€œTrumpâ€™s performance surely has left nobody in Moscow with the impression he is a guy who can deliver,â€ said Weiss, now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank. Trumpâ€™s desire, often expressed during the 2016 presidential campaign, to improve relations has been hamstrung by findings from U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered to help the Republican against Democrat Hillary Clinton. A federal law enforcement investigation and multiple U.S. congressional probes looking into the possibility that Trumpâ€™s campaign colluded with Russia, have made it harder for Trump to open a new chapter with Putin. Russia denies it interfered in the election and Trump has said there was no collusion. The Senateâ€™s 98-2 passage of the sanctions bill, which followed a 419-3 vote in the House of Representatives, forces Trump to take a hard line on Moscow or veto the legislation and infuriate his fellow Republicans. The huge margins mean Congress could easily override a veto. Weiss suggested that Trumpâ€™s low approval ratings at home, his tendency to alienate NATO allies such as Germany and his inability to pass domestic legislation all contribute to a Russian perception that he is weakening the United States. â€œ(That) is going to pay dividends for Moscow, so there is no need to turn him away from the course he is already on which is self-destructive and bad for Americaâ€™s standing internationally. All of that is a huge win for the Kremlin,â€ Weiss said. Russia gave the United States until Sept. 1 to cut its diplomatic staff in Russia to 455 people, the number of Russian diplomats left in the United States after Washington expelled 35 Russians in December because of the alleged election hacking. It also said it would seize a Moscow compound used by U.S. diplomats as well as a U.S. diplomatic warehouse. Some former officials said Russia could take other steps, such as seeking to help Russian-backed forces seize more ground in eastern Ukraine or to try to limit U.S. air operations in Syria, while others said any reaction might be more muted. Russia could look at imposing economic counter-sanctions against the United States, the former official said, saying he thought that retaliation in Ukraine or Syria was less likely because it was more likely to lead to a U.S. counter response. Michael McFaul, the U.S. ambassador to Russia from 2012-2014, said he does not think that Russia will escalate tensions with the United States just yet because Trumpâ€™s assertions that he wants better relations with Moscow are encouraging Putin to continue seeking some kind of accommodation with the U.S. president. â€œI donâ€™t think they are going to walk away from that just yet,â€ said McFaul. â€œI believe that Putin still believes there might be something he can do with Trump.â€ ",Real

" WATCH: Jimmy Fallon Takes HILARIOUS Dig At Trump During Opening Speech At Golden Globes Tonight s the night of the Golden Globe Awards, and comedian Jimmy Fallon was tapped to emcee the event. Before he even started his opening monologue, his teleprompter failed, so he ad libbed the whole thing. And he used the opportunity to take an awesome dig at Donald Trump for it.We all know by now that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by more than 3 million, but Trump still won thanks to the way the Electoral College works. Fallon touched on that when he said: This is the Golden Globes, one of the few places left where America still honors the popular vote. Our manchild of a  leader  doesn t like things like this very much. Trump has been railing off and on about the popular vote controversy, despite the fact that his electoral votes secured his win, despite the fact that the electors still voted for him on Dec. 19, and despite the fact that Congress just certified that vote over the protests of several House Democrats and many Americans. He has been quiet of late about it, but he still seems to be smarting over his popular vote loss.Fallon didn t stop there, though. He also compared Trump to  Game of Thrones  King Joffrey, saying: [Game of Thrones] has so many plot twists and shocking moments, a lot of people are wondering what it would be like if King Joffery had lived. Well, in 12 days we re gonna find out,were carefully tabulated by the accounting firm Ernst and Young and Putin.

" Cowardly GOP Rep. Files Police Complaint Against SENIORS Because Heâ€™s TERRIFIED Of Dissent Republican members of Congress, who love claiming that they re the only party that stands for real Americans, are now terrified of their own constituents. This is happening for one simple reason   they never expected their own constituents to be angry with what they re doing on Capitol Hill. So instead of facing the music and admitting that the entire GOP platform is something Americans don t want, they re running scared.Such is the case with Idaho representative Raul Labrador. His office had the audacity to file a complaint against a group of people made up primarily of senior citizens because they were showing up at his office in Lewiston on a weekly basis to voice their displeasure with him and the GOP. Labrador obviously considers this a threat, and perhaps, if they d threatened violence it would be.But that s not what s happening. Chris Ankeny, the chief of police in Lewiston, the Idaho town where this is taking place, says these people were protesting in front of Labrador s offices and that no crimes had been committed. Employees are uncomfortable with them because of the national attention this group had garnered, not because of credible (or even in-credible) threats.Labrador s office contacted the D.C. Capitol Police over this because that force has jurisdiction over U.S. Congresspeople s offices in addition to Capitol Hill. They did so because they felt the Lewiston department wasn t doing anything. The thing is, a good police department won t do anything when they confirm that there s no crime happening (including threats). So what this is is an office full of people who can t handle dissent.The worst part is that this group has so many seniors, and Labrador won t hear them. These are people who may be worried about cuts to programs they depend on, including Medicare and Meals on Wheels. Others living in and around Lewiston are worried about climate change and clean energy. They say Labrador s absence from his offices is a sign of cowardice, and they re not wrong. He is a coward.Many Republicans have run away and hidden from their constituents lately because they can t tolerate the fact that their constituents  concerns run counter to the GOP s platform. They re too used to putting party above country. Maybe this is uncharted territory for them, but shouldn t these guys, who work for the very people they re pissing off, actually stop to listen?Or are they not what they ve been trying to sell to us?It s really disgusting that Labrador s office feels so threatened by non-violent, non-threatening protests from senior citizens that they ve had to file a complaint.Featured image by Gage Skidmore.

" President Obama Warns Putin: Donâ€™t Hack Our Elections Recently, intelligence agencies, including the FBI, have found evidence linking Russian state-sponsored hackers as the culprits in multiple breaches of Democratic institutions and state election systems. In what is being seen as tilt-the-election in favor of Republican nominee Donald Trump (due to Democrats being the victim in all the cyber-intrusions), President Obama issued a strong warning to Russian president Vladimir Putin: don t mess with our elections.Although not mentioning the election specifically (as far as we know), President Obama warned Putin that should he start a cyber war with the United States, we would have the upper hand: I will tell you we ve had problems with cyber intrusions from Russia in the past and from other countries in the past. We re moving into a new era here and frankly, we ve got more capacity than anybody both offensively and defensively  What we cannot do is have a situation where this becomes the wild, wild West, where countries that have significant cyber capacity start engaging in unhealthy competition or conflict through these means. President Obama also urged Putin not to duplicate or continue the  cycle of escalation  when it comes to nation s hacking others for personal, political or economic gain.And that s how it s done. Trump, take note.It was reported in the Washington Post on Sunday that American intelligence officials are formally launching an investigation to find out if Russian state-sponsored hackers are planning on a disruption in November s general election:The aim is to understand the scope and intent of the Russian campaign, which incorporates  cyber-tools to hack systems used in the political process, enhancing Russia s ability to spread disinformation  A Russian influence operation in the United States  is something we re looking very closely at,  said one senior intelligence official who, like others interviewed, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter. Officials also are examining potential disruptions to the election process, and the FBI has alerted state and local officials to potential cyberthreats.It s no secret the Russians are pro-Trump, who they see as the perfect puppet for their thugs at the Kremlin. Not only do they see Trump as the way to continue their illegal, coercive and consequential actions, they have actively purchased his campaign with Paul Manafort (before he was forced to resign after it was discovered).Luckily, President Obama has the guts to stand up to Russia and their Gestapo tactics. While Trump folds like an accordion in Mexico, President Obama flexes his muscles.Don t mess with the United States  elections.Featured image via Lintao Zhang/Getty Images",Fake

"U.S. House passes bill to fund government through September WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday passed a $1.2 trillion spending bill to fund the government through September and avoid federal agency shutdowns on Saturday when existing money is depleted. With the 309-118 vote in the Republican-controlled chamber, the legislation now goes to the Senate, which is expected to pass it before a midnight Friday deadline. The Pentagon is a big winner in the legislation, with defense spending rising significantly. While the bill cleared the House easily, dozens more Democrats voted for it than Republicans, many of whom oppose most spending measures. This was the first major legislation to pass the House this year with bipartisan support and marks Republican President Donald Trumpâ€™s first legislative victory, even though he railed against some of its provisions. The legislation bulks up federal funding for border security but does not pay for starting construction on a U.S.-Mexico border wall that Trump promised to keep out illegal immigrants and drugs. Trump had said he would make Mexico pay for the wall, but the Mexican government refused, making it necessary for the new administration to ask Congress for the money. Democrats and many Republicans have argued that a wall is an ineffective and wasteful way of securing the southern border. Another battle over the barrier is expected when Congress tries to pass a spending bill for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1. Trump already has begun focusing on that upcoming fight. In a tweet on Tuesday, he taunted lawmakers, saying, â€œOur country needs a good â€˜shutdownâ€™ in September to fix mess!â€ The legislation would add $12.5 billion this fiscal year for the Pentagon, with another $2.5 billion available after Trump gives details on his plans for defeating the Islamic State militant group. It ignores many of the spending cuts on domestic programs the White House had sought and adds $2 billion for the National Institutes of Health, $295 million for Puerto Ricoâ€™s underfunded Medicaid healthcare for the poor and $407 million to fight fires in Western states. But the legislation is late in coming. The fiscal year began last Oct. 1 and for the last seven months federal agencies have been operating mainly on simple extensions of the previous yearâ€™s funding and the priorities that came with that.

" Trump Willing To Discuss Solar Powered Border Wall If Everyone Agrees It Was His Idea Trump took some time today during a White House meeting with Republican congressional leaders to brag about his new ideas for the border wall.

He bragged that they would be  beautiful structures,  because most walls are only 14 or 15 feet high, and these ones would be taller and better.Trump did have one caveat going forward with solar panel border wall discussion   he insisted that lawmakers could talk about it as long as they told everyone it was his idea!

" BREAKING: Benghazi-Obsessed GOP Congressman Jason Chaffetz Too Scared To Run For Re-election (DETAILS) Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) has been a thorn in the side of Democrats ever since Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State. He blamed her for many things that clearly were beyond her control, most notably the attacks on the compound in Benghazi, Libya, that wound up taking the lives of multiple America diplomats. After that attack, Chaffetz, who chairs the House Oversight Committee, spent more than two years and millions in taxpayer money to keep investigating Hillary   each time coming up empty because she did nothing wrong. He even said he had investigations lined up in the event that Hillary took the White House. Well, now that Trump is president and there are no more Clinton investigations to keep his base salivating, Chaffetz has announced that there will be no 2018 Congressional race for him.Chaffetz took to Facebook Wednesday morning to announce his decision, and, of course, he insists that it was not a politically motivated move: After long consultation with my family and prayerful consideration, I have decided I will not be a candidate for any office in 2018. For those that would speculate otherwise, let me be clear that I have no ulterior motives. I am healthy. I am confident I would continue to be re-elected by large margins. I have the full support of Speaker Ryan to continue as Chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. That said, I have made a personal decision to return to the private sector. Here is the embed of the full Facebook post:Despite what Chaffetz is saying regarding his reasons for not running again, it s likely a pack of lies. After all, he made it his mission to destroy Hillary Clinton, and made it clear that he would continue to try and get her on something, anything were she to be elected president. However, now that we have Trump as president instead of Hillary, Chaffetz is choosing to turn a blind eye to all of Trump s scandals. He refuses to look into Trump s conflicts of interest, is mum on the Russia investigation for the most part, and has nothing to say on Trump s lies and obvious character flaws and deficiencies. In short   as long as the president is a Republican, he can trample the law into pieces all he wants.This stance would have likely been problematic for Chaffetz in the 2018 Congressional race, to say the least. His state largely loathed Trump, and the alternative conservative candidate and #NeverTrump media star Evan McMullin got a good chunk of the vote. In short   Chaffetz would have been primaried, and would have likely suffered a crushing defeat there. Instead of risking that, he is choosing to bow out early, and use lame excuses to do so.All I can say is good riddance, you nasty little tool. We won t be missing you.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",Fake

"Minnesota Senate may halt operations on Dec. 1 due to funding dispute (Reuters) - The Minnesota Senate will furlough its workers and suspend operations as soon as Dec. 1 due to an ongoing funding dispute with Governor Mark Dayton, the chamberâ€™s Republican leader announced on Wednesday.   Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka said his chamber will run out of money by next month unless the state courts restore funding for the legislature that was vetoed by Dayton. He added that the Senate plans to seek certain funds from the Legislative Coordinating Committee which would keep the chamber operating through Jan. 12. â€œWe donâ€™t take the suspension of operations of the Minnesota Senate lightly â€“ this is not a game â€“ but we really have no other choice today,â€ Gazelka said in a statement. The chamberâ€™s workforce includes dozens of lawyers, analysts, researchers and assistants who work with committees and on legislation. The Democratic governorâ€™s office blamed Gazelka for the impending shutdown. â€œDespite sitting on nearly $45 million in available state funding for his operations, he and other legislative leaders are choosing to lay off their own employees, rather than admit that they have misled the courts, the press, and the public about their true financial situation,â€ said Matt Swenson, the governorâ€™s assistant chief of staff.   Dayton in May vetoed funding for the Republican-controlled legislature from the stateâ€™s new two-year budget in an effort to pressure lawmakers to revise tax measures that he said will harm the stateâ€™s financial stability. The move touched off a legal battle with lawmakers, who claimed the elimination of nearly $130 million in funding was unconstitutional. While a Ramsey County District Court judge sided with the legislature in July, the state Supreme Court on Sept. 8 determined that the governorâ€™s action was constitutional. However, the high court raised concerns over the ability of the legislature to survive without funding and ordered the two sides into mediation, which ended in an impasse. Gazelka said it was imperative for the court to step in again.  â€œThe people of Minnesota will no longer have a voice in the legislative branch after the first of the year, not to mention the pain inflicted on our employees,â€ he said. In a September court filing, the House of Representatives said it anticipated running out of money on Feb. 1. ",Real

" Chuck Schumer Just NUKED Trump For Blaming Him For Terrorist Attack Donald Trump just got owned.On Tuesday, New York City was attacked by a terrorist who killed eight people with a truck.Police immediately responded and apprehended the driver after shooting him in the abdomen.Of course, Trump rushed to politicize the attack, and continued doing so on Wednesday morning by blaming Senator Chuck Schumer for the act of terror.And, yes, Trump was watching Fox & Friends while tweeting.The terrorist came into our country through what is called the ""Diversity Visa Lottery Program,"" a Chuck Schumer beauty. I want merit based.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2017We are fighting hard for Merit Based immigration, no more Democrat Lottery Systems. We must get MUCH tougher (and smarter). @foxandfriends  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2017""Senator Chuck Schumer helping to import Europes problems"" said Col.Tony Shaffer. We will stop this craziness! @foxandfriends  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2017Let s keep in mind that this attack happened on Trump s watch. Prior to yesterday s attack, no terrorist had used a vehicle to murder American citizens. Trump promised to keep Americans safe and he promised to wipe out ISIS. He failed.And instead of taking responsibility, Trump decided to blame the top Democrat in the Senate.But Schumer was quick to respond, and he hammered Trump with his own budget, which Republicans are poised to pass.As it turns out, Trump eliminated anti-terrorism funding in his budget and refused to put it back even after the NYPD announced that their anti-terror program would be wiped out by the cut.Schumer wasted no time pointing out Trump s hypocrisy. I have always believed and continue to believe that immigration is good for America. President Trump, instead of politicizing and dividing America, which he always seems to do at times of national tragedy, should be focusing on the real solution   anti-terrorism funding   which he proposed cutting in his most recent budget. I m calling on the President to immediately rescind his proposed cuts to this vital anti-terrorism funding. Basically, Trump would be inviting terrorists to attack the United States by cutting anti-terrorism funding. So instead of worrying about our immigration policies, Americans should be angry about Trump s irresponsible decision to cut funding that helps law enforcement keep us safe.Featured Image: Spencer Platt/Getty Images",Fake
" WATCH: Van Jones EVISCERATES Supporter Who Thinks Trumpâ€™s Tax Evasion Is â€˜Geniusâ€™ Donald Trump has been positioning himself as an outsider who is going to clean up the corruption that is rampant in the United States government. That is, of course, absolute hogwash. It is the billionaire class that has ushered in our current era of oligarchical rule. On Sunday, CNN political analyst Van Jones informed one of Trump s surrogates that he is a billionaire who manipulates the tax code for his benefit and thus is the corruption he claims to be fighting.During Sunday s broadcast of CNN s State of the Union, the show s host Jake Tapper questioned Trump super fan Rachel Campos-Duffy on the New York Times  revelation that Trump may have used the tax code in a way to get out of paying income taxes for two decades. She dodged his question and said that President Obama is  the epitome of cronyism. Jones then called out Campos-Duffy for evading the question, saying  That s a good pivot.  That s when Jones let Campos-Duffy have it. He lambasted her and Trump for championing his tax manipulation.  It is, in fact, true if Donald Trump lost a billion dollars, think about this, lost a billion dollars, he could wind up as a winner legally in his taxes for a generation. Is that because he s a genius?  Jones asked incredulously.  It s because billionaires have armies of lobbyists to write the rules. Here s the deal: If you re obeying horrible rules that you helped to write, that doesn t make you a genius. It makes you a part of the corruption. That s exactly what every Trump supporter needs to understand. Trump is not the answer to the problems that are facing the nation. By electing Trump as president, all they are doing is taking the middle man out of the corrupt political process. Instead of electing officials who take orders from the wealthy, they would just be electing the wealthy to the office directly. The segment is one of the best that has come out of a political talk show this election season. Van Jones masterfully expresses what so many who have been fighting against Trump since he was crowned with Republican presidential nomination. What s more, Center for American Progress  CEO Neera Tanden explains exactly why it is so important for Trump to release his tax returns. If he did so, he could prove that he is as honest as he says he is. However, he won t.  He has broken from decades of tradition and only offers pathetic excuses as to why he won t release his returns. It does not appear that he will do so even now. That s because he has something to hide. The moment he does his campaign will be effectively over. If one snippet of info from his 1995 returns can be as damaging as they have so far been, one can only imagine the skeletons he is hiding.You can watch the segment below in full.Featured image from video screenshot",Fake
"Failed vote to oust president shakes up Peru's politics LIMA (Reuters) - Peruâ€™s President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski could end up the surprise winner of an attempt to oust him from power this week, after some opposition lawmakers broke ranks with party leaders to support him, opening a divide that might strengthen his hand. Despite having a Congressional majority, the rightwing opposition party Popular Force was unable to push through a motion to remove Kuczynski from office on Thursday, after 10 of its own lawmakers broke ranks to save the president. The vote cemented a growing divide in the opposition and looked to threaten its control over Congress, potentially aiding Kuczynski as he tries to restore political stability and revive investments in one of Latin Americaâ€™s most robust economies. The surprise defection was the result of a deal struck between Kuczynski and Popular Force rebel lawmaker Kenji Fujimori to get his father and ex-president Alberto Fujimori out of prison, alleged Popular Force secretary general, Jose Chlimper. Over the past year, Kenji has courted Kuczynskiâ€™s center-right government while challenging his sister Keikoâ€™s leadership of the rightwing populist movement that their father formed in the 1990s. In defiance of his sister, Kenji threw his support behind Kuczynski ahead of the vote on whether to remove him from office over unproven graft allegations. Nine other Popular Force lawmakers followed his lead. â€œThis is the birth of a serious and formal split (in the Fujimori movement),â€ said Guillermo Loli, the head of political research for pollster Ipsos Peru. â€œEverything points to a pardon,â€ he added.     Kuczynskiâ€™s government denied that a pardon for Fujimori was part of its political negotiations. In an address to the nation late on Friday, Kuczynski said he would spend the coming days reflecting on his year and a half in office. â€œIâ€™ll be announcing to you changes to make sure 2018 is not just a year of greater growth, but politically different,â€ Kuczynski said. Efforts to reach the Popular Force lawmakers who defected were not successful. One, Clayton Galvan, said on local TV channel Canal N that Alberto Fujimori called them from prison to ask them to help Kuczynski stay in power.     Alberto Fujimori, who is serving a 25-year sentence for graft and human rights crimes, is a deeply divisive figure in Peru. While many consider him a corrupt dictator, others credit him with ending an economic crisis and bloody leftist insurgency during his 1990-2000 term. Freeing him would likely anger the well-organized foes of the Fujimori clan - a mix of technocrats, leftists, human rights activists and academics. â€œThe day (Kuczynski) signs a pardon, he loses all of those guys. Permanently,â€ said Harvard University political scientist Steve Levitsky. Support from the anti-Fujimori crowd was key to Kuczynskiâ€™s razor-thin victory over Keiko in last yearâ€™s presidential election, and to keeping the motion to oust him from succeeding. â€œKuczynski was saved by two diametrically opposed political groups: Kenjiâ€™s group and the left, which opposes a pardon. He canâ€™t please both of them,â€ said Levitsky. Kuczynski, a 79-year-old former investment banker, took office amid hopes he would usher in cleaner government and faster economic growth. Instead, a graft scandal roiling Latin America has stalled investments and ensnared him in allegations of wrongdoing. Before the vote on Thursday, Kuczynski fanned fears of a return to Peruâ€™s authoritarian past and described the motion as part of a legislative â€œcoupâ€ attempt by Keikoâ€™s supporters. Popular Force denies the charge and says the bid to remove him was part of its fight against corruption and within the bounds of the constitution. A hardline Popular Force lawmaker loyal to Keiko, Hector Becerril, said the Kenji faction represented â€œtraitors.â€  â€œIf they have any sense of decency after this vote, the least they could do is present their resignations,â€ Becerril told journalists on Friday. â€œHopefully today.â€ With 10 votes fewer, Popular Force would command 61 seats in the 130-member, single-chamber Congress, less than an absolute majority, though it would still be the biggest voting bloc. The political crisis has cost Kuczynski his interior minister, Carlos Basombrio, who announced his resignation on Friday. Kuczynski could make a decision about other Cabinet changes in coming days, his government said.             ",Real
"U.S. officials discussing withholding some aid to Egypt over NGO law WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. officials are discussing whether to withhold a portion of U.S. assistance to Egypt to protest Egyptian passage of a law that imposes restrictions on non-governmental organizations, a senior administration official said on Wednesday. Officials have not reached an agreement on whether to proceed with a recommendation to President Donald Trump and his senior leadership, but there is a feeling that some action is necessary in reaction to the move by Egypt, the official told Reuters. U.S. aid to Egypt has long been sacrosanct. Egypt is one of Washingtonâ€™s closest allies in the Middle East, receiving $1.3 billion in U.S. military aid and about $200 million in economic assistance annually. â€œWe told them over and over again donâ€™t do this, that they are putting at risk U.S. aid, but they did it anyway,â€ the official said. â€œWeâ€™re figuring out how to respond.â€ The discussions involve cutting off a portion of American aid, not all of it, the official said. The Egyptian law restricts NGO activity to developmental and social work and introduces jail terms of up to give years for non-compliance. Egyptian lawmakers said the law was necessary to protect national security. The government has long accused human rights groups of taking foreign funds to sow chaos and several are facing investigation over their funding. In May, when the law was issued after being ratified by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, U.S. senators criticized it. Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham called it â€œdraconian legislationâ€ and they said the U.S. Congress should in response â€œstrengthen democratic benchmarks and human rights conditions on U.S. assistance for Egypt.â€  U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, and nine other senators sent Trump a letter on June 19 urging the president to press Sisi on the issue. â€œThe U.S. Congress will take the Egyptian governmentâ€™s recent actions into consideration as we review our bilateral assistance to Egypt to ensure that the American peopleâ€™s tax dollars are used appropriately,â€ the letter said. U.S. President Barack Obama froze aid to Egypt for two years after Sisi, then a general, overthrew Islamist President Mohamed Mursi in mid-2013 after mass protests against Mursiâ€™s rule. Trump has been intent on rebooting the bilateral relationship with Sisi and building on the strong connection the two presidents established when they first met in New York last September. Trump gave Sisi firm backing and vowed to work together to fight Islamist militants when Sisi visited the White House in April. ",Real
" Lindsey Graham Calls Out His Own Party; Says Republicans Arenâ€™t Patriotic (VIDEO) S.C. Senator Lindsey Graham has been a shining beacon in the Republican Party when it comes to the Russian hacking scandal. He knows that no matter what party it benefited, it s beyond dangerous to let a foreign government, especially a foreign nuclear power, gain control over our elections.On Sunday s Meet the Press, Graham laid down a pretty brutal truth bomb for Republicans, calling them  political hacks,  and unpatriotic. Most Republicans are condemning what Russia did. And to those who are gleeful about it   you re a political hack. You re not a Republican. You re not a patriot,  Graham said during an appearance on NBC News s  Meet the Press with Chuck Todd. We should all   Republicans, Democrats   condemn Russia for what they did. To my Republican friends who are gleeful, you re making a huge mistake,  Graham said.Graham added that he hopes Trump, who signaled in his campaign that he would work for a better relationship with the Kremlin, takes advantage of the chance to  make Russia pay a price  for trying to meddle in the election.Source: The Hill17 intelligence agencies have all come to the conclusion that Russia hacked our election and loaded social media with fake news. It was clearly enough to sway the election. Donald Trump has been in a general state of denial about it. On Saturday, he tweeted,  Intelligence stated very strongly there was absolutely no evidence that hacking affected the election results. Voting machines not touched.  But even his camp is starting to come around. However, they re blaming it on the Democratic National Committee for apparently making it too easy to get hacked. Of course, the Republican National Committee was also hacked, but the Russians and WikiLeaks chose to sit on those revelations, perhaps to use them for a later date?Graham expressed confusion about Trump s relationship with Russia. I don t know what drives him on Russia, but I do know this. That if our policies don t change vis a vis Russia, the worst is yet to come. And the Congress is going to have a different view on Russia than the president-elect does,  he said.Here s the video:Featured image via Riccardo Savi via Getty Images.",Fake

After Trump retweeted the leader of Britain First, a fascist white nationalist group, Prime Minister Theresa May decided she had had enough. She publicly criticized Trump, and made it clear that she in no way approved of his identifying with Britain First. May said of Trump s tweets: The fact that we work together does not mean that we re afraid to say when we think the United States has got it wrong, and be very clear with them. And I m very clear that retweeting from Britain First was the wrong thing to do. May went on to call Britain First a  hateful organization  that has caused division in her nation.

"Trump administration sends conflicting signals on Russia sanctions WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump grudgingly accepted new congressional sanctions on Russia, the top U.S. diplomat said on Tuesday, remarks in contrast with those of Vice President Mike Pence, who said the bill showed Trump and Congress speaking â€œwith a unified voice.â€ The U.S. Congress voted last week by overwhelming margins  for sanctions to punish the Russian government over interference in the 2016 presidential election, annexation of Crimea and other perceived violations of international norms.  U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters that he and Trump did not believe the new sanctions would â€œbe helpful to our effortsâ€ on diplomacy with Russia. Trump has been clear that he wants to improve relations with Russia, a desire that has been hamstrung by findings of U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered to help the Republican against Democrat Hillary Clinton. U.S. congressional panels and a special counsel are investigating. Moscow denies any meddling and Trump denies any collusion by his campaign. Tillerson, who did business in Russia when he was chief executive of Exxon Mobil, has said repeatedly that the worldâ€™s two major nuclear powers cannot have such a bad relationship. â€œThe action by the Congress to put these sanctions in place and the way they did, neither the President nor I were very happy about that,â€ Tillerson said. â€œWe were clear that we didnâ€™t think it was going to be helpful to our efforts, but thatâ€™s the decision they made, they made it in a very overwhelming way. I think the president accepts that.â€ Tillerson stopped short of saying definitively that Trump would sign the sanctions, saying only that â€œall indications are he will sign that bill.â€ Vice President Mike Pence, at a press conference in Georgia with Prime Minister Giorgi Kvirikashvili, said unequivocally that â€œPresident Trump will sign the Russia sanctions bill soon.â€ Pence acknowledged that the administration objected to earlier versions of the sanctions bill because it did not grant enough flexibility to the administration, but said it â€œimproved significantlyâ€ in later versions. â€œAnd let me say that in signing the sanction, our President and our Congress are speaking with a unified voice,â€ Pence said. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said on Tuesday the sanctions bill was under review and would be signed. â€œThereâ€™s nothing holding him back,â€ Sanders said at a news briefing. Trump has until Aug. 9 to sign the bill, or veto it, or it will automatically become law. In retaliation for the sanctions, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Sunday that the U.S. diplomatic mission in Russia must reduce its staff by 755 people. Russia is also seizing two properties near Moscow used by American diplomats. Tillerson said Putin probably believes his response was a symmetrical action to Washington seizing two Russian properties in the United States and expelling 35 diplomats last December. â€œOf course it makes our lives more difficult,â€ he said. Tillerson said he and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov would meet in Manila on the margins of next weekendâ€™s meetings of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. ",Real
"Highlights: The Trump presidency on March 31 at 6:19 p.m. EDT (Reuters) - Highlights of the day for U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s administration on Friday: Trump backs a decision by his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, to seek immunity in congressional investigations of possible ties between his campaign and Russia, but there is no immediate sign the request will be granted.  The Trump administration slams China on a range of trade issues from its chronic industrial overcapacity to forced technology transfers and longstanding bans on U.S. beef and electronic payment services. Beijing seeks to play down tensions with the United States and put on a positive face ahead of President Xi Jinpingâ€™s first meeting with Trump next week. Senate Democrats step closer to having enough votes to block a confirmation vote on Trumpâ€™s Supreme Court nominee with three more Democratic senators coming out against Neil Gorsuch for the lifetime job as a justice. Trump seeks to push his plan for fair trade and more manufacturing jobs back to the top of his agenda by ordering a study into the causes of U.S. trade deficits and a clampdown on import duty evasion. Trump has neither a clear White House tax plan nor adequate staff yet to see through a planned tax overhaul, according to interviews with people in the administration, in Congress and among U.S. tax experts. Democrats are trying to counter Trumpâ€™s boldest move yet to defang the U.S. consumer financial watchdog, with 40 current and former lawmakers defending the agency in court. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agencyâ€™s scientific integrity watchdog is reviewing whether EPA chief Scott Pruitt violated the agencyâ€™s policies when he said in a television interview he does not believe carbon dioxide is driving global climate change, according to an email seen by Reuters. Trump will seek to rebuild the U.S. relationship with Egypt at a meeting on Monday with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi focused on security issues and military aid, a senior White House official says. Trump will host Jordanâ€™s King Abdullah at the White House next week to discuss the fight against Islamic State militants, the Syria crisis and advancing peace between Israelis and Palestinians, the White House says.

"Republican congressional candidate in Montana cited with assaulting reporter MISSOULA, Mont. (Reuters) - Montana Republican congressional candidate Greg Gianforte was cited for a misdemeanor on Wednesday after a reporter accused him of physical assault on the eve of a special election to fill the stateâ€™s lone seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. The Gallatin County sheriffâ€™s office issued the citation for misdemeanor assault hours after Ben Jacobs, a political correspondent for the U.S. edition of the Guardian newspaper, said in a Twitter post and in a television interview that Gianforte â€œbody slammedâ€ him, breaking his eyeglasses. The incident, which caps a campaign seen as a possible bellwether for next yearâ€™s mid-term congressional races, took place at an event in Bozeman, where Jacobs sought to question Gianforte about healthcare, according to an audio tape captured by Jacobs and played on cable television networks MSNBC and CNN. Fox News Channel reporter Alicia Acuna, who said she and her crew were in the room preparing to interview Gianforte, wrote that she saw Gianforte as he â€œgrabbed Jacobs by the neck with both hands and slammed him to the ground.â€ Acuna, her field producer and photographer then â€œwatched in disbelief as Gianforte began punching (Jacobs) as he moved to top of the reporter.â€ Gianforteâ€™s campaign did not deny Jacobsâ€™ allegation but countered in its own statement that Jacobs instigated an altercation by barging into the candidateâ€™s office, shoved a recording device in his face â€œand began asking badgering questions.â€ â€œAfter asking Jacobs to lower the recorder, Jacobs declined,â€ campaign spokesman Shane Scanlon wrote. â€œGreg then attempted to grab the phone that was pushed in his face. Jacobs grabbed Gregâ€™s wrist and spun away from Greg, pushing them both to the ground.â€ â€œItâ€™s unfortunate that this aggressive behavior from a liberal journalist created this scene at our campaign volunteer BBQ,â€ the statement said. Acuna disputed that Jacobs was the aggressor. â€œAt no point did any of us who witnessed this assault see Jacobs show any form of physical aggression toward Gianforte,â€ Acuna wrote in her account on the Fox News website.  Interviewed later on MSNBC, Jacobs said he retreated to a parking lot after the confrontation to call his editor and the police. He said he was speaking to MSNBC from a hospital where he was getting his elbow X-rayed. The citation was issued after authorities conducted several interviews and investigated the incident, Sheriff Brian Gootkin said in a statement.  Gianforte has until June 7 to appear in a county court. He faces a $500 fine and six months in jail if convicted, according to Gootkin.  â€œThe nature of the injuries did not meet the statutory elements of felony assault,â€ Gootkin said.   In Jacobsâ€™ audio tape of the incident, Gianforte is heard shouting: â€œIâ€™m sick and tired of you guys. The last guy who came here, you did the same thing.â€  After loud scuffling noises are heard, Gianforte repeatedly yells: â€œGet the hell out of here.â€ Jacobs is heard saying: â€œYou just body-slammed me and broke my glasses.â€  According to the tape, the confrontation began as Jacobs tried to ask Gianforte if he supported a Republican healthcare overhaul bill after the Congressional Budget Office found the measure would cost 23 million Americans their medical insurance coverage by 2026.  Another reporter, Alexis Levinson of BuzzFeed News, who was just outside the office, said on Twitter she saw Jacobsâ€™ â€œfeet fly in the air as he hit the floorâ€ amid yelling and commotion. Gianforte later huddled behind closed doors with an aide before leaving the event by car, she said. Tech executive Gianforte is running against Democrat Rob Quist, a banjo-playing political novice who hopes to pull off a surprise victory in the Republican-leaning state.  A victory for Quist could signal trouble ahead for President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans as they defend their 24-seat House majority in the 2018 mid-term elections. Quist and Gianforte are vying for the seat vacated when Trump, who carried Montana by more than 20 percentage points, named Ryan Zinke as U.S. interior secretary. Republicans have held the seat for two decades and Gianforte was still the favorite. However, both sides say the race was tightening as Quist focused on criticism of Republican efforts to repeal and replace former Democratic President Barack Obamaâ€™s signature healthcare law, the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare.

So one would think Giuliani would know better than to blatantly lie.But that s exactly what he did during a rally in Florida on Wednesday in support of serial groper Donald Trump. Don t tell me if you said that you remember September 11, 2001,  Giuliani said in reference to Hillary talking about being in the city.  I remember September 11, 2001. Yes, yes, you helped to get benefits for the people who were injured that day. But I heard her say that she was there that day. I was there that day, I don t remember seeing Hillary Clinton there. That was like when she said she had to run through gunfire. That turned out to be, what do we call it? A lie. But don t tell me that you subscribe to the notion that all of us who were there on September 11, and we re lucky to have been alive and lost so many friends.

" Trump Freaks Out, Ends Interview When Reporter Asks Him To Prove Obama Wiretap Accusation (VIDEO) In an unreal feat, Trump managed to have two humiliating interviews come out on the same day. While much of the country (and indeed, the world) was laughing at Trump for his insane screed about the Civil War, CBS News released their own interview with Trump which showed the president descending into sheer madness when pressed to support his (false) claim that President Obama wiretapped him. For those worried about the mental stability of the person currently within arm s reach of America s nuclear arsenal, it was perhaps the more disturbing of the two interviews.You can almost hear Trump s staffers groan when he, out of nowhere, brings up the wiretap claims. Sensing a moment to finally press Trump on these unsubstantiated smears of his predecessor, CBS s John Dickerson asks Trump pointblank whether he still stands by the accusations that Obama is a  bad and sick  guy who had committed felonies on par with Nixon s Watergate scandal. Since making the claims, Trump s arguments have been repeatedly debunked and zero evidence to support him has emerged. Has he changed his mind?Just the opposite. He appears to have become even more delusional: I think our side s been proven very strongly and everybody s talking about it and frankly, it should be discussed. Trump added,  We should find out what the hell is going on. Dickerson:  I m asking you because you don t want it to be fake news. I want to hear it from President Trump. Trump:  You don t have to ask me. You don t have to ask me. Dickerson:  Why not? Trump:  Because I have my own opinions, you can have your own opinions. Dickerson points out that Trump s  own opinions  are kind of important because he s the president of the United States. At this point, Trump shuts down completely, ending the interview and running to his desk. The last shot the camera captures is Trump visibly fuming.

" WATCH: Jake Tapper Mocks Republicans HARD On CNN For Humiliating Failure To Pass Trumpcare House Republicans had seven years to come up with a plan superior to the Affordable Care Act and their plan is so bad that not even the GOP majority could pass it.After uselessly voting to repeal the Affordable Care Act over sixty times during those years in order to please their conservative base, Republicans appear to be chickening out from actually doing it.Because once the dubiously named American Healthcare Act passes, it would strip health care from over 20 million Americans, many of whom are Republican voters for some reason.The bill would also cause the price of healthcare to skyrocket, especially for senior citizens who would have to pay ten times as much as they do right now under the Affordable Care Act.Anyway, the vote on the Republican bill was scheduled for Thursday, but once Republican leadership realized that they could muster enough members of their own party to get the necessary number of votes, they canceled the vote.Seriously. Republicans control the House and they couldn t even bring up their own bill for an up or down vote. Simply put, it was a humiliating failure of epic proportions.Once Donald Trump found the egg on his face, he immediately demanded that House Republicans vote on Friday. And so we now wait for the moment when Trump suffers a major policy defeat because Republicans discovered that repealing the Affordable Care Act isn t such a great idea after all.Adding to the humiliation on Thursday was CNN anchor Jake Tapper, who pointed out how long Republicans have been having their collective wet-dream about repealing the signature achievement of America s first black president, and then mocked them for failing to do so. It turns out it s a lot easier for Republican leaders to say  repeal and replace  than to do it,  Tapper said. Seven years ago today, the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare was signed into law by President Obama and since that time Republicans have been planning, hoping, dreaming for this day, the moment where they could finally repeal Obamacare and replace it with their own solution to the nation s health care mess. They have had seven years to prepare for this day.Now weeks after optimistic talk from House leaders, declarations from White House secretary Sean Spicer that  the bill will pass the House tonight and there is no Plan B,  well, the bill was in such peril Republican leaders pulled it and postponed the vote. And what critics are calling an  embarrassing and ignominious move,  so humiliating, it signifies the only thing worse would have been to actually bring it to a vote where Republican leaders were apparently confident it would die. Here s the video via YouTube:If this bill fails to pass it will be a humiliating defeat for Trump and Republicans, but it will be a glorious victory for the American people and the millions who rely on the Affordable Care Act to help get and keep accessible and affordable health insurance.So as Friday approaches, Americans need to urge their Republican representatives to vote against the bill.

Well, that evidence may have surfaced and it may be in the possession of the adult magazine Penthouse or all places.On Tuesday, Penthouse offered  up to $1 million for exclusive rights  to tapes that multiple sources now say exist showing Trump, among other things, paying women to  drain the swamp  on his bed.

He explains that the magazine is not conducting a witch hunt, but that they simply want the truth to be out there. He says the $1 million bounty   the highest they have ever offered   is because it falls in line with the magazine s brand perfectly. If the story is real, which we don t know if it is or not, it really kind of hits at the intersection between politics, scandal and sex, which as a brand both historically and currently is our sweet spot,  Aronowitz told IB Times. For us, this was the type of story that we wanted to jump all over. But at the same time there s been so much floating around   as far as fake news stories   there have been so many people who have just been taking shots at President-elect Donald Trump because he s an easy target, and we as a brand and as an informational source, we didn t want to jump on the bandwagon,  he says. We wanted to make sure this story could be verified, that the murmurings of their being actual video documentation that corroborates the allegations, do exist. For us, this was a very real ask, which is just  Give us some facts, and let us share the real story with our readers and with the public.

" Ted Nugent Breaks Civility Pledge With Unhinged Obama Rant For No Apparent Reason After GOP Rep. Steve Scalise was shot during a congressional baseball practice, provocateur and has been rock star Ted Nugent made a promise to dial down his own violent hate-filled rhetoric.During an appearance on the WABC Radio Show  Curtis & Eboni,  Nugent said that  my wife has convinced me that I just can t use those harsh terms. I cannot, and I will not, and I encourage even my friends-slash-enemies on the left in the Democrat and liberal world that we have got to be civil to each other. Source: SalonFor the man who threatened to kill both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, that pledge lasted just over a month.During a concert in Bonner Springs, Kansas on Friday night, Nugent became unhinged over the President   no, not Trump, the one who s no longer in office and has absolutely zero to do with Nugent s life. He also insulted country music. I was going to play a country song but I still have a (penis) so I can t do that.  And before  Dog Eat Dog,  he praised the president and then told members of the military he was sorry they d had to serve eight years under his predecessor, a commander-in-chief who was an  absolute piece of s***.   And if that offends you, you re a piece of s***. Source: KansasCity.comInteresting to know that Nugent s obsession with Obama has long out-lived the presidency. Then again, in April, Nugent said of Obama,  No! I will never apologize for calling out evil people,  he said, arguing that Mr. Obama  intentionally dismantled the American dream for eight years. One can only imagine what American dream Nugent is referring to, but there might be some clues in this Media Matters compilation of vile racist sputum that has escaped Nugent s mouth in recent years. Nugent might have tried to tone down the rhetoric, but his hate-filled freak flag apparently has to fly. His only hope is that Donald Trump can turn America back into a white man s paradise as it once used to be.

" BREAKING: Republican Senate Hopeful Speaks His Mind, Says Putin Is Right, America Is Evil After more than seven years of Republicans desperately trying to kill everything that is great about this country, like the fact that it s a melting pot or a land of opportunity. Now, one Republican has gone so far as to say that Vladimir Putin is right when he calls the United States evil.We always knew there was a flip-side to Donald Trump  Make America Great Again,  as if America, in its multiculturalism and in its quest for freedom, is somehow no longer great. Now, Roy Moore, who s hoping to replace now Attorney General Jeff Sessions in the Senate, as admitted as much.When The Guardian s Paul Lewis, who was probing the rising popularity of Russian President Vladimir Putin among U.S. conservatives, told Moore that former President Reagan called Russia  the focus of evil in the modern world,  Moore said it wasn t the only one. You could say that very well about America, couldn t you?  Moore responded in the interview published Wednesday. We promote a lot of bad things,  added the former chief justice of Alabama s Supreme Court, specifically citing same-sex marriage.Then he had to, like any loyal Trumpster, thrown in a little love for Vladimir Putin. That s the very argument that Vladimir Putin makes,  Lewis pointed out. Well, then maybe Putin is right,  Moore said.  Maybe he s more akin to me than I know. Source: The HillI guess Moore, who s currently in the lead to be the nation s next Senator, doesn t know that Russia has one of the highest rates of abortion in the world. Republicans really have to do a better job of picking their dictator crushes.You may remember Moore as the Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice and religious nut job who was forced to leave office after refusing to remove a monument of the Ten Commandments as was ordered by a federal court.He took the job back in 2013, but was forced to resign once again for ethics violations, including his refusal to allow gay marriages once the Supreme Court ruled them constitutional.Moore loves him some Donald Trump, though. In two sentences he invoked  God  in reference to Trump, a man who s almost certainly never read the Bible, a whopping four times. God puts people in positions in positions he wants.   I believe he sent Donald Trump in there to do what Donald Trump can do,  Moore said.  More than thinking I can win, it s up to God and God s will. We will see what God would have me do. And here we thought it was bad enough with Jeff Sessions in the Senate. Actually, it was. Now, we ll have Sessions as AG and who knows what kind of nuttery replacing him in the Senate. If there s any consolation at all, it s that we re all getting screwed and the party in charge wants to take away our birth control.Read more:",Fake
"France's Macron says U.S. interests to be harmed by climate deal withdrawal PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday categorically ruled out any renegotiation of the Paris climate accord and said U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s decision to withdraw would harm American interests and citizens.  Macron, who made a televised address in French and English, said Trump had â€œcommitted an error for the interests of his country, his people and a mistake for the future of our planet.â€ â€œI tell you firmly tonight: We will not renegotiate a less ambitious accord. There is no way,â€ said Macron, who took office less than a month ago. Macronâ€™s message was particularly tough compared with  comments after meeting Trump at the Group of Seven summit in Sicily last week, where he had hoped Trumpâ€™s pragmatism would lead him to stick to the deal. [nL8N1IT0MX] â€œFrance believes in you (the U.S.), the world believes in you, but donâ€™t be mistaken on climate; there is no plan B because there is no planet B,â€ Macron said. In a separate address in English, Macron responded to  Trumpâ€™s Make America Great Again slogan, saying, â€œMake the Planet Great Again!â€   Macron called on U.S. researchers and scientists disappointed by Trumpâ€™s decision to come to work in France to  fight climate change.  â€œFrance will put forward a concrete action plan to increase its attractiveness for researchers and companies in the ecological transition sector and will take initiatives notably in Europe and Africa on this subject,â€ Macron said. Macron said that he had asked his government to immediately begin work on the issue. The newly elected president of France called on the remaining 194 signatories to the accord to reaffirm their commitments and said he had agreed with Germany and Italy to take strong decisions in the coming weeks.

"Factbox: Trump plan to dismantle 'Dreamer' program draws strong responses (Reuters) - The Trump administration drew vigorous responses to its announcement on Tuesday it would be ending an Obama-era program that allows children to stay in the United States who entered the country illegally.  Business executives, politicians and rights groups were outspoken in their reactions to the plan to dismantle the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), whose beneficiaries were known as Dreamers. â€œKicking them out wonâ€™t lower the unemployment rate or lighten anyoneâ€™s taxes or raise anybodyâ€™s wages ... Ultimately, this is about basic decency. This is about whether we are a people who kick hopeful young strivers out of America or whether we treat them the way weâ€™d want our own kids to be treated.  Itâ€™s about who we are as a people â€“ and who we want to be.â€ - Former President Barack Obama in a statement  * â€œToday is a cruel day for Dreamers, our families, and all Americans ... President Trump just threw the lives and futures of 800,000 Dreamers and their families, including my own, into fearful disarray, and injected chaos and uncertainty into thousands of workplaces and communities across America. He is using the lives of 800,000 people as pawns.â€ - Lorella Praeli, director of immigration policy for the American Civil Liberties Union * â€œIt is my hope that the House and Senate, with the presidentâ€™s leadership, will be able to find consensus on a permanent legislative solution that includes ensuring that those who have done nothing wrong can still contribute as a valued part of this great country.â€ - Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan in a statement * â€œThis is a sad day for our country. The decision to end DACA is not just wrong. It is particularly cruel to offer young people the American Dream, encourage them to come out of the shadows and trust our government, and then punish them for it ... Itâ€™s time for Congress to act to pass the bipartisan Dream Act or another legislative solution that gives Dreamers a pathway to citizenship.â€ - Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a Facebook post * â€œPresident Obama wrongly believed he had the authority to re-write our immigration law. Todayâ€™s action by President Trump corrects that fundamental mistake. This Congress will continue working on securing our border and ensuring a lawful system of immigration that works.â€ - Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell * â€œI applaud President Trump for phasing out DACA ... The Obama-era program went far beyond the executive branchâ€™s legitimate authority ... President (Barack) Obama unilaterally conferred lawful presence and work authorization, and then President Obama used that lawful-presence dispensation to unilaterally confer U.S. citizenship.â€ - Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton * â€œLetâ€™s lay the truth bare: President Trump has knowingly deceived the American people over the past seven months about his intentions to protect the innocent young men and women of the DACA program ... Now they will be awake at night wondering whether tomorrow will be their last day on American soil.â€ - Javier Palomarez, president of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, in a statement also announcing his resignation from Trumpâ€™s diversity council * â€œWhen people come here to learn, work hard and give back to their communities, we should allow them to stay in the United States.â€ JPMorgan Chase & Co chief executive Jamie Dimon, chairman of the Business Roundtable, a group of CEOs of the nationâ€™s largest companies * â€œDACA was an unconstitutional overreach by the Obama administration that created incentives for children from Central America to take great risks to enter America illegally. The president has given Congress six months to get our act together and fix our broken legal immigration system, end incentives for illegal entry, lawfully protect the Dreamers, and secure our borders.â€ - Republican Senator Ron Johnson, chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee * â€œIn our view, DACA was an unconstitutional abuse of executive authority by President Obama ... Congress should seize this opportunity to come together and forge these much-needed reforms in our nationâ€™s immigration policy.â€ - Statement from the Federation for American Immigration Reform * â€œWe say this even though Microsoft ... cares greatly about modernizing the tax system and making it fairer and more competitive. But we need to put the humanitarian needs of these 800,000 people on the legislative calendar before a tax bill.â€ - Microsoft president Brad Smith in a statement, adding that Microsoft has at least 39 Dreamers and will pay for their legal counsel in fighting to stay in the United States ",Real
" Hereâ€™s Proof That Mainstream Media Helped Trump Win Democrats and other progressives who watched how the mainstream media treated Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have for months suspected that the fix was in for Trump, and now a new report has numbers to back up those fears.Thomas E. Patterson of Harvard Kennedy School s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy analyzed coverage of the 2016 election and they found that coverage of the race often echoed attacks against Clinton from Trump and his Twitter account, drowning out anything positive about the former Secretary of State.There wasn t much in Clinton s general election news coverage that worked in her favor .Stories about her personal traits portrayed her as overly cautious and guarded and ran 3-to-1 negative. News reports on her policy positions trended negative by a ratio of 4-to-1. Everything from her position on health care to her position on trade was criticized, often in the form of an attack by Trump or another opponent. Her record of public service, which conceivably should have been a source of positive press, turned out differently. News reports on that topic were 62 percent negative to 38 percent positive, with Trump having a larger voice than she did in defining the meaning of her career. He was widely quoted as saying,  She s been there 30 years and has nothing to show for it. Even when the media evenly covered Clinton and Trump they often elevated nonsense stories about Clinton to the same level of serious concerns about Trump and his failures. Democrats saw many of these poorly constructed media stories in real time, and complained to the press about  false equivalence,  which allowed Trump to skate by on whether he has the temperament or maturity to be in charge of the world s largest nuclear arsenal.Thanks in large part to media malpractice, we re all going to find out if Trump can handle it.

" Mike Pence Abruptly Bails On PBS Interview, Crumbles Under Russia Pressure (TWEETS) If Donald Trump and his team are trying to pretend that everything is fine and nothing s wrong, they re not doing a very good job.Earlier today, Trump kicked off the morning by indulging in his habitual Twitter habit whenever he s nervous about something. Providing a distraction from former FBI Director James Comey s testimony, Trump decided to announce his pick for a new FBI Director   signaling that Trump is nervous as hell and desperate to take the heat off the Russia scandal. It turns out, his Vice President is also freaking out.Apparently, Mike Pence reacted to the release of Comey s opening statement by abruptly cancelling a scheduled interview   literally right before it was supposed to happen! Now, Pence is cowering and has gone into hiding. Here s what went down, according to PBS:Pence bailed with no warning whatsoever!Comey s released opening statement has clearly taken the White House by surprise, and everyone s in panic mode now. The White House has been on media lockdown since the release of the statement, and Pence s response surely raised suspicions.Pence, without a doubt, cancelled that interview so he wouldn t have to answer questions about Comey   because he could not only further incriminate Trump, but himself as well. Despite the fact that most of the focus has been on Trump, Pence is also in big trouble because of the Russia scandal. Trump s entire administration is in danger if he goes down.What happens tomorrow during Comey s testimony will likely change the entire direction of the Russia scandal, and it already looks as if it is going to mean bad news for Trump. All of the warning signs and red flags are present, and everyone close to Trump is now running for the hills. For Pence to cancel this interview certainly means something fishy is happening, and most of us can t wait to find out.Featured image via Alex Wong / Getty Images",Fake

"Despite tensions, U.S. sees value in New START treaty with Russia WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States sees value in the New START arms control treaty with Russia, despite Washingtonâ€™s concerns about Moscowâ€™s track record on arms control and other issues, senior U.S. officials said on Friday. The remarks by the Trump administration officials, speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity, suggest the treaty will remain in force and the door remains open to pursuing an extension of the accord, which is set to expire in 2021. The New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty gives both countries until February 2018 to reduce their deployed strategic nuclear warheads to no more than 1,550, the lowest level in decades. It also limits deployed land- and submarine-based missiles and nuclear-capable bombers. Reuters has reported that President Donald Trump, in his first call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, criticized the New START treaty, saying it favored Moscow. But one of the Trump administration officials said on Friday the United States was not looking to discard New START. Senior U.S. officials, including U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, have questioned Russiaâ€™s reliability on arms control, citing longstanding U.S. allegations that Russia has violated the Cold War-era Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty. Russia denies treaty violations and accuses the United States of them. The accusations come amid a nosedive in U.S.-Russian relations. U.S. intelligence agencies accuse Russia of meddling in the U.S. presidential election, which Moscow denies, and recent tit-for-tat exchanges between Washington and Moscow include moves to slash each othersâ€™ diplomatic presence. The tensions have reached Syria, where the United States and Russia are backing different forces that are scrambling to claim what is left of Islamic State-held territory. Russia warned the United States on Thursday it would target U.S.-backed militias in Syria if Russian troops again came under fire. Still, a second senior Trump administration official said Friday the United States was seeking ways to improve communication with Moscow and build some degree of trust, which the official described as non-existent. Trump took office saying he wanted to improve ties strained since Moscowâ€™s 2014 annexation of Crimea and the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine, which led Washington to impose sanctions on Russia. Ukraineâ€™s Petro Poroshenko met Trump on Thursday and said afterward that they had a shared vision of a â€œnew levelâ€ of defense cooperation. But the second senior Trump administration official said there had been no decision on whether to provide defensive arms to Ukraine, something Kiev has long wanted.  ",Real

"In Afghanistan, U.S. senators call for coherent policy from Trump  (This story corrects the number of U.S. and other foreign troops in Afghanistan, paragraphs 15, 16.) KABUL (Reuters) - A bipartisan delegation of U.S. senators visiting Afghanistan on Tuesday called for a new strategy from the Trump administration to turn the tide against an increasingly strong Taliban insurgency and end the longest war in U.S. history. The delegation led by Senator John McCain was in Kabul on a regional trip that included two days in neighboring Pakistan. The visit preceded an expected Trump review later in the month of the strategy for the United Statesâ€™ longest war, now in its 16th year, a subject that was largely absent from last yearâ€™s presidential campaign. Since the exit of most foreign troops in 2014, Afghanistanâ€™s U.S.-backed government has lost ground to a Taliban insurgency in a war that kills and maims thousands of civilians each year and has made Afghanistan the second-ranking country in people seeking refugee status abroad last year, behind Syria. McCain said in a Kabul press briefing on Tuesday at NATO-coalition headquarters that â€œnone of us would say that we are on a course to success here in Afghanistanâ€. â€œThat needs to change and quickly,â€ added McCain, a sharp critic of Trump within their Republican party.   McCain was accompanied by U.S. senators Lindsey Graham, Elizabeth Warren, Sheldon Whitehouse and David Perdue on the regional tour. Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, said she came to get â€œthe view on the ground about what is happeningâ€ in Afghanistan. â€œWe need a strategy in the United States that defines our role in Afghanistan, defines our objective and explains how we can get from here to there,â€ Warren said. U.S. officials have told Reuters that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis will present Trump with strategic options for  Afghanistan by mid-July.  Last month, Trump gave Mattis the authority to set American troop levels in Afghanistan, but as commander in chief Trump must sign off on an overall strategy for the war. U.S. security officials have privately said the most likely options will be to increase training and air support by 3,000-5,000 troops for still-inexperienced Afghan security forces, while also tracking down al Qaeda, Islamic State and other global Islamist militants based in Afghanistan.  The commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, General John Nicholson, has said â€œseveral thousandâ€ more foreign troops â€“ mostly trainers -  are needed to break a military stalemate with the Taliban. In 2001, a U.S.-backed military intervention in Afghanistan toppled the Taliban regime, whose ultra-hardline interpretation of sharia (Islamic law) banned most women from public life and executed people not seen as sufficiently pious, such as men with beards not considered long enough. More than 15 years later, about 13,000 U.S. and allied troops remain in Afghanistan as part of a training and advising mission in support of an elected government that has increasingly been losing ground to a Taliban insurgency that now controls or contests some 40 percent of territory. Several thousand more American troops operate under a counterterrorism mission aimed at groups like Islamic State and al Qaeda. ",Real
" Emboldened NRA Threatens New York Times: â€˜Weâ€™re Coming For Youâ€™ (VIDEO) The NRA has a new favorite toy, but there are no bullets involved   except maybe the bullet points they include in their scripts. Dana Loesch has transformed herself from useful Fox News idiot to darling of the Second Amendment, and the NRA is more than happy to put her stern but beautiful face on camera.Earlier this year, Loesch and the NRA put out a video recruiting ad they called  The Clenched Fist of Truth.  It accused the left of  assassinating real news  and using wedge issues like homophobia, racism, and sexism to stifle the views of conservative Americans. In the video, schoolchildren are depicted on a playground just before Loesch says they re being indoctrinated to believe Trump is  another Hitler.  In short, it s disgusting. Civil rights activist DeRay McKesson summed it up:This NRA ad is an open call to violence to protect white supremacy. If I made a video like this, I'd be in jail. pic.twitter.com/LD65yMUMVn  deray mckesson (@deray) June 29, 2017But the backlash was short-lived, and in an environment as rich with news as the Trump era, it was quickly forgotten, despite its gross, dangerous message.Now Dana and the NRA are back with a new ad, equally violent, this time aimed at the New York Times. Loesch carefully phrases her threats as a shot across the  proverbial  bow of the Times, so as to avoid being accused of outright incitement. But the accusations in the video mirror perfectly the paranoia, suspicion, and resentment of Trump fans who want to believe that news they don t like is  fake.  And the final phrase in the video    We re coming for you    is as menacing as anything else the NRA has done.In a near-derailing of the conversation, a few pundits misheard Loesch s use of the word Fisk (a  verb-ing  of the last name of a writer considered easily debunked by right-wingers who disagree with him), thinking instead that she had said  fist.  If that seems like a silly thing to get hung up on, the context clears it up:We re going to fisk the New York Times and find out just what deep rich means to this old gray hag.If you thought that said  fist,  the meaning is changed considerably. Their mistake wasn t just one of hearing, though   the tweet from the NRA accompanying the video uses the hashtag #ClenchedFistOfTruth. The mistake is understandable. Loesch didn t think so: She blew up at a few notable tweeters who made the error.The new, Orwellian video says, in part:We ve had it with your constant protection of your Democrat overlords, your refusal to acknowledge any truth that upsets the fragile construct that you believe is real life.Somebody is confused about what s real and what s not   and it s not the New York Times.Watch the video here:.@DLoesch has a message for the @nytimes:  We're coming for you.

"Trump to meet Australian PM, relations strained over asylum seekers SYDNEY/WASHINGTON (Reuters)) - U.S. President Donald Trump will meet with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on May 4 in New York City as the two nations seek to repair a relationship strained by a row over an asylum seeker resettlement deal. The meeting will be the first between the two leaders. Relations were strained after an acrimonious telephone call shortly after Trumpâ€™s inauguration, during which Trump labeled the Australia-U.S. resettlement swap agree to with former U.S. President Barack Obama as a â€œdumbâ€ deal. Turnbull said the 75th anniversary of the World War Two â€œBattle of the Coral Seaâ€ celebrations in New York City offered a chance for the two nations to â€œreaffirm our allianceâ€. The bilateral meeting will follow a speech by Trump aboard the USS Intrepid, an aircraft carrier turned museum on the Hudson River, to mark the anniversary of the Coral Sea battle,  during which U.S. and Australian troops fought the Japanese, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said. Australia is one of Washingtonâ€™s staunchest allies and troops from the two nations have fought alongside each other in all major conflicts, most recently Iraq and Afghanistan. Late last year, Obama agreed to resettle up to 1,250 asylum seekers held in Australian-funded camps in the South Pacific, in exchange for Australia resettling refugees from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. But in February, Trump criticized the deal, accusing Australia of trying to export the â€œnext Boston bombersâ€ under the agreement, the Washington Post reported.

" Details Are Emerging About The Mooch Firing And It Was Brutal After just 10 days and a few firings under his belt, Donald Trump s brand new communications director got the ax, and as the details are emerging, he was treated almost as badly as he deserved. According to new reports, Anthony Scaramucci had to be escorted from the premises, as if he was caught with his hand in the cash register.Anthony Scaramucci was escorted from White House grounds today after ouster, per source familiar with the scene  Jackie Alemany (@JaxAlemany) July 31, 2017Anthony Scaramucci s ouster from Trump Administration might have been a messy affair for the White House, based on a report from CNN s Jeff Zelany about the now-former Communications Director s was led away from the president s mansion.Zeleny was on with Brooke Baldwin to discuss the reports saying Chief of Staff John Kelly removed Scaramucci from his post over his lack of  discipline.  During his report, Zeleny said Scaramucci was  essentially escorted off the White House property earlier this afternoon. Source: MediaiteWhile it may not be that unusual for an ex-employee to be escorted out of the White House, it s safe to say that during Scaramucci s turbulent and tiny tenure, he didn t make any friends. He was reportedly fired because the new Chief of Staff John Kelly didn t approve of  the Mooch s  insane profanity laced phone call with a New Yorker reporter. Even Donald Trump, who has mocked disabled people and Gold Star families, who goes on Twitter tirades against anyone who stands in his way and who is completely fascinated with women bleeding, thought Scaramucci s language was  inappropriate. Here are some snippets of the call that might explain why: Reince (Priebus) is a fucking paranoid schizophrenic, a paranoiac,  Scaramucci said. He channelled Priebus as he spoke:    Oh, Bill Shine is coming in. Let me leak the fucking thing and see if I can cock-block these people the way I cock-blocked Scaramucci for six months.   And about Steve Bannon. I m not Steve Bannon, I m not trying to suck my own cock,  he said, speaking of Trump s chief strategist.  I m not trying to build my own brand off the fucking strength of the President. I m here to serve the country. It takes a whole new level of disgusting to make people feel sorry for Reince Priebus and Steve Bannon, but that s what we have. As for Scaramucci s unceremonious firing, well, he deserved it.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",Fake
"Trump calls Egypt's Sisi, says keen to overcome obstacles CAIRO (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump called Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Thursday and said he was keen to overcome any obstacles in the way of cooperation, just days after the U.S. said it would withhold some financial aid to Egypt. â€œPresident Abdel Fattah al-Sisi received a phone call tonight from U.S. President Donald Trump who affirmed the strength of the friendship between Egypt and the United States and expressed his keenness on continuing to develop the relationship and overcome any obstacles that might affect it,â€ Sisiâ€™s office said in a statement late on Thursday. On Tuesday, two U.S. sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that Washington had decided to deny Egypt $95.7 million in aid and to delay a further $195 million because it had failed to make progress on respecting human rights and democracy. Egypt, an important regional partner for the United States because of its control of the Suez Canal and its border with Israel, receives $1.3 billion in aid annually and was critical of the U.S. decision. Its foreign ministry said on Wednesday that the decision to withhold aid reflected â€œpoor judgmentâ€ and that it could have â€œnegative implicationsâ€ on achieving common goals and interests between the two countries. The decision reflects a U.S. desire to continue security cooperation as well as its frustration with Cairoâ€™s stance on civil liberties. In particular, a new law regulating non-governmental organizations is widely seen as part a growing crackdown on dissent, said the U.S. sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Egyptian rights activists have said they face the worst crackdown in their history under Sisi, accusing him of erasing freedoms won in the 2011 Arab Spring uprising that ended Hosni Mubarakâ€™s 30-year rule. Egyptian lawmakers have said the NGO law was needed for national security. The Egyptian government has long accused human rights groups of taking foreign funds to sow chaos, and several are facing investigation regarding their funding. Sisi and his Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry met Trumpâ€™s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner in Cairo on Wednesday but neither the presidency nor the ministry mentioned the aid issue in statements released after the meetings.

" WaPo Reporter Calls Literally HUNDREDS Of Charities Searching For Proof Of Trumpâ€™s â€˜Generosityâ€™ We ve heard nonstop from Donald Trump, and his family and campaign, how wonderfully, generously philanthropic he is. He has personally donated millions of dollars to various charities over  a number of years,  to hear them tell it. However, many are extremely skeptical of that claim, as well they should be. David Farenthold, of the Washington Post, has been investigating where at least some of that money has gone, and is coming up damn near empty-handed.Since Sept. 21, Farenthold has been calling charity, after charity, after charity, trying to find even one that s received money from Trump personally. To date, he s called 386 charities, everything from schools to AIDS charities, to religious foundations, and everything in between. Below is just a tiny sample of Farenthold s list:And many more. It s true that there are lot of charities telling Farenthold,  No comment,  but, well, gee, Trump s tax returns could settle that uncertainty. Too bad he won t release them and we have to go about discovering the truth the hard way.But we digress. A ton of other charities are saying,  Never,  though. In fact, between 2008 and now, Farenthold has found maybe $1 million or so in charitable donations from Trump.Trump, however, keeps insisting that he s given millions to charity, and apparently his people told Farenthold that he prefers to give  quietly  so that more charities won t find out and call him. Chris Christie claimed that Trump gave tens of millions of his own money, but Buzzfeed s Andrew Kaczynski says there s no proof of that.In an earlier story, the Post revealed that they d found less than $10,000 in charitable giving over a period of seven years. At the time that story ran, Trump s campaign was saying that there s no way for the press to  know or understand  his giving (again, releasing his tax returns would settle this). Despite a mounting body of evidence against him, the claim is, inexplicably, still there.We call bullshit, and it looks like the Post does too.Farenthold has been posting updates on his quest on Twitter, complete with photos of his notes:I ve been trying to find evidence that @realDonaldTrump gave any $ out of his own pocket between  08 and this May. Results so far: pic.twitter.com/JSggLbJcit  David Fahrenthold (@Fahrenthold) September 21, 2016But that money could still be out there!

"Trump's opponents race to the courthouse to thwart him  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When President Donald Trump announced on Oct. 12 he would stop subsidies to health insurers critical to the Obamacare law, the response from Democratic state officials was swift and predictable: a lawsuit by 18 state attorneys general was filed within 24 hours.  The race to the courthouse in response to presidential actions has become a familiar pattern since Trump took office in January, and early rulings in many of the lawsuits have, at least temporarily, hobbled key parts of the presidentâ€™s agenda.  Many of the Republican presidentâ€™s most significant executive actions, in areas from immigration and transgender rights to energy and the environment, have been impeded by court rulings in cases brought by Democratic state and local officials as well as liberal advocacy groups.  â€œWe are more of a check on this administration than Congress,â€ Democratic New York state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said of state attorneys general.  Similarly, important executive actions taken by Trumpâ€™s Democratic predecessor Barack Obama were stymied by lawsuits filed by Republican state attorneys general, including one eventually decided by the Supreme Court that was intended to protect millions of immigrants in the country illegally from deportation.  Since Trump took office, courts have at least temporarily blocked Trumpâ€™s plans to:  **ban travelers and immigrants from several Muslim-majority countries  **withholdÂ federal funds from so-called sanctuary cities that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities on immigration enforcement  **ban transgender people from serving in the military  **delay implementation of a regulation issued by the Obama administration limiting methane emissions  **put the brakes on an Interior Department rule requiring energy firms to pay more mineral royalties on federal land  **delay compliance with an Obama-era rule aimed at curbing natural gas drilling waste emissions on federal land  **and impede a detained illegal immigrant teenager from obtaining an abortion  Â Â Â  Trump has claimed some court victories, too, including on Oct. 25 when a federal judge in California refused the request by the state attorneys general to force the government to keep the subsidies to insurers under Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, in place as the litigation proceeds. That decision was more the exception than the rule.  ""President Trump remains committed to protecting our national security and to eliminating excessive regulations that, if implemented, would destroy jobs, harm consumers and provide no meaningful benefit,"" a White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said in a statement provided to Reuters. ""The Trump administration is confident in its legal positions and looks forward to arguing -- and winning -- before the federal judiciary,"" the official added.  In response to legal setbacks, Trump has lashed out at the judiciary in ways that even his own Supreme Court appointee Neil Gorsuch called disheartening and demoralizing. Trump called U.S. courts â€œso political,â€ labeled various rulings and proceedings â€œridiculousâ€ and â€œdisgraceful,â€ and disparagedÂ one jurist who ruled against him as a â€œso-called judge.â€  While presidents often face legal challenges over policy initiatives, Trumpâ€™s administration stands out for the number of suits it has encountered so soon after taking power.Â   Trump has faced far more litigation than Obama had at this stage of his presidency. A review of legal database Westlaw showed that in Trumpâ€™s first nine months in office, cities or states filed 24 lawsuits challenging major policy initiatives of the administration. The review showed no similar lawsuits during the same time period of Obamaâ€™s presidency.  Trump also faces numerous suits by advocacy groups and others challenging such actions as his termination of an Obama program that protected people brought into the United States illegally as children from deportation and the authority of a presidential commission formed to investigate alleged voter fraud.  Trump has relied heavily on unilateral executive actions to advance his policy objectives. His fellow Republicans who control Congress have been unable to pass any major legislation he has sought.  Executive actions can be challenged in court more quickly than lengthy federal rule-making procedures, said law professor Jonathan Adler of Case Western Reserve University School of Law.  Obama relied on executive actions during the later years of his presidency after being unable to win congressional approval of key initiatives, and some of those actions drew legal challenges. But early in his presidency, he relied on unilateral actions less often because his fellow Democrats controlled Congress and passed major legislation including the 2010 Obamacare law.  Some legal experts say the haste with which Trump drafted some of his policy initiatives may have helped those challenging the actions because the orders were not sufficiently vetted.  â€œThis administration is more willing to shoot from the hipâ€ when compared with the Obama administration, Adler said.  That is how San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera, a Democrat, saw Trumpâ€™sÂ executive order on sanctuary city funding, which Herrera calculated could jeopardize up to $2 billion in federal funds for his city.  Herrera said he saw Trumpâ€™s action as â€œdesigned to appeal to a part of the administrationâ€™s political base without really having been vettedâ€ by lawyers to ensure it was legally airtight. Herrera won an initial ruling in April blocking the measure, and the case is now pending before an appeals court.  Trumpâ€™s actions have appealed to his conservative political base, while the legal challenges have pleased his liberal critics.  Speaking at an event at New York University, Schneiderman, New Yorkâ€™s attorney general, called Trumpâ€™s first travel ban, signed in January just a week into his presidency, a â€œgalvanizing momentâ€ for Democratic officials.  While lawsuits challenging the presidentâ€™s actions have won some important early victories,Â the litigation onslaughtâ€™s ultimate effect on Trumpâ€™s agenda is not yet clear.  Trumpâ€™s opponents have tended to file suits in jurisdictions where they think they are likely to prevail, and where appeals will be heard in regional federal circuit courts dominated by Democratic-appointed judges.  The final decisions on the cases could be made by the Supreme Court, where Trumpâ€™s appointment of Gorsuch restored a 5-4 conservative majority.  The high court is likely to â€œprove more receptiveâ€ to the administrationâ€™s arguments on issues like immigration, said George Washington University Law School professor Jonathan Turley.  Last week, a federal judge in San Francisco who was appointed by Obama appeared skeptical in a hearing about the challenge by the 18 states to the Affordable Care Act subsidies, illustrating the limits of resistance through litigation.  Alluding to the political aspect of the case, U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria asked rhetorically during a hearing: why â€œhave all these attorneys general rushed to court seeking an emergency ruling against President Trump?â€ Chhabria then ruled in favor of Trump.

" WATCH: Donald Trump Is Considering Gutting Medicare And Giving It To Wall Street If you re on Medicare or close to qualifying for Medicare and you voted for Donald Trump, you re a special kind of stupid who just got screwed.House Speaker Paul Ryan can t wait for rubber stamp puppet Donald Trump to take over the White House.He and his fellow Republicans have waited for years to throw hard-working Americans off a cliff and now they are about to get what they always wanted.The GOP has hated Medicare since President Lyndon Johnson signed the program into law in 1965. Medicare is a single-payer system that Americans pay into every time they get a paycheck. And when they turn 65 they can enroll and get a large part of their healthcare coverage taken care of by the federal government. Over 55 million Americans currently rely on Medicare. The program is fiscally solvent through 2028 and a simple way to make it infinitely solvent would be to apply the payroll tax to all income over $100,000.But none of those facts matter to Trump and the Republicans in Congress.You see, they want to privatize the program, which is code for giving it to Wall Street. And as we all know, Wall Street isn t exactly the best place to keep our money. If President Bush had privatized Social Security, something Republicans also want to do while Trump is in charge, the recession would have wiped out the funds and millions of senior citizens would have been left in dire straits.But Trump minion Kellyanne Conway told PBS on Tuesday that Trump is willing to consider Ryan s plan to dismantle Medicare. President-elect Trump has made very clear that he wants to make good on the promises that we as a nation have made to the seniors who rely upon Medicare, and certainly the lower income Americans who rely upon Medicaid and other entitlements like Social Security, frankly, for those who receive that,  she claimed.Ryan s plan however would raise the the retirement age of Medicare and turn it into a voucher system that won t be guaranteed like the system that we have now. He will, I m sure, take a look at Speaker Ryan s proposal and other proposals,  Conway continued.  In this case, he will go ahead and look at alternatives as long as it does not interfere with what he has said, his commitment to keep the promises to those currently relying on them. Here s the video via PBS. The Medicare remarks are at the 5:20 mark.Trump is already backing away from just about every campaign promise he has made and Medicare is no different.According to Talking Points Memo,During the campaign Trump had vowed that he was  not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid.  Now, his transition website states that he will  modernize  Medicare,  so that it will be ready for the challenges with the coming retirement of the Baby Boom generation   and beyond  and  [m]aximize flexibility for States [sic] in administering Medicaid. In other words, gutting Medicare and handing what s left to Wall Street is on the table, and if Republicans have their way the program will be dead within the next four years.That means every senior citizen who relies on Medicare for their healthcare needs should start preparing for the higher costs, less care, and less government oversight that comes with handing large government programs that work to vultures. And while seniors may get a half-assed version of Medicare, anyone else who hasn t reached retirement will get nothing but a voucher that isn t worth shit.Frankly, if you are a senior citizen or a worker who has paid into Medicare in hopes that it will be there for you when you need it, you re out of luck. And if you voted for Donald Trump and the GOP, you deserve the reaming you are about to receive.Featured Image: Mark Wilson/Getty Images",Fake
"Trump son-in-law Kushner's congressional statement WASHINGTON (Reuters) - I am voluntarily providing this statement, submitting documents, and sitting for interviews in order to shed light on issues that have been raised about my role in the Trump for President Campaign and during the transition period. I am not a person who has sought the spotlight. First in my business and now in public service, I have worked on achieving goals, and have left it to others to work on media and public perception. Because there has been a great deal of conjecture, speculation, and inaccurate information about me, I am grateful for the opportunity to set the record straight. My Role in the Trump for President Campaign Before joining the administration, I worked in the private sector, building and managing companies. My experience was in business, not politics, and it was not my initial intent to play a large role in my father-in-lawâ€™s campaign when he decided to run for President. However, as the campaign progressed, I was called on to assist with various tasks and aspects of the campaign, and took on more and more responsibility.  Over the course of the primaries and general election campaign, my role continued to evolve. I ultimately worked with the finance, scheduling, communications, speechwriting, polling, data and digital teams, as well as becoming a point of contact for foreign government officials. All of these were tasks that I had never performed on a campaign previously. When I was faced with a new challenge, I would reach out to contacts, ask advice, find the right person to manage the specific challenge, and work with that person to develop and execute a plan of action. I was lucky to work with some incredibly talented people along the way, all of whom made significant contributions toward the campaignâ€™s ultimate success. Our nimble culture allowed us to adjust to the ever-changing circumstances and make changes on the fly as the situation warranted. I share this information because these actions should be viewed through the lens of a fast-paced campaign with thousands of meetings and interactions, some of which were impactful and memorable and many of which were not. It is also important to note that a campaignâ€™s success starts with its message and its messenger. Donald Trump had the right vision for America and delivered his message perfectly. The results speak for themselves. Not only did President Trump defeat sixteen skilled and experienced primary opponents and win the presidency; he did so spending a fraction of what his opponent spent in the general election. He outworked his opponent and ran one of the best campaigns in history using both modern technology and traditional methods to bring his message to the American people. Campaign Contacts with Foreign Persons  When it became apparent that my father-in-law was going to be the Republican nominee for President, as normally happens, a number of officials from foreign countries attempted to reach out to the campaign. My father-in-law asked me to be a point of contact with these foreign countries. These were not contacts that I initiated, but, over the course of the campaign, I had incoming contacts with people from approximately 15 countries. To put these requests in context, I must have received thousands of calls, letters and emails from people looking to talk or meet on a variety of issues and topics, including hundreds from outside the United States. While I could not be responsive to everyone, I tried to be respectful of any foreign government contacts with whom it would be important to maintain an ongoing, productive working relationship were the candidate to prevail. To that end, I called on a variety of people with deep experience, such as Dr. Henry Kissinger, for advice on policy for the candidate, which countries/representatives with which the campaign should engage, and what messaging would resonate. In addition, it was typical for me to receive 200 or more emails a day during the campaign. I did not have the time to read every one, especially long emails from unknown senders or email chains to which I was added at some later point in the exchange. With respect to my contacts with Russia or Russian representatives during the campaign, there were hardly any. The first that I can recall was at the Mayflower Hotel in  Washington, D.C. in April 2016. This was when then candidate Trump was delivering a major foreign policy speech. Doing the event and speech had been my idea, and I oversaw its execution. I arrived at the hotel early to make sure all logistics were in order. After that, I stopped into the reception to thank the host of the event, Dimitri Simes, the publisher of the bi-monthly foreign policy magazine, The National Interest, who had done a great job putting everything together. Mr. Simes and his group had created the guest list and extended the invitations for the event. He introduced me to several guests, among them four ambassadors, including Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. With all the ambassadors, including Mr. Kislyak, we shook hands, exchanged brief pleasantries and I thanked them for attending the event and said I hoped they would like candidate Trumpâ€™s speech and his ideas for a fresh approach to Americaâ€™s foreign policy. The ambassadors also expressed interest in creating a positive relationship should we win the election. Each exchange lasted less than a minute; some gave me their business cards and invited me to lunch at their embassies. I never took them up on any of these invitations and that was the extent of the interactions. Reuters news service has reported that I had two calls with Ambassador Kislyak at some time between April and November of 2016. While I participated in thousands of calls during this period, I do not recall any such calls with the Russian Ambassador. We have reviewed the phone records available to us and have not been able to identify any calls to any number we know to be associated with Ambassador Kislyak and I am highly skeptical these calls took place. A comprehensive review of my land line and cell phone records from the time does not reveal those calls. I had no ongoing relationship with the Ambassador before the election, and had limited knowledge about him then. In fact, on November 9, the day after the election, I could not even remember the name of the Russian Ambassador. When the campaign received an email purporting to be an official note of congratulations from President Putin, I was asked how we could verify it was real. To do so I thought the best way would be to ask the only contact I recalled meeting from the Russian government, which was the Ambassador I had met months earlier, so I sent an email asking Mr. Simes, â€œWhat is the name of the Russian ambassador?â€ Through my lawyer, I have asked Reuters to provide the dates on which the calls supposedly occurred or the phone number at which I supposedly reached, or was reached by, Ambassador Kislyak. The journalist refused to provide any corroborating evidence that they occurred. The only other Russian contact during the campaign is one I did not recall at all until I was reviewing documents and emails in response to congressional requests for information. In June 2016, my brother-in-law, Donald Trump Jr. asked if I was free to stop by a meeting on June 9 at 3:00 p.m. The campaign was headquartered in the same building as his office in Trump Tower, and it was common for each of us to swing by the otherâ€™s meetings when requested. He eventually sent me his own email changing the time of the meeting to 4:00 p.m. That email was on top of a long back and forth that I did not read at the time. As I did with most emails when I was working remotely, I quickly reviewed on my iPhone the relevant message that the meeting would occur at 4:00 PM at his office. Documents confirm my memory that this was calendared as â€œMeeting: Don Jr.| Jared Kushner.â€ No one else was mentioned. I arrived at the meeting a little late. When I got there, the person who has since been identified as a Russian attorney was talking about the issue of a ban on U.S. adoptions of Russian children. I had no idea why that topic was being raised and quickly determined that my time was not well-spent at this meeting. Reviewing emails recently confirmed my memory that the meeting was a waste of our time and that, in looking for a polite way to leave and get back to my work, I actually emailed an assistant from the meeting after I had been there for ten or so minutes and wrote â€œCan u pls call me on my cell? Need excuse to get out of meeting.â€ I had not met the attorney before the meeting nor spoken with her since. I thought nothing more of this short meeting until it came to my attention recently. I did not read or recall this email exchange before it was shown to me by my lawyers when reviewing documents for submission to the committees. No part of the meeting I attended included anything about the campaign, there was no follow up to the meeting that I am aware of, I do not recall how many people were there (or their names), and I have no knowledge of any documents being offered or accepted. Finally, after seeing the email, I disclosed this meeting prior to it being reported in the press on a supplement to my security clearance form, even if that was not required as meeting the definitions of the form. There was one more possible contact that I will note. On October 30, 2016, I received a random email from the screenname â€œGuccifer400.â€ This email, which I interpreted as a hoax, was an extortion attempt and threatened to reveal candidate Trumpâ€™s tax returns and demanded that we send him 52 bitcoins in exchange for not publishing that information. I brought the email to the attention of a U.S. Secret Service agent on the plane we were all traveling on and asked what he thought. He advised me to ignore it and not to reply â€” which is what I did. The sender never contacted me again. To the best of my recollection, these were the full extent of contacts I had during the campaign with persons who were or appeared to potentially be representatives of the Russian government.  Transition Contacts with Foreign Persons The transition period after the election was even more active than the campaign. Starting on election night, we began to receive an incredible volume of messages and invitations from well-wishers in the United States and abroad. Dozens of messages came from foreign officials seeking to set up foreign leader calls and create lines of communication and relationships with what would be the new administration. During this period, I recall having over fifty contacts with people from over fifteen countries. Two of those meetings were with Russians, neither of which I solicited. On November 16, 2016, my assistant received a request for a meeting from the Russian Ambassador. As I mentioned before, previous to receiving this request, I could not even recall the Russian Ambassadorâ€™s name, and had to ask for the name of the individual I had seen at the Mayflower Hotel almost seven months earlier. In addition, far from being urgent, that meeting was not set up for two weeks â€” on December 1. The meeting occurred in Trump Tower, where we had our transition office, and lasted twenty- thirty minutes. Lt. General Michael Flynn (Ret.), who became the Presidentâ€™s National Security Advisor, also attended. During the meeting, after pleasantries were exchanged, as I had done in many of the meetings I had and would have with foreign officials, I stated our desire for a fresh start in relations. Also, as I had done in other meetings with foreign officials, I asked Ambassador Kislyak if he would identify the best person (whether the Ambassador or someone else) with whom to have direct discussions and who had contact with his President. The fact that I was asking about ways to start a dialogue after Election Day should of course be viewed as strong evidence that I was not aware of one that existed before Election Day. The Ambassador expressed similar sentiments about relations, and then said he especially wanted to address U.S. policy in Syria, and that he wanted to convey information from what he called his â€œgenerals.â€ He said he wanted to provide information that would help inform the new administration. He said the generals could not easily come to the U.S. to convey this information and he asked if there was a secure line in the transition office to conduct a conversation. General Flynn or I explained that there were no such lines. I believed developing a thoughtful approach on Syria was a very high priority given the ongoing humanitarian crisis, and I asked if they had an existing communications channel at his embassy we could use where they would be comfortable transmitting the information they wanted to relay to General Flynn. The Ambassador said that would not be possible and so we all agreed that we would receive this information after the Inauguration. Nothing else occurred. I did not suggest a â€œsecret back channel.â€ I did not suggest an on-going secret form of communication for then or for when the administration took office. I did not raise the possibility of using the embassy or any other Russian facility for any purpose other than this one possible conversation in the transition period. We did not discuss sanctions. Approximately a week later, on December 6, the Embassy asked if I could meet with the Ambassador on December 7. I declined. They then asked if I could meet on December 6; I declined again. They then asked when the earliest was that I could meet. I declined these requests because I was working on many other responsibilities for the transition. He asked if he could meet my assistant instead and, to avoid offending the Ambassador, I agreed. He did so on December 12. My assistant reported that the Ambassador had requested that I meet with a person named Sergey Gorkov who he said was a banker and someone with a direct line to the Russian President who could give insight into how Putin was viewing the new administration and best ways to work together. I agreed to meet Mr. Gorkov because the Ambassador has been so insistent, said he had a direct relationship with the President, and because Mr. Gorkov was only in New York for a couple days. I made room on my schedule for the meeting that occurred the next day, on December 13. The meeting with Mr. Gorkov lasted twenty to twenty-five minutes. He introduced himself and gave me two gifts â€” one was a piece of art from Nvgorod, the village where my grandparents were from in Belarus, and the other was a bag of dirt from that same village. (Any notion that I tried to conceal this meeting or that I took it thinking it was in my capacity as a businessman is false. In fact, I gave my assistant these gifts to formally register them with the transition office). After that, he told me a little about his bank and made some statements about the Russian economy. He said that he was friendly with President Putin, expressed disappointment with U.S.-Russia relations under President Obama and hopes for a better relationship in the future. As I did at the meeting with Ambassador Kislyak, I expressed the same sentiments I had with other foreign officials I met. There were no specific policies discussed. We had no discussion about the sanctions imposed by the Obama Administration. At no time was there any discussion about my companies, business transactions, real estate projects, loans, banking arrangements or any private business of any kind. At the end of the short meeting, we thanked each other and I went on to other meetings. I did not know or have any contact with Mr. Gorkov before that meeting, and I have had no reason to connect with him since.  To the best of my recollection, these were the only two contacts I had during the transition with persons who were or appeared to potentially be representatives of the Russian government. Disclosure of Contacts on My Security Clearance Form There has been a good deal of misinformation reported about my SF-86 form. As my attorneys and I have previously explained, my SF-86 application was prematurely submitted due to a miscommunication and initially did not list any contacts (not just with Russians) with foreign government officials. Here are some facts about that form and the efforts I have made to supplement it. In the week before the Inauguration, amid the scramble of finalizing the unwinding of my involvement from my company, moving my family to Washington, completing the paper work to divest assets and resign from my outside positions and complete my security and financial disclosure forms, people at my New York office were helping me find the information, organize it, review it and put it into the electronic form. They sent an email to my assistant in Washington, communicating that the changes to one particular section were complete; my assistant interpreted that message as meaning that the entire form was completed. At that point, the form was a rough draft and still had many omissions including not listing any foreign government contacts and even omitted the address of my father-in-law (which was obviously well known). Because of this miscommunication, my assistant submitted the draft on January 18, 2017. That evening, when we realized the form had been submitted prematurely, we informed the transition team that we needed to make changes and additions to the form. The very next day, January 19, 2017, we submitted supplemental information to the transition, which confirmed receipt and said they would immediately transmit it to the FBI. The supplement disclosed that I had â€œnumerous contacts with foreign officialsâ€ and that we were going through my records to provide an accurate and complete list. I provided a list of those contacts in the normal course, before my background investigation interview and prior to any inquiries or media reports about my form. It has been reported that my submission omitted only contacts with Russians. That is not the case. In the accidental early submission of the form, all foreign contacts were omitted. The supplemental information later disclosed over one hundred contacts from more than twenty countries that might be responsive to the questions on the form. These included meetings with individuals such as Jordanâ€™s King Abdullah II, Israelâ€™s Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu, Mexicoâ€™s Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Luis Videgaray Caso and many more. All of these had been left off before. Over the last six months, I have made every effort to provide the FBI with whatever information is needed to investigate my background. In addition, my attorneys have explained that the security clearance process is one in which supplements are expected and invited. The form itself instructs that, during the interview, the information in the document can be â€œupdate(d), clarif(ied), and explain(ed)â€ as part of the security clearance process. A good example is the June 9 meeting. For reasons that should be clear from the explanation of that meeting I have provided, I did not remember the meeting and certainly did not remember it as one with anyone who had to be included on an SF-86. When documents reviewed for production in connection with committee requests reminded me that meeting had occurred, and because of the language in the email chain that I then read for the first time, I included that meeting on a supplement. I did so even though my attorneys were unable to conclude that the Russian lawyer was a representative of any foreign country and thus fell outside the scope of the form. This supplemental information was also provided voluntarily, well prior to any media inquiries, reporting or request for this information, and it was done soon after I was reminded of the meeting. As I have said from the very first media inquiry, I am happy to share information with the investigating bodies. I have shown today that I am willing to do so and will continue to cooperate as I have nothing to hide. As I indicated, I know there has been a great deal of speculation and conjecture about my contacts with any officials or people from Russia. I have disclosed these contacts and described them as fully as I can recall. The record and documents I am providing will show that I had perhaps four contacts with Russian representatives out of thousands during the campaign and transition, none of which were impactful in any way to the election or particularly memorable. I am very grateful for the opportunity to set the record straight. I also have tried to provide context for my role in the campaign, and I am proud of the candidate that we supported, of the campaign that we ran, and the victory that we achieved. It has been my practice not to appear in the media or leak information in my own defense. I have tried to focus on the important work at hand and serve this President and this country to the best of my abilities. I hope that through my answers to questions, written statements and documents I have now been able to demonstrate the entirety of my limited contacts with Russian representatives during the campaign and transition. I did not collude, nor know of anyone else in the campaign who colluded, with any foreign government. I had no improper contacts. I have not relied on Russian funds to finance my business activities in the private sector. I have tried to be fully transparent with regard to the filing of my SF-86 form, above and beyond what is required. Hopefully, this puts these matters to rest. ",Real
"Trump says would meet North Korean leader under right circumstances: Bloomberg WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday said he was open to meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong un â€œunder the right circumstances,â€ according to Bloomberg News. â€œIf it would be appropriate for me to meet with him, I would absolutely, I would be honored to do it,â€ Trump told Bloomberg in an interview, adding, â€œunder the right circumstances I would meet with him.â€ ",Real
"Russia says still likely to back Paris climate deal despite U.S. withdrawal MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia said on Friday it was still likely to back the landmark 2015 global agreement to fight climate change despite the U.S. withdrawal from the pact, but a Kremlin aide said Washingtonâ€™s pull-out left a gaping hole in the deal.   Russia has signed the Paris climate pact but is the biggest emitter of global greenhouse gases not to have yet ratified it. Russian officials have said they need more time to assess its potential impact on their economy and have spoken of drafting a strategy for low-carbon development, fuelling fears among green campaigners Moscow may not ratify the agreement.   Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich said on Friday he did not think that U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s decision to pull his country out of the agreement would prompt Russia to rethink its own stance however.    â€œWe made the decision to join, and I donâ€™t think we will (change) it,â€ the RIA news agency cited Dvorkovich as telling reporters at an economic forum in St Petersburg. â€œThe deal simply amounts to a signal about the unity of countries around a certain theme. I donâ€™t think anyone doubts that the Americans will make environmental policy. We will definitely do this (make environmental policy) regardless of whether we are part of the agreement or not,â€ he added.   Separately, Kremlin aide Andrei Belousov told reporters at the same event that the U.S. withdrawal punched a gaping hole in the pact, rendering it unworkable. Belousov said Russia was analyzing the U.S. move, but said Russiaâ€™s own plans did not depend on the decision of others, including the United States.  â€œI think itâ€™s a great shame because decisions that have been taken should not be changed,â€ he said of the U.S. withdrawal. â€œItâ€™s obvious that without the participation of the United States the Paris agreement will be unworkable because the United States is one of the biggest generators of emissions.â€ President Vladimir Putinâ€™s spokesman said on Thursday that Moscow attached â€œgreat significanceâ€ to the deal despite anything the United States might do.

"Transgender soldiers, veterans shaken by Trump's ban on their service TAMPA, Fla. (Reuters) - After 13 years of military service that included deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, Indiana National Guard reservist Cameron St. Andrew felt crushed on Wednesday by President Donald Trumpâ€™s decision to ban transgender soldiers. The sergeant first class, who transitioned to living as a man while on active duty, said getting kicked out of the military two years before his planned retirement could mean losing many of his pension and healthcare benefits, and even harm his chances of being hired again. â€œWhy serve a country that doesnâ€™t want me? It breaks my heart, to be honest,â€ said St. Andrew, 37, of Indianapolis. Despite the devastating effect Trumpâ€™s move could have on him, he said he was more concerned about younger soldiers who were earlier in their careers and transition. â€œYou pull that rug out from under them after they have this false sense of security, that could really throw them into a downward spiral,â€ he said.  The Republican presidentâ€™s announcement, made through a series of Twitter posts, upended years of efforts to eliminate barriers to military service on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. Just last year, the Pentagon ended a prohibition keeping transgender people from serving openly. Trump, who cited â€œtremendous medical costs and disruptionâ€  for the ban, did not specify how it would be implemented. It remained unclear whether the policy would apply to existing transgender service members or new transgender recruits.  The presidentâ€™s action was condemned by rights groups and some lawmakers in both parties, who called it discrimination with purely political motives. The move was praised by conservative activists and some Republicans. â€œI have a lot of service members that are scared that their careers are over with,â€ said Navy Lieutenant Commander Blake Dremann, who leads a support organization working with actively serving transgender military members. â€œRight now, they still have their jobs and we will continue to work to make sure that policy doesnâ€™t change.â€ The Pentagon said only that it was working on developing guidance following Trumpâ€™s tweets. St. Andrew said he did not know he was transgender when he enlisted, eager to serve his country after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. After an impoverished childhood in a small town in Michigan, he wanted to give back to the nation whose welfare system had kept him clothed and fed. Several years into his military service, he began reflecting on his gender identity. He said he struggled with the anxiety that accompanied the fear of being outed and losing his job. â€œThey pound into you this thing of selfless service,â€ he said. â€œSo you do that for a few years, and then you come out socially or to a few close people and that gives you some relief, but you still have to hide what you are.â€ He said he received support from his commanders and peers through his transition and found that few accommodations were needed. He already was discreet in changing facilities and had trained for the male physical fitness requirements. Still, anticipating changes like Trumpâ€™s ban coming, St. Andrew resigned from full-time service after the November election. He now wonders if his part-time reservist status is in jeopardy. â€œI try to be tough about it,â€ he said, but added: â€œIt breaks your spirit down.â€ â€œTransgender people are serving today knowing that their leader frankly doesnâ€™t trust them,â€ said retired Colonel Sheri Swokowski, 67, of Windsor, Wisconsin, the highest-ranking openly transgender veteran. â€œThe bottom line is that this does great harm to people who simply want to serve their country.â€ Sergeant Sam Hunt, an electrician serving in the Nevada Army National Guard, said people had long referred to him as a man. He thought he could serve openly as such after former Democratic President Barack Obama lifted the transgender ban. Earlier this month, he learned that the Department of Defense had approved his transition to male from female. â€œUntil told otherwise, I will continue serving this nation and state, as I have since 2009,â€ he said in a statement.

" Five Facts About The Obama Economy That Trump Does NOT Want You To Know Trump likes to pretend he was handed  a mess  when he took office. Unfortunately, that s just not true. By the numbers, consumer confidence is the highest in a decade, unemployment is under five percent, and the country has been adding jobs for 80 straight months.Let s compare that to what President Obama inherited   the November before he took office, 533,000 jobs were lost, and up to three quarters of a million jobs were being lost per month during the crisis. That s over half a million jobs lost in a single month. The United States was in the midst of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Obviously voters have short memories, or they d never have given control over the economy back to Republicans after the last fiasco. Hell, even Trump says the economy does better under Democrats.From Bloomberg:Obama took office during the worst recession since the Great Depression, when the economy was losing 750,000 jobs a month and already had lost a record 9 percent of GDP. He completed his two terms with the largest annual gain in the value of the dollar, the biggest annual decrease in household debt as a percentage of disposable income, and the largest annual increases in car sales and hourly wages. His presidency coincided with the second-highest annual gain in home equity and trailed only the Clinton period in deficit reduction as a percentage of GDP.Facts matter.For all their talk of  balanced budgets,  Republicans are really, really bad at balancing budgets. That s probably because they re more concerned with tax breaks for the rich and big business than they are with actually staying grounded in reality.It s well-known that President Clinton is the only modern president to ever balance the budget, and President Obama did the best after him as a percentage of GDP   and that s including the massive stimulus he used to fix our broken economy. The last Republican president, President George W. Bush, increased the nation s debt over 100 percent and left us with the financial crisis.In Trump s world of alternative facts, half the country is unemployed and begging for a savior. That doesn t match up with reality, though. The latest jobs report from the Department of Labor shows the truth   a 4.6 percent unemployment rate, and nearly sixteen million jobs added over the last eight years. I ll remind you again   the economy was losing hundreds of thousands of jobs per month when President Obama assumed office. He saved us.The United States is poised to save $100 billion in healthcare spending over the next decade thanks to Obamacare, studies have shown. Meanwhile, Republicans want to repeal Obamacare for strictly political purposes (likely replacing it with a similar plan   it was a conservative plan to start with, as most progressives favor Medicare-for-all or another form of universal healthcare), which is estimated to cost hundreds of billions  not to mention leaving the American people high and dry when it comes to seeking medical care.You can also thank President Obama for the fact that the United States is still competitive in the automotive industry. His stimulus single-handedly saved American cars. In fact, hundreds of thousands of jobs were added thanks to him, and GM, Ford, and Chrysler all saw significant profit increases thanks to the Obama task force. The Bush administration gets a tiny bit of credit for short-term loans that prevented bankruptcy until Obama assumed office, but that s giving credit holding off slightly on a disaster Bush was initially responsible for. Then President Obama stepped in and fixed it.Featured image via Pool/Getty",Fake
" Second-Largest U.S. Paper Now Wants Readers To Decide If Trumpâ€™s Lies Are Lies (VIDEO) Donald Trump is a consummate liar. He lies so much that it appears that his strategy is to tell enough lies that there s no way the media fact checkers can keep up. Well, the second largest paper in the country, the Wall Street Journal, has thrown in the towel. Their editor-in-chief, Gerard Baker, says that determining if Trump is lying is no longer their job and that it will be up to us. I d be careful about using the word,  lie.   Lie  implies much more than just saying something that s false. It implies a deliberate intent to mislead,  Baker told Chuck Todd on Meet the Press on Sunday.As an example, Baker cited one of Trump s more outrageous lies: When he claimed that thousands of Muslims in New Jersey gathered on rooftops to celebrate 9/11. Baker noted that the WSJ investigated his claim and found it baseless. I think it s then up to the reader to make up their own mind to say,  This is what Donald Trump says. This is what a reliable, trustworthy news organization reports. And you know what? I don t think that s true.  I think if you start ascribing a moral intent, as it were, to someone by saying that they ve lied, I think you run the risk that you look like you are, like you re not being objective,  he said.Source: Think ProgressHere s the video:The Wall Street Journal was purchased by News Corp in 2007. They are the same company that owns Fox News. Fox News, with its previous  We Report, You Decide  motto, deserves much of the blame for the fact that the media no longer does its job and instead relies on the  both sides  fallacy in covering real news. For example, there is only one legitimate side when discussing climate change, yet Fox has somehow convinced Americans that it s up for debate.Despite Fox s insistence that they present both sides of the story, they don t, and they are hardly beacons of truth. According to reports, about 60 percent of the facts Fox reports are complete lies and Fox viewers are far more likely to vote Republican than are other cable news watchers.While Fox News targets voters, the Wall Street Journal targets the business world. If Trump s lies go unchecked on Wall Street, it could wreak havoc with our financial markets.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video ",Fake

" Top Intel Dem Rips Trump For Kissing Putinâ€™s A**s: â€˜No Art To This Dealâ€™ (TWEETS) Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) is the Ranking Member of the Intelligence Committee in the House of Representatives. He is also a rising star in the era of Donald Trump, due to his clever, sharp tweets, and open contempt for the man baby  president.  Every chance Rep. Schiff gets, he appears on cable news shows   and even on political comedy shows   in order to let the world know how dangerous he thinks Trump is in the White House.

"U.S. lawmakers propose making it easier to meet auto fuel rules WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan pair of Michigan lawmakers introduced a bill to make it easier for automakers to comply with federal fuel efficiency requirements, as the Trump administration considers softening standards that require nearly doubling the fuel economy of the U.S. new vehicle fleet by 2025. The proposal, introduced late on Wednesday, would extend the life of fuel economy credits that would currently expire after five years, lift a cap on transferring credits between car and truck fleets and award automakers credits for emissions reductions not measured by existing test procedures. The measure proposed by Representatives Fred Upton, a Republican, and Debbie Dingell, a Democrat, would also grant an industry wish by requiring that the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reconcile their respective fuel economy standards so the industry can comply with just one set of rules. The proposal comes on the heels of a bipartisan measure to create a single federal standard for self-driving cars, also backed by the industry, that is on track to passage.  The Union of Concerned Scientists said the harmonization legislation and a similar bill introduced in the Senate would allow manufacturers to make vehicles that are on average 3 miles a gallon less efficient in 2021. The group estimated that would result in additional U.S. oil consumption of 350 million barrels of oil, costing drivers $34 billion and an additional 155 million metric tons of greenhouse gases. The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing General Motors Co, Toyota Motor Corp, Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) and others, praised the bill for â€œrecognizing the consumer benefits that can come from better alignment of government programs.â€ The group noted there were significant differences between how the EPA and NHTSA award and allow use of credits. Last week, automakers told U.S. regulators they should revise fuel efficiency mandates because the standards do not reflect how cheap gas prices are affecting consumer demand. Automakers want changes in the 2021-2025 requirements that would make it easier for them to comply with fuel economy standards. Former President Barack Obamaâ€™s administration finalized rules in 2012 to double the fleetwide average fuel economy to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025, but the EPA revised the target to 51.4 mpg based on rising truck sales. The Obama administration said the rules would save motorists $1.7 trillion in fuel costs but cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years ",Real
"North Korea not ready to meet with South Korea in Russia: agencies MOSCOW (Reuters) - Politicians from North and South Korea will not hold direct talks in Russia on Monday about Pyongyangâ€™s nuclear and missile program despite attending the same event and being urged to do so by Moscow, Russian news agencies said on Sunday. Valentina Matviyenko, speaker of Russiaâ€™s upper house of parliament, is due to discuss the missile crisis in separate talks with a deputy head of North Koreaâ€™s legislature and the head of South Koreaâ€™s parliament on the sidelines of a congress of parliamentarians in St Petersburg on Monday. Moscow has called on the two countries to use the opportunity to have their own direct talks to try to narrow their differences.  But the RIA news agency on Sunday cited Piotr Tolstoi, the deputy speaker of the Russian lower house of parliament, and an unnamed member of North Koreaâ€™s delegation as saying there would not be any direct talks. The unnamed North Korean delegate was quoted as saying that U.S. pressure on Pyongyang and U.S. and South Korean military exercises meant preconditions for such talks had not been met. Konstantin Kosachyov, head of the upper house of parliamentâ€™s foreign affairs committee, said Moscow would try again on Monday to encourage the two delegations to hold face-to-face talks despite the lack of progress. Russian news agencies quoted him as saying that the North Korean delegation had so far declined to hold such talks, while the South Korean delegation had said it was ready for such a meeting. â€œWe will definitely not try to coerce or talk somebody into anything,â€ the Interfax news agency cited Kosachyov as saying.  â€œ(But) it will be pity, both on the human and political level, if another opportunity to de-escalate tensions in relations between North Korea and South Korea is missed.â€ North Koreaâ€™s nuclear tests and missile launches have stirred global tensions and prompted several rounds of international sanctions at the U.N. Security Council. A de-escalation plan, backed by Russia and China, would see North Korea suspend its ballistic missile program and the United States and South Korea simultaneously call a moratorium on large-scale missile exercises, both moves aimed at paving the way for multilateral talks.

"Whirlpool's washer war is balancing act for Trump  Clyde, Ohio (Reuters) - In the middle of Whirlpool Corpâ€™s bustling washer factory in northern Ohio there is an empty patch of concrete floor - a reminder of a $60 million expansion plan the appliance maker says fell victim to unfair foreign competition.  â€œWe cleared that out to hold more plastic molding machines,â€ says Daniel Oâ€™Brien, the factoryâ€™s vice president of operations. Whirlpool (WHR.N) halted the upgrade two years ago blaming South Koreaâ€™s LG Electronics Inc (066570.KS) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) for the setback. In a string of trade cases the Benton Harbor, Michigan-based manufacturer has argued the Koreans have undercut its U.S. business by exporting washers at unfairly low prices.  Since the Nov. 8 presidential election, Whirlpool has been fighting with renewed vigor, seeking more protection. President Donald Trumpâ€™s administration is the first one in decades that openly says it is searching for ways to hit back at foreign producers it finds are hurting domestic manufacturers.  But the washer case has a twist.  Since the election, both Korean producers have announced plans for big U.S. factories and that confronts the administration with a dilemma: how do you weigh interests of a U.S. manufacturer against investment plans of foreign competitors and which jobs are more important?  Whirlpoolâ€™s sprawling complex in Clyde - stretching nearly a mile from corner to corner - employs 3,200 well-paid union workers.  Now, LG is spending $250 million to build a 600-worker factory in Tennessee, while Samsung is investing $380 million to renovate an old Caterpillar Inc. factory in South Carolina that will employ 950. Both states are dominated by Republicans.  The investment in Tennessee has attracted support from local, state and federal officials, many of whom attended a groundbreaking ceremony in August, LG spokesman John Taylor said. â€œWe got terrific feedback from Commerce Secretary (Wilbur) Ross when he was at the groundbreaking.â€  Both LG and Samsung said their investments followed years of preparations, though Taylor said the timing of the announcement was â€œopportuneâ€ given Trumpâ€™s focus on manufacturing jobs.  Whirlpool remains the leader in the $7.5 billion U.S. washer market, but the rivals are closing in. The companyâ€™s brands, which include Maytag and Amana, account for just under 35 percent of domestic sales, down from over 38 percent in 2013, according to Stevenson Coâ€™s TraQline, a market research company. Over the same period, Samsungâ€™s share doubled to just under 20 percent, while LGâ€™s held steady around 16 percent.  The Korean producers argue innovation and more choice for the consumers rather than prices have driven their growth and say Whirlpoolâ€™s five straight years of record results weaken its case. Both companies deny they have violated U.S. trade laws.  â€œWhirlpoolâ€™s stock price more than tripled from 2012 to 2015. It is hard to see how such an industry is suffering material injury,â€ LG lead outside counsel Daniel Porter told the International Trade Commission, a federal agency that investigates trade issues, in a meeting earlier this year.  The Commerce Department declined to comment for this story because of the pending ITC case brought by Whirlpool.  Nevertheless, the Korean manufacturers are nervous. At the groundbreaking for the LG plant in August, the company pulled forward the date for completion by six months to the first quarter of 2019 â€” an extremely fast construction window for such a factory.  Whirlpool, which won two anti-dumping cases against the Korean firms in the past four years, took its fight one step further and filed a â€œsafeguard petitionâ€ in May, seeking broader protection than anti-dumping measures provide.  A safeguard targets imports from any country and the petitioner does not need to prove that the goods are being sold at unfairly low pricesâ€”just that the influx of products is disrupting the U.S. market and causing â€œserious injuryâ€ to domestic producers.  The ITC is due to vote on Thursday whether washing machine imports cause harm to U.S. producers. If it rules in Whirlpoolâ€™s favor, the commission will recommend remedies, such tariffs, import quotas or other measures, to Trump in early December.  U.S. producers have seldom sought such protections, in part because they are often challenged at the World Trade Organization. The last case was in 2002, when President George W. Bush imposed tariffs of up to 30 percent on certain imported steel products.  Clark Packard, a policy analyst at the R Street Institute, a libertarian think tank, says the safeguards should be reserved for rare instances of unforeseen surges in imports, but that the â€œatmosphere is ripe in Washingtonâ€ for these cases.  Whirlpool says it is seeking broader protection because the Korean producers were able to avoid anti-dumping tariffs by moving production from country to country. After the ITC imposed anti-dumping tariffs against South Korean washers made in South Korea and Mexico in 2013, the production moved to China and when the ITC slapped tariffs on those washers, LG and Samsung began making them in Vietnam and Thailand.  â€œThe only plausible explanation for these moves was to dodge the U.S. anti-dumping orders and avoid duties,â€ said Whirlpool Chairman Jeff Fettig, in testimony before the ITC in September.  As part of the safeguard petition, Whirlpool also wants curbs on the import of large washing machine components, arguing otherwise the Korean companies could merely set up assembly plants running primarily on foreign parts.  While the case has worked its way through the system, the mood in Clyde has darkened as investment plans were scaled back.  Leading the way up to a cluster of idle machines, Oâ€™Brien, the plant vice president, says: â€œThis is $3 million worth of machinery â€” and it only runs two or three hours a day.â€  The equipment was installed in 2015 before the other investments were put on hold, he notes. Elsewhere in the plant, a giant poster, painted by a worker, shows an anthropomorphic Whirlpool washing machine, pushing past stumbling washers labeled LG and Samsung - a far more upbeat take on the rivalry than the mood on the factory floor.  â€œEveryone here feels the frustration,â€ says Lori Frasure, a 30-year-old factory worker, â€œitâ€™s a frustration that weâ€™re not all playing by the same rules.â€  The only other large domestic manufacturer of washing machines is GE Appliances, now owned by Chinaâ€™s Haier Group (1169.HK). Earl Jones, the companyâ€™s senior counsel, says GE is not party in the Whirlpool case, but it has also cut investments and reassigned workers inside their appliance manufacturing complex in Louisville, Kentucky.  â€œWeâ€™re on the record of supporting their petition.â€  Follow Trumpâ€™s impact on energy, environment, healthcare, immigration and the economy at The Trump Effect: www.reuters.com/trump-effect  ",Real
" Stephen Colbert SCORCHES Jeff Sessionsâ€™ Racism In One Brilliant Tweet Late Show host Stephen Colbert is no fan of Donald Trump and his administration of bigots. Therefore, he was, of course, incensed at Attorney General Jeff Sessions  racist attack on a sitting federal judge regarding Trump s bigoted Muslim Ban.Judge Derrick Watson infamously blocked Trump s Muslim Ban 2.0, and in the decision he said the whole thing read like a   neon sign flashing  Muslim ban, Muslim ban. On Thursday, Sessions went full dog whistle when he criticized Judge Watson s decision, saying the following: We are confident that the president will prevail on appeal and particularly in the Supreme Court, if not the Ninth Circuit. So this is a huge matter. I really am amazed that a judge sitting on an island in the Pacific can issue an order that stops the president of the United States from what appears to be clearly his statutory and Constitutional power. Of course, that brings back the fact that accusations of racism have dogged Sessions for decades, and rightly so. He is a throwback to a time we really should be trying to get away from, and here he is, the nation s top law enforcement officer. Shameful, but true. Therefore, Stephen Colbert s tweet on the matter is more than fitting:Sessions is ""amazed"" an ""island in the Pacific"" judge can block the travel ban. Just like how I'm ""bewildered"" a ""racist elf"" can be AG.  Stephen Colbert (@StephenAtHome) April 21, 2017That is exactly what Jeff Sessions is   a stone cold racist.

" Republican Favorability Of Putin Goes Through The Roof Because Russia Helped Trump Win This is disgraceful and totally un-American.Ronald Reagan is rolling in his grave after a new poll revealed that Republicans now see Russia as our friend and admire Vladimir Putin far more than we did just two years ago.A YouGov/Economist poll released in December shows that Putin s favorability has soared by 56 points among Republicans, likely bolstered by the fact that Russia helped Donald Trump win the election in November. Clearly, Republicans can be bought by murderous dictators as long as that dictator helps their party seize power.Trump specifically asked the Russians to continue meddling in our political process and they did. Trump has since stacked his cabinet with pro-Russia nominees and Republicans have joined Trump in defending Russia despite a CIA assessment concluding that Russia did interfere in our election to help Trump.Putin s net favorability among Republicans now stands at -10 percent, up significantly from the -66 in 2014. Democrats, meanwhile, still despise Putin.Um, wow Net favorability of Putin:Democrats July 2014: -54 Dec 2016: -62Republicans July 2014: -66 Dec 2016: -10(YouGov/Economist)  Will Jordan (@williamjordann) December 14, 2016Here is Republicans and Democrats on Vladimir Putin since July 2014. pic.twitter.com/s4I6FY5cbt  Will Jordan (@williamjordann) December 14, 2016In addition, Republicans now see Russia as a friend. Again, apparently it is easy to draw Republicans to the dark side. If Russia had rigged our political process decades ago, that whole Cold War thing would not have happened because Russia would have had a puppet in the White House long before now.It s not just Putin.Here are perceptions about whether Russia is a friend to the US or not, since 2011. pic.twitter.com/CrtVEB4Vws  Will Jordan (@williamjordann) December 14, 2016As a net rating, the  friendly  rating for Russia among Republicans has swung from low of -75 in 2014 to -21 today. https://t.co/PrbOLQFY5a  Will Jordan (@williamjordann) December 14, 2016That s also a 54-point swing from two years ago.It is absolutely deplorable to watch the Republicans Party bend over for Putin just because Russia helped their party win the election. If anything, Republicans should be outraged and concerned.Trump will now be a puppet who owes Russia favors. Trump has since chosen a close friend of Putin s as Secretary of State and wants to end sanctions against Russia. Trump also expressed his intention to possibly abandon NATO, which would open the door for Russia to be more aggressive toward Europe with no United States to challenge them.The only reason why Republicans are fawning over Russia and Putin is because they would not have won the White House without their assistance. This is a sad time for our country. The political party that once saw Russia as our mortal enemy is now happy to be in Putin s pocket. And that means we can expect more Russian meddling in 2020 unless the GOP and Trump face consequences.Featured image of Donald Trump by Joe Raedle/Getty, image of Vladimir Putin by Thierry Chesnot/Getty",Fake

"Texas business leaders call on lawmakers to drop 'bathroom bill' AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - A group of Texas business leaders urged state lawmakers on Monday to abandon plans to pass a bill to restrict bathroom access for transgender people, calling such a measure bad for the economy. The Republican-dominated legislature begins a 30-day special session on Tuesday with 20 items on the agenda, including one of the â€œbathroom billsâ€ that have been a flashpoint in U.S. culture wars. Supporter of the legislation have said it is a common-sense measure that protects public safety. Critics call it discriminatory. Texas, the most powerful Republican-controlled state, could lose about $5.6 billion through 2026 and businesses could find it difficult to recruit top talent if such a measure is enacted, according to the stateâ€™s leading employer organization. â€œThe distraction of a bathroom bill pulls us away from being competitive as a state,â€ Jeff Moseley, chief executive of the Texas Association of Business, told a rally outside the Capitol.  â€œOn this discussion, conservatives can disagree with conservatives,â€ said Moseley, whose group has typically aligned itself with the stateâ€™s Republican leaders. The legislation restricts access to places like bathrooms and locker rooms based on the gender listed on peopleâ€™s birth certificates and not the gender with which they identify. A similar law in North Carolina, partially repealed in March, prompted the relocation of sporting events and economic boycotts that was estimated to have cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars. The stakes are higher in Texas, which has an economy larger than Russiaâ€™s. A bill similar to North Carolinaâ€™s passed the Texas Senate in the regular session and was killed by pro-business Republican leaders in the House, who ran out the clock on the measure. The bathroom billâ€™s main backer, Republican Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, a social conservative who sets the state Senateâ€™s legislative agenda, has said economic losses would be inconsequential. â€œ(The Texas Republican majority) want to maintain separate restrooms, locker rooms and shower facilities for men and women and boys and girls, and they donâ€™t care if the media thinks it is politically incorrect,â€ his political campaign said in a statement on Monday. Republican House of Representatives Speaker Joe Straus and companies including IBM, American Airlines, Apple and Southwest Airlines have spoken out against the bill. â€œOn the bathroom bill, there is no real compromise because even the most mild bill is going to be interpreted as discriminatory,â€ said Mark Jones, a political science professor at Rice University in Houston.

" Pence Joins Trumpâ€™s NFL Whinefest, Leaves Colts Game In A Huff Over Police Brutality Protests People like to pretend that Mike Pence is the grown-up in the room compared to Donald Trump s brash childishness from the White House. However, he proved that wrong on Sunday, when he left the Indiana Colts football game because a few of the players on the team opposing the Colts chose to take a knee during the national anthem to protest police brutality against black and brown Americans. Taking a leaf out of Trump s playbook, Pence tweeted:I left today's Colts game because @POTUS and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem.  Vice President Pence (@VP) October 8, 2017While everyone is entitled to their own opinions, I don't think it's too much to ask NFL players to respect the Flag and our National Anthem  Vice President Pence (@VP) October 8, 2017Just like Trump, Pence forgets the meaning of the First Amendment, and seems to think that his position gives him the right to try to bully owners, players, and ultimately the National Football League into following his orders. Further, it is worth noting that the Colts were playing the San Francisco 49ers, which is the former team of Colin Kaepernick, the man who started this protest before being blacklisted from the NFL for taking a stand against police brutality against people of color. Further, Pence and Trump admitted that they used the situation to divide the country and make some kind of point on the taxpayers  dime   because of course we paid for Pence to travel to that football game. For one thing, the press was kept in the van, in anticipation of Pence stirring the pot and then leaving:The media pool was kept in the vans ahead of the game instead of being led in with VPOTUS. https://t.co/NXIFZCp3fb  Vaughn Hillyard (@VaughnHillyard) October 8, 2017FLAG: Was Pence leaving Colts game a political stunt?

" Sally Yates: I Refused To Lie And Say Muslim Ban Wasnâ€™t Based On Religion When We All Know It Is Former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates was fired by Donald Trump when she refused to defend his travel ban, which we all know is nothing more than a Muslim ban. On Tuesday, she explained to attendees at the Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado why it was that she couldn t bring herself to argue that this bill wasn t based on religion. I came ultimately to the conclusion that our defending this travel ban would require me to send lawyers of the Justice Department to court to say this ban had nothing to do with religion   (that) it was all based on national security, nothing to do with religion,  Yates told the audience. And I did not believe that to be a defense that was grounded in truth and I couldn t send Department of Justice lawyers in to defend something based on a defense that I did not believe was grounded in truth. The Trump administration did not consult the Justice Department while crafting the ban and Yates didn t even know about it until she got a call from her principal deputy who had read about it in the New York Times. That was on a Friday evening. She studied the bill as much as she could over the weekend and then convened a meeting with  lifetime civil department staffers, holdover employees from President Obama s time in office and newly-hired Trump staff.  Her question to them was simple: How would you defend Trump s travel ban? We went around the table with my asking them,  All right, tell me why you think this is lawful? How are we going to defend this?'  Yates said.  Without revealing our internal discussions here, at the end of that, I was not comfortable that it was, in fact, lawful or constitutional and kept the senior Trump appointee back to tell him I was very uncomfortable where we were. After speaking to several other people about the Muslim ban, Yates said she just couldn t defend it. So, Trump fired her like he fires anybody who doesn t kiss his a** and tell him that he can do no wrong. Nevertheless, she persisted.Watch Sally Yates explain why she couldn t say Trump s Muslim ban was anything other than just that, a Muslim ban, here:1/  That s how we found out about it at @TheJusticeDept:Read abt it on the internet.   @SallyQYates talks #TravelBan pic.twitter.com/xTHWJHHULQ  Josh Weinberger (@kitson) June 27, 2017Featured image via video screen capture",Fake
" As Trump Collapses, Clinton Donations SURGE As Donald Trump s support has crumbled in the past month, donations to Hillary Clinton s presidential campaign have been surging. In the most recent reports filed with the Federal Elections Commission (FEC), Clinton has just reported her best month yet of fundraising.The campaign ended July with $58.5 million on hand, up from $44.4 million on June 30, according to its report released by the Federal Election Commission on Saturday. Its $52.3 million raised and $38.2 million spent were both the highest of any month this cycle.Even more positive for Clinton, most of those donors were first time small-dollar donors, of the sort that have been so important to other candidates like Senator Bernie Sanders and President Obama. 58% of the money Clinton raised in July was under $200. Before, those donors represented 31% of her base.Clinton has spent most of the money on campaign ads in swing states, while Trump only announced plans for a meager advertising buy in the last week. He did not advertise during the Olympics, which most experts believe is a crucial time to reach prospective voters who aren t news junkies. Clinton bought time for an ad which highlighted Trump s habit of outsourcing the manufacturing of his clothing lines to other countries.According to the RealClearPolitics current average of polling, Clinton has a 5.7% lead against Trump nationally. He hasn t had the lead in a single national poll since the week of July 22, when the Republican National Convention was underway.Since then Trump has been involved in a series of controversies, including his repeated attack on the family of a fallen U.S. soldier. Allegations of underhanded dealings and connections to the Russian government eventually led to the ouster of his top campaign official, Paul Manafort. Trump has brought in the head of the bigoted website Breitbart.com, Stephen Bannon, to run his campaign in an emergency shakeup.Featured image via Flickr",Fake

"Michigan state House approves carrying concealed guns without permit (Reuters) - Legislation to allow Michigan gun owners to carry a concealed handgun without a permit was approved in the state House of Representatives on Wednesday, in a move that follows the lead of a dozen other states. The package of four bills, which cleared the Republican-controlled House with support from a handful of Democrats, now moves to the Senate, also dominated by Republicans.  It was not immediately clear whether Michiganâ€™s Republican Governor Rick Snyder supports the bill. But the measure, if also approved in a Senate vote, could automatically become law 14 days after reaching the governorâ€™s desk unless he vetoes it. The legislation would lift a requirement that handgun owners obtain a concealed pistol license with a $100 fee to legally carry the weapon in public.  Handgun owners also would be allowed carry a concealed pistol in public without the firearms training that is currently mandated.  Advocates framed the issue as upholding a U.S. constitutional right to bear arms. â€œWe all know criminals are not paying fees, taking classes and waiting for approval to come in the mail before they begin carrying guns,â€ Michigan state Representative Michele Hoitenga, sponsor of the bill, said in a statement.  The legislation â€œlevels the playing field for honest people,â€ she said. Opponents of the bill criticized it as dangerous. Twelve other U.S. states already allow gun owners to carry their weapons without a concealed-carry permit, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Most are conservative-leaning with Republican-majority legislatures but Vermont, where Democrats control the statehouse, is among the 12. â€œThe states that have eliminated the permit requirement are basically making it easier to carry a gun in public than drive a car,â€ said Hannah Shearer, a staff attorney with the San Francisco-based Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Legislation introduced in the U.S. Congress this year would, if approved and signed by President Donald Trump, require all states to allow firearm owners to carry their guns under the regulations of their home state, even if visiting elsewhere. For instance, a person allowed to carry a concealed firearm without a permit in North Dakota could do so when visiting California or New York state, where permits are required, Shearer said. ",Real

"Blocking abuse of lower small business rate slows U.S. tax overhaul WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A plan by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans to slash taxes on so-called pass-through businesses is testing lawmakersâ€™ ability to design rules to prevent wealthy people from dodging taxes by paying a lower rate meant to help small businesses grow. Businesses ranging in size from the corner Mom-and-Pop shop to accounting firms and industrial conglomerates are called pass-throughs because their profits flow to owners and are taxed as individual income, often at the top 39.6 percent rate. By contrast, publicly held corporations have their own top corporate income tax rate of 35 percent, at least on paper. Corporate profits are further taxed when they flow through to shareholders as dividends. Republicans including House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan have vowed to get tax legislation to Trumpâ€™s desk before the end of 2017, but pass-throughs are one of the thorniest issues in their effort to enact the first comprehensive tax overhaul since 1986. The Republican timeline is in doubt because of complexities posed by pass-throughs and other difficult issues that could roll the debate into 2018 and beyond, analysts and lobbyists said. Trump and Republicans, who control the House and Senate, want to give pass-throughs their own tax rate of 15-25 percent, saying such a low rate would help unleash economic growth by leaving owners with more money to hire and invest. The danger with this proposal is that high-income people who pay the top individual tax rate could reap enormous windfalls simply by reclassifying their wages and salaries as pass-through business income to qualify for the new low rate.       Tax avoidance schemes along these lines could erase up to $584 billion from government coffers over the next decade, the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimated. The nonpartisan Tax Foundation estimates that over 28 million businesses are organized as pass-throughs. Income from them has been taxed at the same rates as wages and salaries since the individual income tax was enacted in 1913. â€œThese are tough, tough questions. And politics aside, theyâ€™re what has held up tax reform for so long,â€ said one corporate lobbyist, who asked not be identified. â€œThis is an area where thereâ€™s still a lot of discussion and no solution.â€ To address this, policymakers are looking at limiting how much of a business ownerâ€™s income should get pass-through treatment. But thatâ€™s hard to define because pass-throughs range from sole proprietorships and partnerships to S-corporations. Rebecca Boenigk, chairman and chief executive of the pass-through manufacturer Neutral Posture, worries that Congress could choose solutions that inadvertently add complexity for small businesses and deny business owners the capital they need. â€œThereâ€™s always a rule thatâ€™s put into place to take care of the 1 percent of people who are bad, and that rule ends up affecting the 99 percent of people who are good,â€ said Boenigk, who began making ergonomic furniture with her mother 28 years ago in their family garage.    One proposal under consideration would apply the pass-through rate to only 30 percent of a business ownerâ€™s income, while giving taxpayers the option of qualifying for more favorable treatment from the Internal Revenue Service, congressional sources and lobbyists said. The remaining 70 percent of income would be taxed at the higher individual rate.   The National Federation of Independent Business, a small business lobbying group in Washington, wants Congress and the Trump administration to apply the lower tax rate to 50 percent of a business ownerâ€™s income. Some lobbyists warn against the idea of allowing business owners to qualify for a higher percentage of income for the pass-through rate with the IRS, saying an additional layer of complicated procedures could backfire and encourage fraud.    Keith Hall, president of the National Association for the Self-Employed, would rather see business owners pay individual tax on a portion of their income set by living standards data for the geographical areas in which they live. But if lawmakers adopted the 70-30 approach, Hall said, higher earners should see the larger portions of their income qualify for the pass-through rate to maximize the amount of capital they can invest in their businesses.     Other proposals would limit the pass-through rate according to the business ownerâ€™s capital or stock value; exclude income from partnerships engaged in â€œpersonal servicesâ€ such as law, accounting, medicine and engineering; or exclude passive income from royalties, rents, dividends and income. With Republicans pushing to overhaul the tax code before year-end, analysts say tax legislation could include a number of anti-abuse rules. â€œLawmakers arenâ€™t going to know which anti-abuse measures work. If theyâ€™re risk-averse, they may throw in more than one,â€ said Scott Greenberg, senior analyst at the Tax Foundation. ",Real
"Republican vows 'all hands on deck' in Georgia congressional runoff WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A political newcomer who thrilled Democrats with a strong finish in a Georgia congressional race - despite attacks by President Donald Trump - will face an experienced Republican candidate in a June runoff election for a district long dominated by the party. Democrat Jon Ossoff drew 48.1 percent of the vote in Tuesdayâ€™s special election, just shy of the 50 percent needed to win the most closely watched U.S. congressional race since Trump took office in January. Some saw the election, held to replace new Health Secretary Tom Price, as a test of the Republican presidentâ€™s political strength. Ossoff, 30, was the top vote getter in a field of 18 candidates, 11 of them Republicans, in a suburban Atlanta district that has sent Republicans to Congress since the 1970s. Republican Karen Handel, 55, a former Georgia secretary of state, won 19.8 percent, and will face Ossoff in the June 20  runoff. The runoff presents a stiffer challenge. If Ossoff gets the support of the other Democratic candidates, he would have 49 percent, said Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez. However, Perez said the party would target up to 35,000 Democrats who voted in Novemberâ€™s presidential election but not on Tuesday.  â€œWe have an army of volunteers,â€ he told CNN. Handel, who said Trump called to congratulate her on Wednesday morning, dismissed Ossoff as a well-funded novice who would flounder as Republicans consolidated support behind a single candidate. â€œWe know that this is an important race, and itâ€™s going to stay in the hands of a Republican,â€ Handel told CNN. â€œIt is all Republicans, all hands on deck.â€  Demographic changes have made Georgiaâ€™s affluent 6th Congressional District more competitive for Democrats.  Trump won the district by only 1.5 percentage points in November against Democrat Hillary Clinton, who drew support from its many college graduates. Republican U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said the race showed how the South was changing. â€œThis should be a wake-up call for the Republican Party in the South,â€ he told NBCâ€™s â€œTodayâ€ show. Ossoff, a former congressional staffer and documentary filmmaker, ran on a pledge to â€œMake Trump Furious.â€ Trump jumped into the race in its final days with attacks on Twitter poking fun at Ossoff for not living in his own district and for attracting support from Hollywood celebrities.  The president weighed in again on Wednesday with a tweet saying, â€œIt is now Hollywood vs. Georgia on June 20th.â€ In response, Ossoff portrayed Trump, a New York businessman who had never held public office, as the Washington insider.  â€œFolks in Washington tend to overstate their influence in local races like this,â€ he told MSNBC. â€œThis comes down to grassroots intensity.â€     White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Trump would campaign in Georgia for Handel â€œif neededâ€ but dismissed the race as overhyped. â€œThe Democrats went all-in on this race,â€ Spicer told reporters. â€œThey lost.â€ ",Real
" The World To Trump: F*ck Off, You Did Not â€˜Inherit A Messâ€™ From Obama (VIDEO) With the White House plagued with scandals, Donald Trump has repeatedly blamed the  dishonest media  for not giving him proper credit after he  inherited a mess  from former President Barack Obama.We have some bad news for Mr. Trump. The world strongly disagrees with him. Trump has been in office for only 168 days and yet he has already had a major impact on how the world sees the United States.MSNBC s Chris Matthews highlighted a new Pew Research Center poll which shows that Trump and many of his key policies are broadly unpopular around the globe, and ratings for the U.S. have declined steeply in many nations.Trump is wildly unpopular worldwide while Obama s popularity soars above the former reality show star s ratings. 37 nations were included in the poll, showing that a median of just 22% has confidence in Trump to do the right thing when it comes to international affairs. In contrast to the final years of Barack Obama s presidency, a median of 64% expressed confidence in Trump s predecessor to direct America s role in the world.Watch: This highlights why Trump has exhibited so much jealousy toward his popular predecessor. Trump will never be respected like Obama was and is. Trump s jealously toward Obama was displayed long before he took the oath of office. Obama would never bash the U.S. media and intelligence agencies while on foreign soil. In fact, he never did that in the U.S., but Trump does and did. Obama retaliated against Russia s meddling in our 2016 presidential election by ordering 35 Russian diplomats to leave the country. Obama imposed sanctions against the foreign hostile government, while Trump s administration would like to lift them.The former reality show star is  fake news  and that can be seen daily in his Twitter timeline but he is good at projection.By the way, Trump is not expected to confront Russian leader Vladimir Putin today at the G20 summit meeting about his country s interference in our presidential election.Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images.",Fake
" Sarah Palin Gets Annihilated On Twitter For Whining About Elizabeth Warren Using â€˜Fight Like A Girlâ€™ Line At least Elizabeth Warren isn t a quitter like Sarah Palin.After all, Sarah Palin could have remained in office as Governor of Alaska and continued to build a political career. Instead, Palin quit halfway through her term to pursue reality stardom and has become nothing more than a desperate grifter who relies on donations to her super PAC to maintain her lifestyle.That s not  fighting like a girl,  it s conning like a conman.Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, however, is still fighting for women and the poor and middle class in Congress and could very well run for president in 2020. Warren has been fighting for the American people for years and has become a symbol of the women s movement.That s why Warren posed with the  Fearless Girl  statue on Tuesday and posted the image on Twitter with the caption,  Fight like a girl. Fight like a girl. pic.twitter.com/qGTn46jS9W  Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) April 18, 2017And of course, Sarah Palin whined about it by crying to Breitbart.Palin claimed that she s a  legit fighter  for women and accused Warren of urging women to  claim victimization  when asked about her use of the phrase. I don t know. Coming from liberals who urge women to claim victimization,  Fight like a girl  just doesn t sound the same as when legit fighters for equality say it, mean it, live it, and will never give it up. Basically, Palin thinks fighting like a girl means never speaking up when you re being treated like shit.Women in this country have had to deal with rape culture, discrimination, and pay inequality for far too long, not to mention all the attacks on reproductive rights coming from right-wingers like Palin herself.How can one claim to  fight like a girl  when one doesn t even bother to fight for women rights to make their own choices about their own bodies?As usual, Palin is nothing more than a complete hypocrite who is bitching about a phrase she has never lived up to.Even Twitter users slammed Palin for attacking Warren.@SarahPalinUSA Sorry Sara but you didn t create the quote , you stole it and claimed it as yours #GovernorQuitter  Joey Mitchell (@JoeyM728) April 19, 2017@SarahPalinUSA Before you know it, she ll be hanging out in Alaska claiming that she can see Russia from her backyard.

"Senators grill U.S. education secretary on proposal to slash budget WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos faced hostile questions from a Senate committee on Tuesday as she tried to win lawmakers over to President Donald Trumpâ€™s proposal to slash her departmentâ€™s funding by 13 percent. DeVos, a Republican who narrowly won Senate approval for her post in February after strident opposition from Democrats and a few fellow party members, testified before the Senate appropriations subcommittee on education about the proposed budget Trump submitted to Congress last month. Trumpâ€™s plan to cut $9 billion from the Education Departmentâ€™s budget would â€œimprove educational opportunitiesâ€ and shift the federal role in education, DeVos told the panel. â€œI understand those figures are alarming for many,â€ she said. â€œHowever, this budget refocuses the department on supporting states and school districts in their efforts to provide high-quality education to all our students.â€ Democrats took turns asking DeVos about the bigger budget line-items and talking about students who they say could be hurt by large spending cuts. The most pointed exchanges were on whether private schools that receive federal funds would have to agree not to discriminate against students. DeVos would only repeat that schools taking federal money must abide by U.S. law. But Senator Jeff Merkley and his fellow Democrats said she was refusing to answer the question because federal law is unclear in many areas of possible discrimination, such as the rights of transgendered people. Lawmakers are expected to alter Trumpâ€™s proposed budget before voting on it.  The subcommitteeâ€™s chair, conservative Republican Roy Blunt, said he believed Congress would not approve the budget as proposed. â€œSuch a significant cut to the departmentâ€™s budget is likely untenable,â€ Blunt said, pressing specifically to preserve funds for technical programs, work-study financial aid and the Special Olympics. Civil rights groups and Democrats say the budget would send public dollars to private companies, disband after-school care, hurt schools in poor neighborhoods, shrink the ranks of teachers, and make it harder for many to afford college.  DeVos is currently working on major transformations in student loans. The budget suggests changing income-based repayment plans and ending loan forgiveness for workers in the public sector, which DeVos said would clear up confusion around the loans. With the stated aim of giving parents more choices for their childrenâ€™s education, DeVos and Republicans support charter schools, which are publicly funded but operate independently, frequently by corporations, as well as subsidies to help pay private-school tuition. Many Republicans on the panel applauded the budgetâ€™s proposal to boost such â€œschool choiceâ€ programs. But the subcommitteeâ€™s senior Democrat, Patty Murray, said the cuts â€œhighlight the ways that the policies and priorities you and President Trump are pushing would hurt students, hurt communities, and represent a clear broken promise to workers and the middle class.â€  ",Real
" Senate Dems To GOP: Take Healthcare Hostage, Thereâ€™s NO WAY Weâ€™re Working With You If you thought Senate Democrats were going to capitulate and work with Republicans after eight years of obstruction and a MASSIVE popular vote loss, you thought wrong. At least for now, Senate Dems are talking pretty big   and if the voters hold them to that path of action, it wouldn t make political sense not to continue.At issue right now is the Republican plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act as soon as they gain power, without designing a replacement first. The Republican strategy is this: repeal the ACA immediately, but with a delay until it goes into place. There is debate about how long that delay should be. Then, in the meantime, after it is repealed but before the repeal takes full effect, design a new system and pass it with partial Democratic support.In short, they want to take the healthcare of millions of Americans hostage on the off chance that Democrats will fold and do what they want.Not a chance, says Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. In an interview with the Washington Post, he had some interesting things to say about the Republican strategy moving forward: We re not going to do a replacement,  Schumer said of the Senate Democratic caucus.  If they repeal without a replacement, they will own it. Democrats will not then step up to the plate and come up with a half-baked solution that we will partially own. It s all theirs. Republicans appear to be calculating that the looming prospect of millions losing insurance will force Dems to cooperate with them to pass a replacement that covers far fewer people and offers less in consumer protection than the ACA does. (They may need Dems to pass a replacement, because some conservatives may not vote for anything that spends and regulates to expand coverage.) But if Democrats do hold the line against anything far short of the ACA, they may be able to leverage Republicans into replacing it with something that is not nearly as regressive as the GOP replacement might otherwise have been.This is what Schumer is now vowing to do. Asked directly if Democrats would refuse to support anything that falls significantly short of the ACA in terms of expanding social welfare, Schumer said:  The odds, after they repeal without any replacement, of us sitting at the table to do something that will chop one arm off instead of two is very small. Schumer said that in this scenario, Democrats would not toss Republicans a lifeline.  They broke it, they own it,  Schumer said.  All the problems in the health care system that they blamed on Obamacare will now be in their laps. We re going to make sure that we say things would have been a lot better, had they been thoughtful and careful and worked with us to fix Obamacare. And the fact remains that all Republican options on the table are horrible, anyway. They want to repeal the individual mandate immediately for political points   but removing the individual mandate will cause the price of health insurance to spike as the pool of those insured rapidly shifts to older, sicker people. Market instability will cause insurers to flee the markets, and is estimated to increase the number of uninsured to 60 million:The study found that 22.5 million people would lose coverage directly due to repeal of the law s subsidies, Medicaid expansion, and its individual requirement to carry health insurance.Another 7.3 million would become uninsured because of the ripple effects of market upheavals. That could happen if insurers lose confidence in the Republican promise of a replacement and abandon the individual market. A key industry worry is that a repeal law would get rid of subsidies and mandates but still leave insurers on the hook for covering people with health problems.The number of uninsured people would rise to nearly 59 million in 2019, and the nation would have a higher uninsured rate than when the ACA passed in 2010, the study found. (Source)That s right   if Republicans move forward with their current plan, they re going to leave things in a worse mess than they were before, and they re already expecting Democrats to fix it so that they can take all the credit. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has now made it clear: If this is the Republican plan, Democrats aren t playing ball. The health of millions is at stake and if Republicans don t have a replacement, Democrats aren t going to let them play political games until they do.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",Fake
" Germany Releases Memo Showing How Destructive A â€˜President Trumpâ€™ Would Be To Our Economy Donald Trump s economic proposals would be disastrous for the economy. That s the conclusion that Germany s economic ministry concluded in an internal memo, first reported on by the German magazine Der Spiegel.According to the memo, if Trump were to be elected president of the United States his economic policies would lead to  a shrinking gross domestic product, fewer jobs and higher unemployment.  What s more, the memo says that Trump s economic policies violate both U.S. and international law. In a more blunt statement, the memo says that Trump s proposals are  not feasible  and that they do not  provide the foundation for a realistic economic policy. So to summarize, Germany s economics ministry has officially concluded that Trump s proposals would destroy the U.S. economy and are completely divorced from reality. That s an incredibly strong condemnation from one of the United States  strongest allies, and one of the most powerful economies in the world, and according to analysis by the Tax Policy Center, Trump s proposals would reduce income revenue by $2.6 and $5.9 trillion dollars over the next 10 years. In September, the economics research firm Oxford Economics found that if elected president, Trump s economic proposals would cause the economy to be $1 trillion dollars smaller in the year 2021 than experts are currently expecting.It isn t particularly easy for economists to create a complete prediction of what the future would look like after a Trump administration. There are many factors, such as his policies regarding immigration, that contribute to the various possible outcomes. Obviously, it s not yet clear what policies he will put into place when. That being said, it appears more and more to be a matter of finding out exactly just how bad these possible outcomes are than a matter of whether they re bad or not   a Trump presidency would unquestionably be an economic disaster for the United States.Featured image from  Alex Wong/Getty Images",Fake
"Ex-punk rocker challenges Ted Cruz for Senate  AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - A punk rocker-turned-congressman from Texas announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate seat held by Republican Ted Cruz on Friday, making him the first prominent Democrat to challenge the former presidential candidate.  Robert Francis â€œBetoâ€ Oâ€™Rourke, a Spanish-speaking, Irish-American representing a predominantly Latino district that includes the border city of El Paso, is considered a long shot in the Republican-dominated state, analysts said.  MORE FROM REUTERS Connecticut may become first state to allow deadly police drones Wayward tabby returning to Denver home after 800-mile adventure British robot helps autistic children with social skills But Oâ€™Rourkeâ€™s outsider credentials are expected to add flair to the 2018 Senate race in Texas, where a Democrat has not won a state-wide election in more than 20 years. Beto is short for his name in Spanish, Roberto.  â€œThis is Cruzâ€™s to win. He has got a national fundraising network so he will have all the money in the world,â€ said Cal Jillson, a political science professor at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.  In a campaign launch from El Paso shown on Facebook Live, the Ivy-League educated Oâ€™Rourke, 44, pledged to fight for veterans, shun corporate money and serve only two terms in the Senate if elected, saying it was in the peopleâ€™s best interest to have fresh blood in Congress.  Oâ€™Rourke, who played guitar and provided vocals for the punk band Foss in the 1990s, also took a shot at Republican President Donald Trump for his hard-line stance on immigration, vowing to â€œfight when necessary against a president who is focused on building walls, or conducting military immigrant round-ups.â€  Oâ€™Rourke and Republican Congressman Will Hurd of Texas gained attention on social media earlier this month by live-streaming the journey they made together from Texas to Washington and billing it as 1,600-mile bipartisan road trip. They rented a car and took the trip due to a winter storm that shut East Coast airports.  Polls rate Cruz as the most popular politician in the state among Texans. Oâ€™Rourke does not have much political support outside his base of El Paso, a western Texas city closer to San Diego, California than to Houston.  Another possible challenger to Cruz is Democratic U.S. Representative Joaquin Castro, analysts said.  Just ahead of Oâ€™Rourkeâ€™s announcement, Texas Republican Governor Greg Abbott announced he was endorsing Cruz. Cruz backers later sent out a fundraising email, saying Oâ€™Rourke was out of touch with Texas values.  â€œBetoÂ Oâ€™RourkeÂ will have the full support of the mainstream media and a Washington establishment willing to do everything in their power to see Ted Cruz defeated,â€ the email said.

Sometimes people lie,  That guy lied, they found out he lied.  Then there s somebody who lies because they can t quite stay inside the boundaries of truth,  C.K. began.  Then you have a liar, somebody who it s almost like a problem, they lie a lot. Then you have a lying sack of sh*t,  he continued as the audience became more excited.  That s somebody who just they just lie, they like it, he likes it. He just goes,  Heh heh, that wasn t even true, wasn t even true.  Then I said  they were liars.  It s just insane. It s just gross. He s just a gross, crook, dirty, rotten, lying sack of sh*t, that s how I feel. The audience wildly applauded but Colbert alerted C.K. that there was at least one guy in the crowd who voted for the liar. Louis, there s a guy who voted for him up there,  Colbert said.That s when C.K. noted that Trump voters were duped. Trump voters were hurt the most because Trump lied to them and they believed him. Look if you voted, that s the guy he lied to,  C.K. said.  He didn t lie to me. He lied to him, he didn t lie to me. Everybody else was like  yeah, no that s not true.  But that guy bought it.

" Florida Republican To Black Voters: â€˜If You Donâ€™t Like It Here, Go Back To Africaâ€™ Paul Congemi, a Republican candidate running for mayor of St. Petersburg, Florida, sent a clear message to black voters at a forum on Tuesday when he told mayoral opponent Jesse Nevel and members of the Uhuru Solidarity Movement to  Go back to Africa. Congemi claims to have been a life-long Democrat who switched to Republican after former President Barack Obama showed his support for gay marriage. Nevel, on the other hand, is white and has been running his campaign on the slogan  Unity through reparations,  and has also spoken out against gentrification and police brutality.Then there is the Uhuru Solidarity Movement, a socialist organization of white people who believe that the key to ending racial inequality is through reparations, but Congemi sees things from different angle. Mr. Nevel you and your people talk about reparations. The reparations that you talk about, Mr. Nevel, your people already got your reparations. Your reparations came in the form of a man named Barack Obama,  Congemi said at Tuesday s forum.  My advice to you, if you don t like it here in America, planes leave every hour from Tampa airport. Go back to Africa. Go back to Africa. Go back,  he continued, repeatedly pointing at the crowd and later making motions to exit.His statement was met with a combination of shock and disgust, with one woman in the crowd shouting  Get out of here!  after Congemi s comment about Barack Obama.Rick Kriseman, the sitting mayor of St. Petersburg, was also critical of the candidate s words, claiming on Wednesday that Congemi s statement was hateful, bigoted, and unacceptable toward black and gay Floridians. Jesse Nevel also saw the move as tactless, saying that Congemi s comment reflects a segment of my community. I ve met plenty of other people who feel that way. That s why I feel that it s important for those of us in the white community to take a public stand with reparations. In typical Republican fashion, Congemi tried to weasel his way out of the firestorm he had created, telling the Washington Post that he has  nothing against African Americans who are doing their best here in America,  and that his remarks were only aimed at those who are pushing for reparations. He even referred to Nevel as a  self-hating white man. The controversy doesn t seem to have slowed Congemi down, and he claims that anyone who believes he is racist simply misunderstood his comments. Even if he loses this time, he s not going to stop. I ll run again in 2019 and, God willing, if I m alive in 2021, I ll run then, too,  Congemi said.  I intend to keep running and running and running. Featured image via video screen capture from YouTube",Fake
" Conservative â€˜Christianâ€™ Leader Kept A Sexual Assault Secret For A Republican Lawmaker Conservatives should shun Tony Perkins for this.Earlier this week, Ohio GOP state Rep. Wes Goodman was busted for carrying on a same-sex affair in his taxpayer funded office, forcing him to tender his resignation.But there is an even worse transgression in Goodman s past, one that should drag the Family Research Council leader to hell with him.As it turns out, Goodman once fondled an 18-year-old without consent in his hotel room at the Ritz Carlton in Washington D.C.The teen s stepfather was quick to alert Perkins of the incident via email, warning him that continuing to endorse Goodman would be a mistake. If we endorse these types of individuals, then it would seem our whole weekend together was nothing more than a charade,  the teen s stepfather wrote. Trust me,  Perkins replied.  This will not be ignored nor swept aside. It will be dealt with swiftly, but with prudence. Perkins withdrew his support and suspended Goodman from the Council for National Policy. Going forward so soon, without some distance from your past behavior and a track record of recovery, carries great risk for you and for those who are supporting you,  Perkins wrote to Goodman.But Perkins failed to report the crime to law enforcement. Instead, he kept quiet and allowed a sexual predator to gain public office. In fact, even the board members of the Council for National Policy knew about the crime because Perkins informed them, and none of them did a damn thing about it.And this all happened just two years ago in 2015. Surely, Perkins and the board members he told can still be prosecuted for failing to report Goodman to the authorities.Because they definitely should be.Featured Image: Wikimedia",Fake
" Snowflake Trump Actually Screams At White House Televisions, Proving He Is Mentally Unfit To Be President Donald Trump is literally the old man who yells at his television set.

Witch Hunt  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 16, 2017That s right. Clearly, Trump is the leaker he has been complaining about all these months.As we all know, Trump s mental health has been a hot topic since long before Election Day. And now that Trump has been in office for five months, we can say for sure that he is mentally unfit to be president. Even the Army field manual says that Trump has no business being commander-in-chief of the armed forces.For instance, Trump has outbursts of anger and is obsessed with promoting himself. He makes unfounded accusations and attacks anyone who criticizes him. He lies constantly and makes promises he does not keep. He also lacks self-control and is incredibly selfish and hateful while taking paranoia to whole new level.And now we are learning from Trump s own advisers that whenever news about the Russia and obstruction of justice investigations appear on any television inside the White House, Trump stops and yells at it and rants about how he is the victim of a conspiracy.According to the Associated Press,Trump advisers and confidants describe the president as increasingly angry over the investigation, yelling at television sets in the White House carrying coverage and insisting he is the target of a conspiracy to discredit   and potentially end   his presidency. Some of his ire is aimed at [Deputy Attorney General Rod] Rosenstein and investigative special counsel Robert Mueller, both of whom the president believes are biased against him, associates say.Can you imagine being an employee at the White House just sitting there minding your own business and all of sudden this senile old man walks up and starts yelling at the television just because a certain story is on? That has to be scary and worrying. And it should definitely worry the American people enough to call for Trump s ouster.

" WATCH: Hypocrite Bill Oâ€™Reilly Accuses Liberals Of â€˜Seditionâ€™ For Calling Trump Illegitimate Clearly, Fox host Bill O Reilly wasn t paying attention over the last eight years.Because if he had been paying attention, he would know that conservatives sought to delegitimize President Obama repeatedly.The principle claim, of course, was that President Obama was not born in the United States, a conspiracy theory that Donald Trump adopted for his own gain and continued to repeat during the campaign. Republicans in Congress also repeatedly attempted to sabotage the country in order to make Obama a one-term president and even after winning a second term Republicans continued to refuse to work with him.In fact, Republicans went so far as to pledge allegiance to foreign leaders like Vladimir Putin and Benjamin Netanyahu rather than acknowledge Obama as their president.Republican racism and hatred toward President Obama divided America for eight years, yet conservatives like O Reilly have the gall to blame him for it. And now he is accusing those who oppose Donald Trump of sedition.During an interview with a very unfunny Dennis Miller, who claims to be a comedian, O Reilly asked if he believes the effort in opposition to Trump is  anti-American. Do you believe that this whole movement to delegitimize Donald Trump is anti-American?  O Reilly asked.  Would you say it s that bad? Miller cracked another pathetic  joke  that not even O Reilly could laugh at and O Reilly continued by going a step further. These people want to delegitimize the whole election, the whole presidency, and I think it borders on sedition,  he said.Miller then blamed President Obama for how divided the country has become even though Republicans were the ones who divided it in the first place and Trump continued to divide it on the campaign trail.Here s the video via YouTube.Bill O Reilly, like most conservatives, are hypocrites. Over the last eight years, they desperately tried to convince the American people that President Obama was illegitimate in order to sabotage his presidency and I don t remember O Reilly throwing out words like  sedition  to describe that un-American effort.The fact is that Trump lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes, and his electoral win is one of the smallest on record. Furthermore, the Russians helped Trump by launching cyber attacks against our country and spreading propaganda. And Trump has done nothing but suck up to Putin, proving that he ll be a Russian puppet instead of the American president. But you ll only hear O Reilly whine about how people aren t lining up to kiss Trump s ass. Well, he better buckle up because turnabout is fair play because if anyone is a true illegitimate president it s Donald Trump. And unlike the birther conspiracy, there is plenty of proof backed up by the intelligence community.Featured Image: Screenshot ",Fake
"U.S. sticks to global transparency initiative after Congress repeal WASHINGTON/OSLO (Reuters) - The United States remains committed to the â€œprinciples and goalsâ€ of the global transparency initiative to fight corruption in managing revenues from oil, gas and mineral extraction, it said on Wednesday. There were doubts about U.S. participation in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) after Congress killed the â€œresource extraction ruleâ€ that required companies such as Exxon Mobil to disclose taxes and other fees paid to foreign governments, such as Russia. The EITI, which was founded in 2003, and which the U.S. joined in 2014, sets a global standard for governments to disclose their revenues from oil, gas, and mining assets, and for companies to report payments made to obtain access to publicly owned resources, as well as other donations. â€œThe (U.S. Interior) Department remains committed to the principles and goals ofÂ EITIÂ including transparency and good governance of the extractive sectors...,â€ Heather Swift, a spokesperson for Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, said in an email to Reuters. Industry sources familiar with EITI implementation said the United States was already pulling out in all but name, but could formally remain a member until its progress assessment scheduled to start in April 2018. Azerbaijan left the group in March after the EITI board, chaired by Swedenâ€™s former prime minister Fredrik Reinfeldt, suspended its membership over concerns about limits on civic freedoms. The EITI initiative was primarily aimed at developing nations and most of its members are in Africa. But Britain, Germany and Norway also joined, while France and Australia have also expressed interest. Democratic Senator Ben Cardin and former Republican Senator Richard Lugar, authors of legislation encouraging U.S. participation in EITI, said withdrawal would harm national interests. â€œSuch a retreat is a retreat from our values, which give America its strength and its moral leadership in the world,â€ they said in a joint statement. Jonas Moberg, head of EITIâ€™s secretariat in Oslo, said the United States continued to be the part of the global initiative, but if it decided to leave, it wouldnâ€™t be the end of the initiative, now being implemented in 51 countries. â€œShould the administration of President Trump decide to bring an end to EITI implementation, we are not concerned that it would be a decision followed elsewhere,â€ he added in an email to Reuters. The International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM), which represents 23 leading mining companies, has said companies that work in EITI member countries will still have to abide by strict disclosure rules, despite the recent U.S. legal changes.

"Trump delays announcement on whether U.S. embassy to be moved to Jerusalem ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (Reuters) - President Donald Trump will not announce a decision on Monday on whether he will again delay moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, a White House spokesman said, despite Mondayâ€™s deadline for doing so. An announcement on the decision will be made â€œin coming days,â€ White House spokesman Hogan Gidley told reporters aboard Air Force One as Trump was returning from a trip to Utah. Trump had been due to decide whether to sign a waiver that would hold off relocating the embassy from Tel Aviv for another six months, as every U.S. president has done since Congress passed a law on the issue in 1995. Senior U.S. officials have said that Trump is expected to issue a temporary order, the second since he took office, to delay moving the embassy despite his campaign pledge to go ahead with the controversial action. But the officials have said Trump is likely to give a speech on Wednesday unilaterally recognizing Jerusalem as Israelâ€™s capital, a step that would break with decades of U.S. policy and could fuel violence in the Middle East. They have said, however, that no final decisions have been made. â€œThe president has been clear on this issue from the get-go; that itâ€™s not a matter of if, but a matter of when,â€ Gidley said. The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state, and the international community does not recognize Israelâ€™s claim on all of the city, home to sites holy to the Jewish, Muslim and Christian religions.

"Democrats working on independent Russia probe WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats on the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee have been undertaking their own investigation, without Republicans, on what they term â€œRussiaâ€™s malign influence around the world,â€ a spokesman for the Democratic side of the committee said on Wednesday. Sean Bartlett, a spokesman for Senator Ben Cardin, who has been leading the effort, said the Democrats are preparing a â€œmajor reportâ€ on how Russia seeks to sow distrust and confusion, promote radical voices on divisive issues and gain leverage, while eroding support for democracy and institutions. The investigation was first reported by The Daily Beast. It comes as a handful of Republican-led congressional committees, including the Senate and House of Representatives Intelligence Committees, as well as Special Counsel Robert Mueller, investigate alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and whether there was collusion between Republican President Donald Trumpâ€™s campaign and Moscow. Trump has denied any collusion. Moscow denies meddling. While the Foreign Relations Democrats are not looking into the U.S. contest, they said they had discovered Russian-led efforts to influence elections in many countries. â€œThe report describes how these efforts are led by the governmentâ€™s security services and buttressed by state-owned enterprises, Kremlin-aligned oligarchs, and Russian criminal groups that have effectively been nationalized by the state,â€ Bartlett said in an emailed statement. The committeeâ€™s investigations have included contacts with foreign governments. Ukraine, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland are among countries that have discussed Russian meddling. Committee Republicans said they were aware of the investigation, but not involved. â€œWe are aware that Senator Cardin is developing a report on Russian efforts to interfere in European elections, but his staff has not yet shared it with us,â€ said Micah Johnson, a spokeswoman for Senator Bob Corker, the committeeâ€™s Republican chairman. It was not clear when the report might be released publicly. ",Real
" Harvard Law Professor Calls For Electoral College To Dump Trump Donald Trump is a threat to the continuing survival of our nation and democracy. And the only thing that can stop him is the Electoral College.That s why Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig is openly calling upon the Electoral College to save us from this abomination that has made a mockery of our Constitution without even setting one foot inside the White House yet.Most Americans would agree that the Electoral College is an outdated part of our election that should be removed. But in this instance, it the last hope America has to keep Trump and his racist minions from destroying our country.In an op-ed for the Washington Post, Lessig points out that the Founding Fathers adopted the Electoral College as an additional check on our elections to make sure that demagogues and con artists like Donald Trump don t get to be president.Hillary Clinton currently has more than a 2 million vote lead over Trump in the popular vote, which means the will of the American people has been trampled by an electoral system that Republicans may very well have rigged this year, which is why Jill Stein has raised enough money to trigger a recount in three battleground states.On December 19th, the electors will meet to cast their votes for president and vice-president. And when they do, they have a chance to put the rightful winner of the 2016 Election in the White House.According to Lessig, the Electoral College  is not meant to deny a reasonable judgment by the people. It is meant to be a circuit breaker   just in case the people go crazy. In this election, the people did not go crazy. The winner, by far, of the popular vote is the most qualified candidate for president in more than a generation. Like her or not, no elector could have a good-faith reason to vote against her because of her qualifications. Choosing her is thus plainly within the bounds of a reasonable judgment by the people. The framers left the electors free to choose. They should exercise that choice by leaving the election as the people decided it: in Clinton s favor.In short, electors need to do the right and moral thing and vote for Hillary Clinton, even if it means being fined for voting their conscience.Over 4 million Americans have already signed a petition asking the Electoral College to vote for Clinton. Fell free to sign it by clicking here.These electors have a responsibility to keep our country from burning down to the ground. Trump has already proven that he isn t taking the presidency seriously and that he intends put our government into the hands of people who want to destroy it.Lessig is right to ask the electors to switch their votes to Clinton and the rest of us need to ask them to do it, too. We need to support them and tell them we have their back. Sure, conservatives will bitch about it. But at this point, who really gives a shit about them anyway? They voted for a tyrant, therefore, their opinions no longer matter.Featured Image: Zach Gibson/Getty Images",Fake

Currently at the Export-Import Bank, Scaramucci is expected to start his new job in August, the official said. No other changes were immediately expected in a communications operation that includes press secretary Sean Spicer and his deputy, Sarah Sanders, the official said.

" Latest Polls Show Hillary Could Win One Of The MOST Important Deep Red States GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump has been steadily ripping the Republican Party apart at the seams due to the embarrassing travesty of a campaign he s been running. This is especially true since the surfacing of a tape of Trump and former Access Hollywood host Billy Bush having what is quite possibly the most lewd, offensive conversation two men could have about women. As if that weren t enough, nearly a dozen women have come forward claiming Trump did to them just what he bragged about being able to do on that tape.Trump s scandals are literally doing something that no one thought possible: Turning certain reliably red states into battleground states. According to the polling organization RealClearPolitics, Trump s lack of acceptability could actually turn TEXAS, of all places, blue. As of Sunday, Trump is within the margin of error   just three points ahead of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. The average of all of the available polling is a 4.8 point divide. This is likely due to the fact that there are some things that are just not partisan   open misogyny, narcissism, racism, xenophobia, and all of the other characteristics that make for huge deal-breakers on the basis of basic decency, regardless of political leanings.Other red states that could be within striking distance for Hillary include Arizona, Utah and Georgia. This would be why Trump, who is simply unable to accept losing at anything, is now talking of a  rigged election.  It s an effort to make his already angry, disillusioned supporters become even more aggrieved. This makes for a dangerous situation, and therefore it is DEFINITELY a good thing if Hillary can not only win, but run up the score around the nation and completely annihilate Trump.Featured image via Justin Sullivan via Getty Images",Fake

Vice-Mayor Wes Bellamy stated that his community has come together in solidarity to fight against the white supremacists and neo-Nazis who were responsible for riots that resulted in the death of a counter-protester. And while Trump has continued to pretend he has no connection or responsibility for the riots, Bellamy directly called him out and held him accountable.In the interview, Bellamy stated that if white supremacists under the guidance of their president, number 45  returned to Charlottesville, the community wouldn t hesitate to drive them back out. He said: They can continue to come, but our community will not break. The people here of Charlottesville, white people, black people, yellow people, old people, young people, we re a community that rallies around together. This is a community that I saw pick me up on my darkest and deepest moments to encourage me   and they ve done the same for other people. We re a resilient group. Bellamy then spoke directly to Trump, pointing out that he has the responsibility to condemn white supremacists, which he still has not yet done. Bellamy said: So 45, we re looking for your leadership. Condemn that white supremacist attacks. Condemn these domestic terrorists. Tell them to leave. You re their leader. Stand up.

"Wray confirmed by Senate to lead FBI after Comey firing WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Tuesday confirmed former Justice Department lawyer Christopher Wray as FBI chief, nearly three months after the agencyâ€™s previous director, James Comey, was fired by President Donald Trump. Wray, who was confirmed by vote of 92-5, will take charge of the countryâ€™s top domestic law enforcement agency during a federal probe into allegations of collusion between the Trump presidential campaign and Russia. Since the dismissal of Comey on May 9, the Justice Department has appointed Robert Mueller as special counsel to oversee the investigation with the help of the FBI. Russia denies any interference, and Trump has denied collusion with Russia. Wray vowed in his confirmation hearing last month to remain independent and not be swayed by politics or pressure from the president. He also praised Muller as the â€œconsummate straight shooter.â€ He also worked with Comey on the governmentâ€™s case in the Enron Corp fraud scandal in the early 2000s.  During the confirmation hearing, Republican Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley said Wrayâ€™s background showed he was committed to independence, an attribute he said was â€œvitally importantâ€ in the next FBI director.  Wray served as assistant attorney general in charge of the criminal division at the Justice Department under former Republican President George W. Bush.  Former Attorney General Eric Holder and former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, both Democrats who served under President Barack Obama, endorsed Wray.   ",Real

"McCain introduces bill to kill Puerto Rico shipping restrictions WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican senators John McCain and Mike Lee introduced a bill on Thursday to permanently waive shipping restrictions on Puerto Rico, saying a temporary waiver from the Trump administration is â€œinsufficientâ€ to help the island rebuild from Hurricane Maria. President Donald Trumpâ€™s administration earlier on Thursday waived the restriction known as the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, or the Jones Act, for Puerto Rico for 10 days, after a request by Puerto Ricoâ€™s governor, Ricardo Rossello. Opponents of the Jones Act, which bars foreign vessels from shipping goods between U.S. coasts, say it hurts consumers on U.S. islands, including Puerto Rico and Hawaii, by adding shipping costs to imports of basic goods like food and fuel.  McCain called the Jones Act an â€œantiquated, protectionist law that has driven up costs and crippled Puerto Ricoâ€™s economy.â€  In 2013, a Federal Reserve Bank of New York report said the Jones Act hurts Puerto Ricoâ€™s economy. It estimated that shipping costs from the U.S. East Coast to Puerto Rico are double what they are to the nearby Dominican Republic, thanks mainly to the Jones Act.   In addition, the U.S. Virgin Islands have been exempt from the Jones Act for decades, which opponents of the law say is unfair to Puerto Rico.  It was unclear whether McCain could gain widespread support for the bill that would waive the law, which is supported by shipping and security interests.   Not only do U.S. ship builders support the Jones Act, but also a wide array of industries that build parts that go into ships, businesses that are spread throughout the country.  President Donald Trump, before his administration waived the law temporarily, pointed out that â€œa lot of shippers and ... a lot of people that work in the shipping industryâ€ did not want the restrictions waived for Puerto Rico. In 1998, McCain sponsored legislation to allow waivers of the law, a measure that created exemptions that are in place today. In 2010, 2015 and this past July he introduced legislation to fully repeal the restrictions.  ",Real

Thereâ€™s no other way to say it. I got into a topic that I shouldnâ€™t have and I screwed up,â€ Spicer said during an event at a museum in Washington. â€œOn both a personal level and a professional level that will definitely go down as not a very good day in my history,â€ he added. Spicer triggered an uproar at a White House briefing on Tuesday while discussing chemical weapons use by the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, saying that even Hitler did not use chemical weapons during World War Two. The comments drew sharp criticism on social media and elsewhere for overlooking the fact that the Nazis killed  millions of Jews and others in gas chambers. Eighty-seven people, including children, were killed in last weekâ€™s chemical weapons attack in Syria.  Offered a chance to clarify his remarks during Tuesdayâ€™s briefing, Spicer attempted to draw a distinction between the two different uses of deadly chemicals. Later on Tuesday, he apologized for his handling of the topic, which came on the Jewish holiday of Passover and as Christians prepare to celebrate Easter. On Wednesday, Spicer said the comments were â€œinexcusable and reprehensibleâ€ and all the more painful because they were made at a time sacred to Jews and Christians. He said it also was disappointing from a professional standpoint, especially after what he said were â€œan unbelievable couple of weeksâ€ of Trumpâ€™s presidency. He noted that Trump had bombed a Syrian air base in a forceful response to chemical weapons use by Assadâ€™s government and said Trumpâ€™s hosting of Chinese President Xi Jinping last week had produced â€œtremendous progress.â€ â€œYour job as the spokesperson is to help amplify the presidentâ€™s actions and accomplishments,â€ Spicer said. â€œAnd when youâ€™re distracting from that message of accomplishment ... itâ€™s disappointing because I think Iâ€™ve let the president down.â€ ",Real
" WATCH: Giuliani Demands That Democrats Apologize For Trumpâ€™s Racist Birtherism You know, because in fantasyland Republicans never questioned the citizenship of America s first black president.But that s exactly what they did for years and Donald Trump led the charge by going on or calling into Fox News every chance he could in order to demand President Obama s birth certificate.It was Trump who constantly claimed President Obama was born in Kenya even though Hawaii newspapers from the time announce Obama s birth.Trump and his birther fans were finally utterly humiliated when President Obama released his birth certificate to the public.And now that birtherism is coming back to bite Trump on the ass as he tries to convince black voters that he isn t a racist.Part of the reason why black voters reject Trump is because he questioned the citizenship of President Obama simply because he is black. But Trump wants everyone to pretend he didn t say any nasty things about President Obama and Trump pawn Rudy Giuliani is demanding that Democrats apologize for Trump s birtherism.Giuliani, who has taken to forgetting about 9/11 recently, appeared on CNN with Jake Tapper on Sunday and was grilled because Trump has not apologized for his birtherism. Many African-Americans say they are still troubled by Mr. Trump having suggested over and over, falsely, that the first African-American president was born in Africa and thus ineligible to be president  Tapper began.Giuliani immediately blamed Hillary Clinton for starting the birther conspiracy, but Tapper quickly fact-checked Giuliani, which forced him to blame Clinton s campaign instead.Giuliani then attempted to portray Trump as a hero for  resolving  the conspiracy, claiming that black people  have a faulty memory. He literally thinks black people should thank Trump for being a birther.But Tapper was quick to remind Giuliani that it was President Obama who resolved the conspiracy by releasing his birth certificate in 2011 while Trump was still pushing his birtherism four years later in February 2015 when he told CPAC that he thinks the birth certificate is fake. So apparently Trump thinks it hasn t been resolved, thus blowing Giuliani s claim out of the water. Should he just apologize for this if he really wants to reach out to minority voters?  Tapper asked.Giuliani replied by demanding that Democrats apologize for calling Trump s birtherism racist and went on to bash President Obama. If everybody apologized for all the things they said in politics, all we would be doing on television shows is apologizing. Maybe all the Democrats should apologize for calling Donald Trump a racist and calling him all kinds of terrible names and it gets a little silly. Food stamps have gone up two and a half times under Barack Obama,  he added.  He should be ashamed of himself. Jobs should have gone up two and a half times. My only point is that many African-Americans are still mad about Donald Trump having tried to invalidate Barack Obama by claiming he was born in Africa,  Tapper responded before giving up and moving on.Here s the video via YouTube:Giuliani seems to be forgetting that the recession that began under George W. Bush and the Republicans in 2008 caused more families to need food stamps in the first place, which is why the number of people on food stamps has gone up. Also, President Obama has set a record for the most consecutive months of jobs created and is actually one of the best job-creating presidents over the last 40 years.Once again, Giuliani gets caught talking out of his ass and he must be truly desperate if he is resorting to demanding an apology from Democrats for Trump s racism.Featured Image: Screenshot",Fake

It did not go well. The meeting went off the rails because, the senators found, Trump doesn t know a damn thing about the bill.According to the New York Times,A senator who supports the bill left the meeting at the White House with a sense that the president did not have a grasp of some basic elements of the Senate plan   and seemed especially confused when a moderate Republican complained that opponents of the bill would cast it as a massive tax break for the wealthy.Again, the Times spoke to a person who was actually at the meeting.But Trump whined about the report anyway and complained that the Times did not call him to confirm the story, which we all know he would not have done because Trump thinks any news story about his incompetence is  fake news.

The Onion ran a story with the following headline:  Moderator Reminds Vice Presidential Debate Audience To Remain Silent When Exiting Early.  It was already assumed that this debate wouldn t have nearly the spirit of the presidential debates, but The Onion took it nine steps further with this  quote  from the moderator, Elaine Quijano: It s crucial that you stay in a single-file line and make sure to keep moving in an orderly fashion so the aisles are clear for others attempting to leave their seats. And please abstain from slamming the door so as not to disturb those audience members who are sleeping.  [emphasis mine] The Daily Show s  live feed included a picture of a glass of milk with a tie, and some toast with a tie:The allusion is to milquetoast, which refers to a 1920s comic book character, Caspar Milquetoast, who was timid, and now is a general reference to people who are meek or timid. Accompanying that image was audio from the actual debate. It s also an illustration that the VP candidates do seem to remain in the background of each campaign.The general expectation was a very boring debate and both of these demonstrate that expectation very well.

In the video, Olbermann shows several tweets and comments from Trump about people being  fired like a dog,  or  kicked out of the ABC news debate  like a dog,'  or  begging for money  like a dog.'  Mitt Romney  choked like a dog,  according to Trump. Clearly, dogs don t get fired from jobs. They don t beg for money (although it s not above them to beg for treats).For Olbermann, the most ridiculous  like a dog  comment to come from Trump was when he accused Marco Rubio of  sweating like a dog.  Anyone who knows anything at all about dogs, knows that dogs don t sweat. They do pant, though, and that can make them very thirsty, so I suppose there is a Rubio comparison to dogs, just not that one. People who don t have dogs still know about dogs,  Olbermann said.  What the hell? Is he from Mars? The far, far bigger issue, though, has nothing to do with tweets or silly rhetoric. It has everything to do with how he ll do and what he ll do as President of the United States. Trump, like pretty much all Republicans, sees regulations as obstacles to his getting even wealthier than he is.In a press release that has since been pulled off the internet, Trump complained about the  FDA Food Police,  and complained that the federal government  expects farmers to produce fruits and vegetables and even dictates the nutritional content of dog food.  (emphasis added).As Olbermann pointed out, in the last year, 11 of the 23 pet food recalls from the FDA have been because dog food manufacturers were poisoning dogs. That s when Olbermann, visibly angry, said that Trump has hinted that as a president,  he would protect a business man s right to poison dogs. Here s the video:Could you really trust a POTUS who has never had a dog? And, y know, wants to protect businesses who poison them? pic.twitter.com/NykVqnG6Nj  Keith Olbermann (@KeithOlbermann) October 3, 2016Upwards of half of all Americans own pets. Beyond that, cruelty to animals is a major indicator of other psychological problems, including psychopathy. In other words, you don t have to be a dog owner to see that Trump s attitude toward dogs sets a dangerous precedent for how he d run the country.Featured image of Donald Trump via Spencer Platt/Getty Images | Featured image of dog via Noel Vasquez/Getty Images.",Fake
" Trump Is FUMING Over Bad Charlottesville Press, Becomes A Terror In The White House (TWEET) Once again, Donald Trump is having a completely disappointing, inappropriate reaction to the racially motivated violence that happened in Charlottesville, Virginia last weekend.Apparently, instead of being outraged about the murder of one counter protester and the injuries of several others, Trump is all bent out of shape because he has gotten a lot of negative press coverage for his weak, pathetic response to the incident. According to White House officials, Trump is coming apart at the seams over this, as Robert Costa reported: Person close to Kelly framed it to me this way: POTUS fuming at press, coverage of C ville handling. In no mood for talk about moderation. Seriously, what did Trump expect to happen after he ignored America s pleas to denounce the violence for two whole days, before issuing a scripted, half-ass statement on Monday? Not even the white supremacists Trump targeted in his response believed that he was actually denouncing racism.If Trump wanted positive press coverage, he should have actually done his job and condemned the white supremacist values and bigotry from the start. Speaking up against racism and the violence that broke out of that white nationalist rally was possibly the easiest task a President could ask for, and Trump failed miserably at executing that. Instead, Trump protected and defended the racist attackers, making his approval rating only plummet further and giving the media even more things to criticize.Trump can blame the media all he wants, but it is his own lack of competency that is responsible for his failure as president. He never does the right thing, even when it is blatantly obvious what actions he should be taking. What happened in Charlottesville was an opportunity for Trump to emerge as a different president than most Americans expect him to be, and he completely blew it. There is something very wrong when a leader cares more about his press coverage than the lives of his constituents.Featured image via Branden Camp  / Getty Images",Fake
" Racist White Football Player Goes Free After Raping Black Disabled Teen With Coat Hanger (VIDEO) A white Idaho teen was facing life in prison for a horrific sexual attack on a black teammate with mental disabilities that makes the  butter rape  scene in  Last Tango in Paris  seem downright tame.On October 23, 2015, 17-year-old John R.K. Howard and two teammates, Tanner Ward and an unnamed 16-year-old student, pretended to give their African-American teammate a hug, then held him down and raped him with a coat hanger in the locker room. According to a lawsuit filed by the victim s mother, this is the culmination of months of race-based harassment. KTVB reports:According to prosecutors, the sexual assault happened Oct. 23, 2015 in the high school locker room. The lawsuit describes one teammate pretending to offer the victim a hug, then holding him down as another boy inserted a coat hanger into his rectum. A third attacker then kicked the coat hanger several times, forcing it farther into the victim s body and causing rectal injuries that required treatment at a hospital, lawyers say. The Plaintiff screamed and cried out but no staff member came to his assistance or even attempted to investigate the clamor from within the locker room,  attorneys R. Keith Roark and E. Lee Schlender wrote in the filing.The attorney general s office filed charges against three students in March after a months-long investigation. John R. K. Howard and Tanner Ward are both charged as adults with forcible sexual penetration, and could face up to life in prison if convicted. The third student is charged as a juvenile.According to the lawsuit, the victim was regularly called  Kool-Aid,   chicken-eater,   watermelon,  and the classic  n*gger  by teammates for the better part of the year leading up to the attack. Several teammates would regularly jump on the victim s back and  hump  him during practice and he was forced to endure painful wedgies. Howard personally posted a Confederate flag on the victim s Facebook profile and demanded he learn and recite the song,  Moonman Notorious KKK,  which makes a reference to lynching.  They even drew this adorable little picture of him sitting in the back of a bus:On Friday, Howard   whom the lawsuit notes   is a relative of prominent individuals in the community    managed to escape jail time and even registering as a sex offender by pleading guilty to a lesser crime. We don t believe it s appropriate for Mr. Howard to suffer the consequences of a sex offender,  Deputy Attorney General Casey Hemmer said of the attack, noting that he doesn t feel the  egregious  attack was a sex crime no matter how much coat hanger rape was involved.  But he still needs to be held accountable. After completing 300 hours of community service, Howard will likely be able to have his conviction dismissed and he will be allowed to maintain his innocence despite the evidence against him. In other words, not only does he manage to avoid any form of actual punishment, but he can now torment his victim by telling everyone that he is innocent of the crime and nothing can be done about it. Now that s accountability right there!Watch a report on the attack below:Featured image via screengrab",Fake
" The White House Released Trumpâ€™s Border Wall Requirements, And They Are Comedy GOLD Trump just will not stop hammering his border wall as the solution to every problem we ve ever had. In addition to the U.S. government sending  notices of taking  to Texans living along the U.S.-Mexico border, the White House has now released its requirements for the wall. Fox News posted the list to Twitter, and it s just ridiculous.Border wall requirements. pic.twitter.com/AFYG0s5pCS  Fox News (@FoxNews) March 19, 2017At first it looks like this could be a joke, until you see the blue checkmark next to Fox News  Twitter name. These three requirements are hilarious because they re so vague they say absolutely nothing. It s like Fox called Trump up out of the blue, said,  What are the requirements for the border wall,  and Trump replied with,  Oh. Um. Yes. The wall. Yes. Um. Requirements Nothing about a better pricing estimate, what materials they think they need where, how they plan to keep it from interrupting migration patterns or diverting floodwaters, or anything that might actually tell us what the true requirements for this wall are. Just three vague things that demonstrate the Trump administration is more about touting the wall than they are about actually planning for it.The last two are especially odd.  Look good from U.S. side.  It must also look  imposing  from the Mexican side. Aside from the fact that this looks like a toddler wrote it, we do know that nobody wants an eyesore in their backyard.But a 30-ft wall may well be an eyesore anyway no matter how  tasteful  they try and make it look. For instance, those living along the Rio Grande, where their view is of a river and they re closely intertwined with sister cities in Mexico, are likely to suffer both from the eyesore that is a giant wall. Are they going to build it out of Plexiglas to avoid interrupting views? No. It has to look  imposing  from the far side.In reality, some communities might benefit from rising property values, while others would suffer grievously when their local economies crash as people from their sister cities can t come across to shop anymore. The way it looks won t help the communities that are going to suffer regardless. Difficult to climb or cut through.  Well duh. Really? They ve been saying the entire time that the whole point of having a wall is to keep people from being able to climb over it or cut through it like they can in places along the existing fence. But people will still climb it, people will still tunnel under it, and some might find ways around them via the oceans.When you consider the fact that most undocumented immigrants entered the U.S. legally on a visitor visa, and then just never left, it makes  difficult to climb or cut through  seem even more absurd. It would be nice to know what the administration believes this wall will truly require in terms of, well, everything, since we re the ones who are going to pay for it. But it would be even nicer if they d drop it altogether, since our tax dollars are going towards a massive waste of time, money and resources.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images ",Fake
" Trump: I Donâ€™t Meet With The Press Because They Mangle My â€˜Beautiful Flowing Sentencesâ€™ Donald Trump once bragged that he had  the best words  but researchers found that his speeches were at an average of about a 7th-grade reading level. Trump generally scored the lowest of all of his rivals. But, Trump being Trump, he s doing it again and bragging about his  beautiful flowing sentences. This week, Trump canceled a much-anticipated press conference on his private business dealings, saying he was too busy nominating Cabinet members, but he was seen meeting with Kanye West. Trump promised to address his conflicts of interest but we suppose meeting with a rapper is more of a priority for the president-elect. Trump has not held a press conference since July 27th even though he blasted Hillary Clinton for not meeting with the press during the campaign.Vox reports that Trump now has a different excuse for not meeting with the press for interviews:The press mangles his  beautiful  sentences, and he has had enough of it, Trump told a crowd in West Allis, Wisconsin, at one of his Victory Tour rallies.Trump literally said that.  For the last month I decided not to do interviews, because they give interviews and they chop up your sentences and cut them short,  he said.  You will have this beautiful flowing sentence where the back of the sentence reverts to the front and they cut the back of the sentence off, and I say I never said that. So, I said, you know what, I am not going to deal with them. They are very dishonest people, I said. Vox had linguists weigh in on Trump s speeches. His speeches are full of non sequiturs,  says Kristin Kobes Du Mez, a Calvin College historian who has done a comparative study of Trump and Clinton s speaking styles. It s a completely different style from nearly any other politician you normally see on a big stage.What s even more peculiar about his remark is that after each incendiary statement he made during his campaign, it was as if his defenders felt the need to step in to say what he really meant. In March, the New York Post said that Trump speaks at a fourth-grade level and suggested he might do that intentionally. We wonder what speaking level Trump is in Russian.Photo by Scott Olson via Getty.",Fake
" NAACP: Bannon May Be Gone But Trump Is Still A Raging Bigot The NAACP issued a statement following the firing of Steve Bannon, Donald Trump s racist chief strategist, on Friday afternoon. The organization explained that while they are certainly glad to see Bannon go, it doesn t change the fact that the sitting president is still a raging bigot. The NAACP is glad to see Steve Bannon out of the White House,  Derrick Johnson, the group s interim president and CEO said in a statement. Ousting one key staffer, however, can t erase the words used by President Trump this week in defense of domestic terrorists, neo-Nazis and white supremacists. President Trump provided permission for these hate groups to exist. Bannon left his job at the right-wing propoganda site, Breitbart News, to sign on as Trump s campaign manager and then became the alleged president s chief strategist following the election. As a well known racist and anti-Semite, Bannon was widely accepted as the bigoted mastermind behind much of Trump s most racist rhetoric and policies.In the statement, the NAACP also called on Trump to fire the rest of  the people who share Steve Bannon s poisonous beliefs, including senior policy adviser Stephen Miller and national security aide Sebastian Gorka.Bannon s firing came after racial tensions in the U.S. reached a fevered pitch following the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia that left a counter-protester dead. Trump has repeatedly failed to convincingly denounce these hate groups. Instead, he has chosen to argue that  both sides  were responsible for the violence and accused counter-protesters of violently attacking the poor innocent Nazis, which has lead to widespread outrage.The NAACP is absolutely right. Bannon was just one of many racists in Trump s White House and his departure surely doesn t fix the overall problem, which is that Trump himself holds these same bigoted beliefs.Featured image via Zach Gibson   Pool/Getty Images",Fake
" FASCISM: Republicans Publish List Of â€˜Anti-Americanâ€™ Professors, Declare War On Higher Education Conservatives have set up a fascist  professor watchlist  website in order to target professors they feel aren t conservative enough. As professors are teachers, and reality has a liberal bias, it s likely to get pretty extensive.The project, by Turning Point USA, was set up by 22-year-old conservative wonderboy Charlie Kirk, a young man who is clearly frustrated by the lack of reception among his peers for his fascist and anti-American ideals. The  about us  section on their website reads,  The mission of Professor Watchlist is to expose and document college professors who discriminate against conservative students and advance leftist propaganda in the classroom. Help us identify, and expose more professors who have demonstrated liberal bias in the classroom. Donate today! It s interesting that a group whose favorite slogan is  big government sucks!  doesn t understand how supporting the new administration s war on speech is the most intrusive government ever gets. It s important to remember that when a Republican says something bad about  big government,  they almost always want to replace it with a rich guy or corporation making the same decisions for you. They don t care about the public good, only private profit.It s notable that, as a 501(c)3, the purpose of the group should be religious, educational, literary, charitable, or scientific in nature. There are a couple of other qualifications as well, but the important thing to take away here is that an organization concentrated on smearing individuals for speech they believe is political in nature probably doesn t qualify, and any good citizen should file a complaint with the IRS. They re abusing the tax code to avoid revealing donors. If they endorse a candidate or could be construed as campaigning, their tax-exempt status will go out the window. This is only a step away. The rest of Turning Point s activities are not any more charitable or less political.Politics isn t enough for Republicans. They can t win the vote or argue policy   they have to gerrymander districts and cheat to win. They can t keep religion in the churches   they need everyone to believe the same way they do. They can t stomach free speech   they have to make war on the press, try to silence opposition, and shut down debate on college campuses.BBC reports:Nearly 150 professors are listed on the website. The list is searchable by school or name and includes pictures of the university teachers and descriptions of their alleged transgressions, backed up by links to conservative news sites. Almost all the instances on the website are people who not only oppose what we believe in but are very biased against it and don t present the other side,  says Matt Lamb, director of constitutional enforcement and transparency at Turning Point. We just want students, parents, alumni to know what s going on. So if an alumni is thinking of donating to a school they may want to know where their money is going, if they believe or agree or disagree with the professor s views. So far, it looks like students and professors are fighting back. Names like Jesus and Indiana Jones have been added, with appropriate descriptions of their liberal propaganda and agenda, and the hashtag #trollprofwatchlist trended a few days ago with people posting their troll submissions to the website. The more that are added, the more confusing and difficult the job of identifying disagreeing professors will be for the fascists.However, while silliness and trolling may temporarily undermine the usefulness of the site, the underlying danger presented cannot be ignored or denied. This is an age where Republicans have their own media, their own version of the world, and in many ways, their own truth (objectivity be damned!). This is an age where  fake news  lists are passed around based on a partisan slant (those of us on the left generally understand when something is fact or opinion   the other side, not so much). This is an age where lists of professors that have ideological disagreements with the authoritarian right wing get their names published online.With Trump s rhetoric, this becomes especially problematic. There is the potential that such a list could be used not only to deny alumni donations from a school, but actually used by the more rabid of Fuhrer Trump s followers to target these men and women. Conservatives believe this is a culture war, and they ll do anything to win.Featured image via screen capture",Fake

"Companies have up to a year for new U.S. tax bill reporting: SEC WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. financial regulators said on Friday that because the new tax bill could make timely financial reporting difficult, public companies can make reasonable estimates when uncertain of the impact of the new tax law in financial reports, and will have up to a year to report final numbers.               The Securities and Exchange Commission bulletin comes after the U.S. Chamber of Commerce warned on Thursday that some U.S. listed companies may struggle to file their annual financial reports on time because the Republican-led overhaul of the countryâ€™s tax system may prompt a raft of additional disclosures. In a statement on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TJCA) issued on Friday, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton and Commissioners Kara Stein and Michael Piwowar said guidance was similar to that given in the past when tax law changes affected financial reporting. The $1.5 trillion tax bill, signed into law on Friday by U.S. President Donald Trump, will significantly affect many companiesâ€™ year-end financial statements because listing rules oblige them to flag any potential material risks or changes to their operations and financial outlook to shareholders. The bill significantly lowers the income tax rate for U.S. companies - to 21 percent from 35 percent - allows them to repatriate cash from overseas, and modifies numerous deductions, among other changes.  Public companies have been given a â€œmeasurement periodâ€ to study the changes created by a new law. During the measurement period, the SEC expects companies to complete their accounting and that â€œin no circumstances should the measurement period extend beyond one year from the enactment date,â€ of the TJCA. Companies will also need to make disclosures during the measurement period, including any updates to provisional amounts given earlier, or newly discovered reporting implications from tax bill. For companies with fiscal years ending Dec. 31, getting the necessary analysis done in time could be tough, the Chamber said. The tax bill It is the largest such overhaul since the 1980. In addition to slashing the corporate rate, it temporarily reduces the tax burden for most individuals.     ",Real
"Development aid cannot be part of defense spending: NATO's Stoltenberg BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A countryâ€™s spending on development aid and on defense are separate items, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Friday, responding to German comments about NATOâ€™s target for increasing military budgets. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel had said on Thursday that it was not realistic for Germany to spend 2 percent of its economic output on defense and that other spending, such as development aid, should be taken into consideration. â€œDiplomacy, development aid, economic cooperation can be important to help stabilize a region,â€ Stoltenberg told a news conference in Brussels. â€œWe have international targets, guidelines, for development aid, 0.7 percent of GDP and then we have a NATO agreement on moving toward 2 percent. But those are two different things, even though both are important,â€ he added. â€œIt is not either development or security, it is development and security and the foundation of development is to have peace and security.â€ ",Real
"Trump urges India's Modi to fix deficit, but stresses strong ties WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump urged Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to do more to relax Indian trade barriers on Monday during talks in which both leaders took great pains to stress the importance of a strong U.S.-Indian relationship. At a closely watched first meeting between the two, Trump and Modi appeared to get along well. Modi pulled in Trump for a bear hug on the stage as the cameras rolled in the Rose Garden. â€œI deeply appreciate your strong commitment to the enhancement of our bilateral relations,â€ Modi told him. â€œI am sure that under your leadership a mutually beneficial strategic partnership will gain new strength, new positivity, and will reach new heights.â€ Trump was also warm but made clear he sees a need for more balance in the U.S.-India trade relationship in keeping with his campaign promise to expand American exports and create more jobs at home. Last year the U.S. trade deficit with India neared $31 billion. Trump said he would like a trading relationship that is â€œfair and reciprocal.â€  â€œIt is important that barriers be removed to the export of U.S. goods into your markets and that we reduce our trade deficit with your country,â€ he said. Trump said he was pleased about an Indian airlineâ€™s recent order of 100 new American planes and that the United States looked forward to exporting more energy, including major long-term contracts to purchase American natural gas. These energy contracts â€œare being negotiated and we will sign â€“ trying to get the price up a little bit,â€ Trump said. Modi came to Washington looking to revitalize a relationship that thrived under former President Barack Obama but has appeared to flag as Trump courted Indiaâ€™s rival China in an effort to persuade Beijing to do more to rein in North Korea. Modi effusively praised Trump, hailing his â€œvast and successful experience in the business worldâ€ and â€œgreat leadershipâ€ for U.S.-India ties, which he said should â€œlend an aggressive and forward looking agenda to our relations.â€ Trump accepted Modiâ€™s invitation to visit India, the White House said in a statement, but no time frame was given for the trip. Modi harked back to Trumpâ€™s â€œMake America Great Againâ€ campaign slogan to stress that his agenda for his country was little different than Trumpâ€™s. â€œI am sure that the convergence of my vision for â€œNew Indiaâ€ and President Trumpâ€™s vision for making America great again will add new dimensions to our cooperation,â€ he said. Trump did not mention U.S. differences with India on immigration and the Paris climate accord. â€œThe future of our partnership has never looked brighter,â€ Trump said as both leaders underscored the importance of the defense and security relationship. As they met, a Pentagon agency said the U.S. State Department has approved the possible sale to India of a Boeing C-17 transport aircraft with an estimated cost of $366 million. The United States also has offered to sell a naval variant of the Predator drone made by U.S. defense contractor General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, the White House said in a statement, a deal that would be worth more than $2 billion. The United States has become the leading supplier of defense equipment to India, signing contracts worth more than $15 billion since 2008. On Monday evening, Trump and Modi had a working dinner, the first time Trump has played host to a foreign dignitary at a White House dinner. Trump administration officials have pointed to both leadersâ€™ impact on social media - each has more than 30 million Twitter followers - as proof they are cut from the same cloth. â€œIf the chemistry is good, everything else gets sorted,â€ said an Indian official. â€œThe only way is up. How much up we go depends on the leaders. If they click, we go up higher.â€ Trade, however, remains an irritant, and on Saturday, leading U.S. congressmen complained in a letter to Trump that high-level engagement had failed to eliminate major barriers to U.S. imports and investment and had not deterred India from imposing new ones. Indian officials reject suggestions that Modiâ€™s â€œMake in Indiaâ€ platform is protectionist and complain about the U.S. regulatory process for generic pharmaceuticals and rules on fruit imports. They stress the future importance of the huge Indian market to U.S. firms and major growth in areas such as aviation which will offer significant opportunities for U.S. manufacturers. Among the Indian business executives in Washington for Modiâ€™s visit was Ajay Singh, chairman of Indian budget airline SpiceJet, which in January announced a deal to buy up to 205 aircraft from Boeing, worth up to $22 billion at list prices. Singh told Reuters that according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, the deal would sustain up to 132,000 jobs. â€œThe market is growing 20-25 percent a year. Even at todayâ€™s pace you need 100 more planes a year just to keep pace with the market and we are not getting anywhere close to that number.â€ â€œAs our economy grows ... we can potentially create a lot of jobs for Americans in the United States,â€ he said. Boeing has estimated India will need 1,850 new aircraft worth $265 billion by 2036 to meet demand for air travel. ",Real
" Hey Trump Fans: Trump Hasnâ€™t Improved The Economy One Single Bit, And Hereâ€™s Proof Trump hasn t made the economy better, no matter what he and his sheeple claim. In discussing jobs on Trump s TV network, Trump lackey Kayleigh McEnany acted as though Trump s 1 million jobs mark is some kind of record, when in fact, he lags behind Obama s final six months, and a bunch of other six-month periods during the Obama era.Obama s economy added 1.08 million jobs in his final six months. Trump s economy has added 1.07 million in his first six months. That s an average of 181,000 per month for Obama vs. 179,000 per month for Trump. This graph shows no evidence of a  Trump bump: Image via the Washington PostTrump is having fun pretending he s the best president ever, though, while he hasn t managed to get any major economic policies through Congress and signed into law. No infrastructure packages, no tax reform, no new or better trade deals, nothing. All he s done is use executive orders to eliminate some regulations. That s not enough to cause the economic surge he and his lackeys keep insisting is happening. He is so not  making America great again  in terms of jobs. We are currently feeling the continuing effects of the Obama economy.Trump has focused on the manufacturing and mining industries to the detriment of others, such as agriculture. When he pulled us out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, manufacturers cheered, while agriculture sat and stared in horror. We re responsible for an awful lot of agricultural exports to Asia, and with TPP gone, the rest of the world is stepping in to fill the void with lower tariffs and other incentives.Our agricultural industry lost a potential $10 billion bump in productivity because of Trump, and we lost competitive advantages over Europe and Australia. A four-country bloc here in the Americas Mexico, Peru, Chile and Colombia is becoming the trade leader here and is working on deals with New Zealand, Singapore and Australia, because fuck us.They have no reason not to with Trump at the helm here. Trump has zero understanding of the economy and doesn t seem to know or care that his job numbers could very easily be a sign of a slowing economy, not one gaining speed. Nor does he seem to know or care that Obama actually did much better during his second term. From February 2016 to July 2016, our economy added 1.24 million jobs. For that same period in 2015, we added 1.37 million jobs, and for those same six months in 2014, we added 1.51 million jobs.During that period in 2013, we added 1.17 million jobs. That was the first full six months of Obama s second term.And Trump has only managed to add 1.07, which, as shown above, is lower than Obama s 1.08 for his final six months. So Trump inherited a possibly slowing economy, which has only slowed more under his and the Republicans  leadership (if, indeed, it can even be called that). For the five hundred millionth time, Trump sheeple, Trump has not turned the economy around. Not even close.Read more:Featured image via Zach Gibson   Pool/Getty Images",Fake
" BOMBSHELL: Melania Trump Refuses To Believe Access Hollywood Tapes In BIZARRE Interview (VIDEO) With the release of the 2005 Access Hollywood tape revealing Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump saying lewd remarks that revealed him to be a sexual predator, there hasn t been anyone capable of defending him.However, now, in an interview with Anderson Cooper on CNN, Melania Trump is coming to her husband s defense and seemingly blaming Billy Bush, the other man on the Access Hollywood tape.According to Melania, Bush  egged  Trump on. Although, if you listen to the tapes it was clearly the other way around.Melania told Cooper: I said to my husband that, you know, the language was inappropriate. It s not acceptable. And I was surprised, because that is not the man that I know. She also said, now making excuses for his horrific behavior: And as you can see from the tape, the cameras were not on   it was only a mic. And I wonder if they even knew that the mic was on. Then when asked if she s ever heard her husband speak like that, she said: No. No, that s why I was surprised, because I said like I don t know that person that would talk that way, and that he would say that kind of stuff in private. Melania seems to either be in complete denial that her husband does, in fact, speak that way, or she s been instructed by her husband and his campaign to shift blame to Billy Bush and away from Donald.

"Trump attends civil rights museum opening; black leaders stay away JACKSON, Miss. (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump flew to Mississippi on Saturday to attend the opening of a civil rights museum, but his visit was marred by the absence of top African-American leaders who stayed away in protest of his policies and record on race relations. Trump toured the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum and delivered brief remarks, paying tribute to African-Americans who fought institutionalized racism, including Medgar Evers, the civil rights activist who was murdered outside his home in Jackson in 1963. â€œWe want our country to be a place where every child from every background can grow up free from fear, innocent of hatred and surrounded by love, opportunity and hope,â€ Trump said in prepared remarks. Referring to Evers and other civil rights leaders showcased in the museum, Trump said: â€œToday we strive to be worthy of their sacrifice. We pray for inspiration from their example.â€ Trump acknowledged Eversâ€™ wife Myrlie and brother Charles in the audience. U.S. Representative John Lewis of Georgia, a Democrat who marched with Martin Luther King Jr. in the 1960s, said on Thursday that he would not go to the museum opening because of Trumpâ€™s presence. â€œPresident Trumpâ€™s attendance and his hurtful policies are an insult to the people portrayed in this civil rights museum,â€ Lewis said in a statement with Mississippi Democratic U.S. Representative Bennie Thompson, who also declined to attend. The two men also cited Trumpâ€™s â€œdisparaging comments about women, the disabled, immigrants and National Football League playersâ€ and said the president had shown disrespect to those who fought for civil rights in Mississippi. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People also took issue with Trumpâ€™s attendance. However, U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, who is black and ran against Trump in the early 2016 Republican presidential primaries before dropping out, accompanied the president on his tour of the museum. Trump, a Republican, has had a complicated record on race relations. He was a leading proponent of the false theory that Democratic President Barack Obama, the first black U.S. president, was not born in the United States. Obama was born in Hawaii, a U.S. state. In August, Trump unleashed a firestorm of criticism, including from Republicans and a top adviser in his administration, for saying that both left- and right-wing protesters were at fault for violence at a white supremacist-led rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, where one woman died. White House spokesman Raj Shah said on Friday ahead of the visit that the civil rights movement was about fighting intolerance, hatred and bigotry and that Trump intended to honor the leaders of that struggle. The White House called the decision by Lewis and Thompson not to attend â€œunfortunate.â€ Trump concluded his remarks by saying: â€œToday we pay solemn tribute to our heroes of the past and dedicate ourselves to building a future of freedom, equality justice and peace.â€ ",Real

"Kentucky clerk opposed to gay marriage to run for 2018 re-election LOUISVILLE, Ky. (Reuters) - The Kentucky county clerk who drew worldwide attention for her refusal to issue marriage licenses to gay couples two years ago will run for re-election next year, her attorney said on Tuesday. Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis will run to retain her seat in 2018 despite suggestions from some people that she run for a higher local or statewide political position, said Mat Staver, founder of Liberty Counsel.  Davis spent five days in jail in September 2015 after refusing a court order to issue marriage licenses following the Supreme Courtâ€™s decision legalizing same-sex marriage. Davis claimed same-sex marriage went against her Apostolic Christian beliefs. Staverâ€™s organization represented Davis in the resulting lawsuit filed by four couples against her. â€œSheâ€™s not interested in any other office,â€ Staver said. Last month, Davis and a representative of Liberty Counsel traveled to Romania, where those against same-sex marriage seek a referendum on the issue this fall, to meet with religious and political leaders, Staver said.     Davisâ€™ case in 2015 drew hundreds of protesters and supporters to her office in Morehead, in rural eastern Kentucky. While she was in jail, then-Republican presidential candidates Mike Huckabee and Ted Cruz visited her.  Less than a month after she was released from jail, Davis, who won election to the office in 2014 as a Democrat, changed her affiliation to the Republican Party.        Rowan County Democratic party officials could not be reached for comment. Prior to her election, Davis served as a deputy to her mother, Jean Bailey, who served as the county clerk for nearly four decades.     After her case, Kentucky lawmakers removed all county clerksâ€™ names from the state marriage license form. A federal judge later ruled that while the new law made the suits against her moot, the couplesâ€™ attorneys were still entitled to legal fees. The earliest Davis will be able to file for re-election is Wednesday, according to the Kentucky Secretary of Stateâ€™s office. ",Real
"Congress weighs Harvey aid package, awaits Trump WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers are expected to pass a large aid package for victims of Hurricane Harvey, but specifics of the plan and its price tag are unclear as Congress awaits a funding request from the Trump administration. Rain continued to pound Houston and the Gulf Coast on Monday as President Donald Trump said he expected rapid federal action to help fund a costly recovery. He plans to visit Texas on Tuesday to see storm-hit areas. â€œWeâ€™re dealing with Congress. As you know itâ€™s going to be a very expensive situation,â€ he told reporters in the White House. Historic flooding from Harvey, which came ashore in Texas last week as a powerful Category 4 hurricane and is now a tropical storm, has killed at least seven people in Texas and was expected to drive 30,000 from their homes. Wall Street analysts estimated insured losses of up to $20 billion, making Harvey one of the costliest storms in history for U.S. insurers. After past disasters, Congress approved billions of dollars in funds to help with relief and recovery, but in recent years, fiscal conservatives have raised questions about costs. Congress will return next week from summer vacation, with the hurricane complicating an already difficult fiscal situation with the federal budget and Trumpâ€™s Mexican border wall proposal. Current government funding runs out on Sept. 30. Congress must approve a measure to keep the government funded and prevent a shutdown. Trump threatened last week to shut down the government if Congress did not agree to $1.6 billion in funding to start building his proposed wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. Harvey â€œwill increase the pressure on Washington to not shut down the government, but it also makes the September 30 package more cumbersome and complicated,â€ Chris Krueger, policy analyst at financial firm Cowen & Co, said in a research note. Asked if Harvey made him reconsider his shutdown threat, Trump said: â€œIt has nothing to do with it, really. I think this is separate. This is going to go really very, very quickly.â€ Congressional Republicans have not spelled out their plan for dealing with the budget and a related, must-pass increase in the federal debt ceiling. Some aides and analysts have speculated that those issues might be swept into a single piece of legislation, possibly including Harvey aid.  House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said on Monday that â€œRepublicans must be ready to join Democrats in passing a timely relief bill.â€ Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Brock Long said more than 450,000 people were expected to seek disaster assistance because of catastrophic flooding. â€œWe will help those affected by this terrible disaster. The first step in that process is a formal request for resources from the administration,â€ said AshLee Strong, spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan. A Senate Republican aide said it was too soon to say what was needed. â€œThe committee is monitoring the situation in Texas closely,â€ said Chris Gallegos, a spokesman for the Republican majority on the Senate Appropriations Committee. There is only about $3.3 billion in the federal disaster relief fund. Congress approved $62.3 billion in aid after Hurricane Katrina devastated Gulf Coast communities and flooded New Orleans in 2005. Texas Republican Representative Pete Sessions told MSNBC he expected lawmakers to back any aid package as long as it was not bloated beyond the needed storm response. Some conservatives have balked in the past at authorizing money for disaster relief. In 2005, then-Indiana Republican Representative Mike Pence, now vice president, called on the floor of the House for â€œoffsettingâ€ money spent on Katrina relief with cutbacks elsewhere. Almost the entire Texas delegation - including Sessions and Republican Senator Ted Cruz - opposed the $50.5 billion aid package that Congress approved three months after Hurricane Sandy hit New Jersey and New York in 2012. Opponents argued that the Sandy package funded things unrelated to the disaster.       â€œThe Sandy relief bill had more pork in it than a bacon factory,â€ said Representative Blake Farenthold, a Republican who represents Corpus Christi, which was hit hard by Harvey. Republican Representative Pete King of New York said in a Twitter message on Monday: â€œI wonâ€™t abandon Texas the way Ted Cruz did New York.â€ ",Real

"The Sean Spicer Show: White House spokesman's brief season WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sean Spicer burst onto the public stage six months ago with a scolding rant against reporters, accusing them of lowballing the size of President Donald Trumpâ€™s Inauguration Day crowd.  Following a turbulent half-year run as White House press secretary, Spicer is leaving the building with a final burst of drama after rejecting what amounted to a downsizing of his role. Until he got swept up in Trumpâ€™s orbit, Spicer had been a party functionary for the Republican National Committee, well known and respected among Washington political operatives and reporters but with no national profile. As Trumpâ€™s frontman at televised White House news briefings, however, the 45-year-old achieved a certain fame for defending the president at all costs through a variety of crises that have beset Trumpâ€™s young presidency. He became instantly recognizable around the country and an inspiration for social media memes. His live televised briefings drew big audiences for cable TV. Spicer was lampooned on NBCâ€™s â€œSaturday Night Live,â€ with Melissa McCarthy playing the combative â€œSpiceyâ€ character, swallowing gum and driving a motorized lectern into actors playing reporters who asked hard questions.  Asked what he thought of the show, Spicer told Fox News in an interview on Friday: â€œI think that there were parts of it that were funny, but thereâ€™s a lot of it that was over the line. It wasnâ€™t funny. It was stupid, or silly, or malicious.â€ Over time, however, Trump felt he was not being defended strongly enough by his communications team and that there were not enough people advocating for him on TV, according to a Republican close to the White House. In a crushing snub, Spicer, a devout Roman Catholic, was kept off the list of White House officials who met Pope Francis when Trump visited the Vatican in May.  With Trump eager to make changes in his communications team, the president began courting Anthony Scaramucci, a New York financial whiz who has been an eloquent defender of Trump in TV interviews. Scaramucci is a prominent Republican fundraiser who advised Trump during his presidential campaign last year after working first on rival Scott Walkerâ€™s campaign until it fizzled. Trump met Scaramucci on Thursday and talked about making him communications director, and planned a formal job interview and offer on Friday.  Spicer was dubious when told he would continue in the duties of press secretary and communications director with Scaramucci, who is not experienced in the ways of Washington, taking over the ceremonial title, a source close to the White House press operation said. â€œThis is a joke,â€ the source said. â€œTrump wanted Scaramucci on television as a surrogate for the White House and wanted to give him more of a formal title. There was simply no understanding by the president that the communications director title comes with lots of responsibilities, not just going on television.â€ When Trump went ahead with the hire on Friday and asked Spicer to stay on, Spicer had had enough, telling the president he was resigning, the source said. After the announcement was made to the White House communications staff at midmorning, White House chief of staff Reince Priebus huddled with Spicer and Scaramucci privately. Spicer told Fox News the president did not want him to go and had been â€œvery gracious throughout this process.â€  â€œI just thought it was in the best interest of our communications department, of our press organization to not have too many cooks in the kitchen,â€ he said. Trump tweeted late on Friday: â€œSean Spicer is a wonderful person who took tremendous abuse from the Fake News Media - but his future is bright!â€      Spicer, spotted around the White House complex, was described by colleagues as in a good mood and feeling he had made the right decision.

" Trump Tried To FIRE The Woman He Worked So Hard To Sleep With After She Spurned Him The woman that Trump claimed he tried so hard to sleep, and admittedly failed to do so, is Nancy O Dell, who hosted the Miss USA pageant in 2004 and 2005. Trump spoke of sexually assaulting her in 2005, but what many may not know is that he apparently tried to have her fired after that.At the time, he said he didn t like the way she looked while she was pregnant. TMZ reported, back in 2007, that Trump couldn t do that. O Dell s contract was with NBC, not with Trump, and he got overruled. O Dell kept her job, and Trump got to sulk in the background.So the  official  reason for wanting to fire her was that he didn t like the way she looked pregnant. Knowing Trump, though, he was butthurt that she d spurned him and wanted to punish her for the audacity. This is the man that pretended to be a PR person to hype up his own prowess with women back in the early  90s, after all.Trump claims he was just joking with Billy Bush on an  Access Hollywood  bus when the ahem disgustingly unfortunate comments about assaulting O Dell were made. O Dell was slated to host Miss USA with Bush that year, making this all the more terrible.Billy Bush is now a co-host of NBC s  Today Show,  and is probably in some hot water, considering this is the third time he s given NBC problems. He issued an apology for his role in pushing sexual harassment and assault as something men can just do when they re famous, saying: I was younger, less mature, and acted foolishly in playing along. I m very sorry. Yeah, younger and less mature totally excuses this. It also totally excuses trying to fire her afterward. Trump s true motives may never be known, but it s highly suspicious, and knowing Trump, it s because her rejection just rankled him and he had to put her in her place.Photo of Donald Trump by Ralph Freso/Getty Images.

"Trump's proposal to scrap Chemical Safety Board draws criticism (Reuters) - President Donald Trumpâ€™s proposal to do away with the federal agency that investigates chemical accidents drew sharp criticism from environmental, labor and safety advocates, who said that  eliminating the watchdog would put American lives at risk. Christine Todd Whitman, the former U.S. Environmental Protection Agency head, on Thursday called the proposal to get rid of Chemical Safety Board (CSB) and cut EPA funding short-sighted, saying both have long been an industry target for advocating greater public information on chemicals.   â€œIf you want to put the American people in danger this is the way to do it,â€ she said of the presidentâ€™s proposal to cut the CSBâ€™s funding entirely from the 2018 federal budget. â€œThe chemical industry has fought back from the beginning.â€  The CSB investigates major chemicals accidents to search for their causes and makes recommendations that could prevent a recurrence. It has no regulatory power, but is influential because its recommendations are often adopted by industry, labor, government officials, the EPA and Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The president on Thursday outlined a plan for fiscal 2018 discretionary spending, which exclude programs like Social Security, that removes allocations for 19 independent bodies, including the CSB and Corporation for Public Broadcasting.      The CSB, which has an annual budget of about $12 million, defended its work, saying its work has broadly improved safety. â€œAs this process moves forward, we hope that the important mission of this agency will be preserved,â€ the agency said in a statement.  Chemical and energy industry officials offered limited comment on the proposal. Petroleum and refining industry groups, Exxon Mobil Corp, BP plc and Tesoro Corp did not respond or declined to comment directly on the potential phase out. The American Chemistry Council, a trade group that represents major chemicals producers, said in a statement it would work with the administration and Congress to â€œensure EPA has funding to carry out essential responsibilities.â€ It did not comment directly on the CSB. The American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry trade group, said it looked â€œforward to working with the administration and Congress as all of these issues work their way through the budget process.â€ Michael Wright, director of health, safety and environment at the United Steelworkers union, said the CSBâ€™s recommendations generally have been welcome by labor and industry. One such recommendation that stemmed from a fatal 2005 refinery incident  included barring portable trailers that cannot withstand an explosion.  The boardâ€™s reviews of major accidents have proved significant. Its probes have led to industry standards on worker fatigue, greater reporting of hazardous chemicals to first responders, and have prompted companies to keep workers not directly involved in projects out of harmâ€™s way.  In California, many of the boardâ€™s safety recommendations have been drafted into law. For example, the state worker safety agency, known as Cal/OSHA, has doubled its investigative staff based on CSB recommendations. â€œThis is one of the best bargains in Washington,â€ said the USWâ€™s Wright. â€œIf it has prevented even one accident, it has saved far more money than its budget over its entire history.â€ Its probe of the fatal Deepwater Horizon rig explosion was controversial because of its two-year length and extensive need for outside help. The work led to new standards for safety in the offshore oil industry and in well equipment.  But some recommendations have not been yet been implemented. After a fatal 2013 explosion in West, Texas, that killed 12 first responders the CSB proposed facilities that store large amounts of fertilizer be covered by emergency planning laws that give first responders more information. That remains open.  Beth Rosenberg, a former CSB board member and now an assistant professor at Tufts University School of Medicine, said the CSB â€œdoes excellent work; other countries admire this agency.â€ She said opponents â€œdonâ€™t know what theyâ€™re doing here or how useful this board is.â€  ",Real

" Republican Lawmaker Introduces Bill To Eliminate The Department Of Education Entirely Republicans are apparently hell-bent on destroying public education any way they can. The Senate confirmed Betsy DeVos as secretary of education in a 51-50 vote on Tuesday. And as if that weren t enough, a GOP representative introduced a bill to do away with the Department of Education entirely.Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie introduced the one-page bill, which states that the Department of Education would terminate on Dec. 31, 2018. Now, to be honest, I could understand if this were a panicked, knee-jerk reaction to DeVos  confirmation. Kind of a  smoosh it before it lays eggs  response. It wouldn t make it a good idea, but it would be understandable. Sadly, that doesn t appear to be the case at all.Massie wants to eliminate the agency, which has been in place since 1980, because he just doesn t think the federal government should be in charge of education. Instead, he thinks the issue would best be left to states and local municipalities. (Insert eye roll here.) Unelected bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. should not be in charge of our children s intellectual and moral development. States and local communities are best positioned to shape curricula that meet the needs of their students,  Massie said in a statement.Massie isn t alone on this one, as seven other Republicans have also signed onto his bill: House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (Utah) and Reps. Justin Amash (Mich.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.), Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Jody Hice (Ga.), Walter Jones (N.C.) and Ra l Labrador (Idaho).The bill was introduced shortly after Vice President Mike Pence cast his tie-breaking to confirm DeVos. All Democrats voted against her and two Republicans, Sens. Susan Collins (Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), broke ranks with their party and opposed her confirmation as well.

"Maryland lawmakers pass bill to curb immigration enforcement (Reuters) - Marylandâ€™s House of Delegates on Monday approved legislation to bar police statewide from checking the immigration status of individuals they arrest or keeping them locked up longer than otherwise warranted at the request of federal agents seeking to deport them. The state Senate in Annapolis, which like the lower house of the General Assembly is controlled by Democrats, has yet to consider the bill, and Republican Governor Larry Hogan issued a statement vowing to veto the measure if it reached his desk. â€œThis legislation would interfere with our state and local law enforcementâ€™s ability to cooperate with federal law enforcement authorities,â€ Hogan said. Supporters say the measure, which cleared the House of Delegates on a largely party-line vote of 83-55, is designed in large part to maintain the trust of immigrant communities in local law enforcement and government agencies. It would prohibit state and local police officers from stopping, arresting, searching or detaining an individual for purposes of suspected immigration violations.  It would also bar police from honoring administrative â€œdetainerâ€ requests from federal immigration authorities seeking to keep jailed individuals in custody after they should otherwise be released on bond. Other provisions would require the state attorney general to issue guidelines to public schools, courthouses and hospitals on limiting immigration enforcement in those places. And it would restrict state funds from being used to create a registry of people on the basis of immigration status, nationality, religion or ethnic origin. The measure follows in the footsteps of dozens of municipalities and local jurisdictions across the country that have declared themselves â€œsanctuary cities,â€ including San Francisco, Chicago, Boston, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Seattle and Washington. So far no such statewide designations have been enacted. Republican President Donald Trump in January signed an executive order seeking to withhold federal funds from local governments that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities.  At the time, he said local jurisdictions put U.S. citizens at risk by releasing criminals who should be deported and who, in some cases, commit additional offenses after being released from jail.

" Hereâ€™s The Disgusting Letter The FBI Sent To MLK They Donâ€™t Want You To See (UNCENSORED IMAGE) While Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. s life and legacy are deservedly well-celebrated now, that was not always how he was viewed. Especially by those in authority.King was shaking up business as usual, and many, many people didn t like that. You can t change the world without ruffling a few feathers, and he definitely did that.In fact, here s an uncensored letter from the FBI to Dr. King that was posted by The New York Times from the National Archives.It read: KING,In view of your low grade, abnormal personal behavior I will not dignify your name with either a Mr. or a Reverend or a Dr. And, your last name calls to mind only the type of King such as KingHenry the VIII and his countless acts of adultery and immoral conduct lower than that of a beast. Click the image to read the letter in full:National Archives via NY TimesThey tell him: There is only one thing left for you to do. You know what it is. They are basically telling Dr. King to kill himself, and giving him a deadline or they ll  out  him, so to speak for all these allegedly evil doings. It s absurd, to be blunt. Absolutely disgusting, to be honest.While the nation praises Dr. King today, we cannot forget how ugly the past truly was, and horribly he was treated. This letter was sent only about 50 years ago. So, we ve come a long way in a short amount of time, but we still have such a long way to go.Featured image via J. Wilds/Keystone/Getty Images",Fake
"U.S. attorney general calls for efficient review of immigration cases WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Wednesday called on the nationâ€™s immigration courts to decide cases more efficiently, amid a burgeoning backlog that is hampering the Trump administrationâ€™s efforts to deport more illegal immigrants. Sessionsâ€™ memo to the Executive Office for Immigration Review, the agency under the Department of Justice that conducts immigration court proceedings, called on judges and staff to do what they can â€œconsistent with the lawâ€ to â€œincrease productivity, enhance efficiencies, and ensure the timely and proper administration of justice.â€ President Donald Trumpâ€™s administration has so far brought on 50 new immigration judges, Sessions said, in an effort to pare back a backlog of more than 600,000 cases. Sessions said in his memo that the Justice Department plans to hire 60 more judges in the next six months to cut the pending case load in half by 2020. Statistics released by the Department of Homeland Security on Tuesday showed that although the government arrested far more people suspected of being in the United States illegally in 2017 than it did last year, it deported fewer illegal immigrants. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement removed approximately 226,000 people from the country in the 2017 fiscal year, down 6 percent from the previous year and lower than at any time during the Obama administration. Trump has made strict immigration enforcement a major priority of his administration. The slowdown is in part because fewer people appear to be trying to cross the U.S. border illegally. Another reason is that although immigration arrests are up, the court backlog has slowed the removal of immigrants who claim they will be harmed if they are deported to their home countries or have other justifications for staying in the United States. Under U.S. policy, many of those claims must be adjudicated by an immigration judge.  In his memo, Sessions touted a surge of immigration judges to the U.S. border and said the agency completed about 2,800 more cases than projected. In April, Reuters reported that two of the eight immigration judges deployed to the U.S. border with Mexico to process asylum requests from migrant women and children were being recalled because they had so few cases to hear. The department also said that from February through November, removal orders were up 30 percent over the same time last year, and the percentage of final decisions on cases was up nearly 17 percent compared with last year.

" Republican Rep Sickeningly Justifies Obamacare Repeal: Poor People Donâ€™t Want Healthcare Republicans just keep digging their political graves deeper.The Affordable Care Act currently provides health insurance to 30 million Americans. The plans are broader than ever before and people can t be discriminated against just because they have a pre-existing condition.People who didn t have affordable access to medical care now have it.But Republicans have been trying to take it away from them for years and are still trying to do so even though Americans across the country have made it clear that they support the landmark healthcare law.The latest Republican to desperately try to justify repealing the Affordable Care Act is Kansas Rep. Roger Marshall, who claims the free market provides better and more affordable healthcare while also claiming that poor people don t want healthcare. Just like Jesus said,  The poor will always be with us,  Marshall told STAT News.  There is a group of people that just don t want health care and aren t going to take care of themselves. But Marshall, like most Republicans, is lying.As it turns out, people who gained health insurance through Medicaid expansion are, in fact, using preventive care services to take care of themselves.So saying that poor people don t want healthcare is absolutely ridiculous.But Marshall continued to insist that poor people don t want to take care of themselves. Just, like, homeless people.   I think just morally, spiritually, socially, [some people] just don t want health care. The Medicaid population, which is [on] a free credit card, as a group, do probably the least preventive medicine and taking care of themselves and eating healthy and exercising. And I m not judging, I m just saying socially that s where they are. So there s a group of people that even with unlimited access to health care are only going to use the emergency room when their arm is chopped off or when their pneumonia is so bad they get brought [into] the ER. Again, Medicaid recipients are using preventive services such as mammograms and cholesterol checks by an increase of 60 percent and 20 percent.In addition, Marshall envisions a healthcare system that only the wealthy can afford. In doing so, he based his vision on the hospital he ran before taking office. Our vision was that we would look more like a hotel with customer service that delivered five-star health care,  he said.  So our cafeteria looks more like a coffee shop than it does a sterile hospital dining room. We have bright windows everywhere, and outside of every window there s a garden. Thinking that healing is more than just a knife and a needle. The price of a stay at a five-star hotel can range well into the hundreds upwards to thousands of dollars per night, hardly something a low-income American can afford.While Marshall argues that free market healthcare is more affordable, the facts paint a far different picture.For example, a British couple were on vacation in New York when the woman unexpectedly went into labor 11 weeks early. She gave birth at a private hospital and was slapped with a $200,000 medical bill.The same thing happened to a Canadian woman who was vacationing in Hawaii, only she got slapped with a $1 million medical bill.These are the astronomical prices that Republicans like Marshall think Americans should have to pay. Such prices are financially crippling to low-income Americans, and medical bankruptcy is one of the major reasons why the Affordable Care Act was passed in the first place.Because while Marshall claims that government healthcare is more expensive, had the two women above given birth in their home countries, their care would have been free because Canada and England both have national healthcare services paid for through taxes. Even a private hospital a England would have only cost the British couple $15,000, far lower than the $200,000 bill issued by the kind of  five-star  American hospital Marshall thinks should be the future of healthcare.In short, Republicans don t think poor people should get access to affordable healthcare. They think healthcare is for rich people. That s morally repugnant and is exactly why Republicans should be ousted from office en masse in 2018. This country needs a healthcare system that works for everyone. Republicans are content with just letting people die.Featured image via Flickr",Fake

"Trump national security aides complete North Korea policy review: official WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trumpâ€™s top national security aides have completed a broad review of U.S. options aimed at countering North Koreaâ€™s nuclear and missile programs, a senior U.S. official said on Sunday. The review, which was accelerated to have it done before Trumpâ€™s summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping this week, includes a range of economic and military measures but leans towards new sanctions and increased pressure on Beijing to rein in its neighbor, the official said. The list of recommendations was put together by Trumpâ€™s National Security Council on his orders and was ready for his consideration, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.  It was not immediately clear if the review had reached the Republican presidentâ€™s desk or how quickly he would decide on a course of action, which could be delayed by the slow pace at which the administration is filling key national security jobs. The White House declined comment. Trump told the Financial Times in an interview published on Sunday that the United States was prepared to respond to North Korean nuclear threats on its own if China fails to pressure Pyongyang. Trump made clear he would he would urge China to use its influence with North Korea when he meets Xi at his Florida resort on Thursday and Friday for their first face-to-face meeting. The review, which was led by national security adviser H.R. McMaster, proposes a multi-pronged approach aimed at tightening the screws on North Korea economically and militarily, the official said. It will be up to Trump to decide how and when to proceed, and he could also send the review back for further work, the official said. While most details remained under wraps, senior U.S. officials told Reuters recently that options under consideration included tougher sanctions aimed at cutting North Korea off from the global financial system, which could entail â€œsecondary sanctionsâ€ against Chinese banks and firms that do the most business with Pyongyang. The U.S. official said Trump may warn Xi of such moves, including efforts to beef up South Korean and Japanese anti-missile defenses â€“ something Beijing strongly opposes. The Chinese have urged Washington to de-escalate tensions with Pyongyang and to find a way to restart negotiations, but U.S. officials say it would  be premature to resume talks now because it would be seen as a reward to North Korea for bad behavior. The chief U.S. concern is North Koreaâ€™s efforts to develop an intercontinental nuclear missile that could carry a nuclear warhead and be capable of hitting the United States. Although the long-standing option of pre-emptive military strikes against North Korea is not off the table, the review  gives priority to less-risky steps and â€œde-emphasizes direct military action,â€ the official said. Other steps that have been under consideration are escalating cyber attacks and other covert action aimed at undermining North Koreaâ€™s leadership, another U.S. source said recently. ",Real
"House backs massive increase in defense spending WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives passed its version of a massive annual defense bill on Friday, leaving out controversial amendments on transgender troops and climate policy but backing President Donald Trumpâ€™s desire for a bigger, stronger military. The vote was 344-81 to pass the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which sets military policy and authorizes up to $696 billion in spending for the Department of Defense. Underscoring bipartisan support for higher defense spending in Congress, 117 Democrats joined 227 Republicans in backing the measure. Only eight Republicans and 73 Democrats voted no. But the measure faces more hurdles before it can become law, notably because it would increase military spending beyond last yearâ€™s $619 billion bill, defying â€œsequestrationâ€ caps on government spending set in the 2011 Budget Control Act. Trump wants to pay for a military spending increase by slashing nondefense spending. His fellow Republicans control majorities in both the House and Senate, but they will need support from Senate Democrats, who want to increase military spending, for Trumpâ€™s plans to go into effect. The House NDAA also increases spending on missile defense by 25 percent, adds thousands more active-duty troops to the Army, provides five new ships for the Navy and provides a 2.4 percent salary increase for U.S. troops, their largest pay raise in eight years. And it creates a new Space Corps military service, pushed by lawmakers worried about China and Russiaâ€™s activities in space, but opposed by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. The Senate will vote on its version of the NDAA later this year, and the two versions must be reconciled before the measure can be sent to the White House for Trump to sign into law or veto. Trump has not threatened to veto the bill, but his administration listed several problems with it, including opposition to the proposed Space Corps and its failure to authorize new base realignments and closures. During debate on amendments to the NDAA this week, the House rejected a Republican-sponsored amendment that would have ended the Pentagonâ€™s policy of providing gender-reassignment surgery and other therapy for active-duty transgender service members. Lawmakers also defeated a proposed Republican amendment that would have prevented the Pentagon from implementing climate-change and green energy policies. ",Real

" WATCH: Nebraska Farmer Politely SHREDS Every Last Pro-Keystone XL Talking Point Fox News Host Has Landowners in Nebraska are understandably upset about the Trump administration greenlighting Keystone XL because it will run near or through their lands, most of which are farms. One man, Art Tanderup, who has a small, 160-acre farm in the path of Keystone XL, appeared on Fox News to discuss the problem. And he proved that he knows much more about it than the talking heads who keep trumpeting how great it is.Tanderup leads a group of 90 Nebraska farmers who are suing to stop Keystone XL s construction. When host Sandra Smith asked him if this was a  not in my backyard  thing, and whether he would fight it this aggressively if it wasn t in his backyard, he replied with: Yes we would. After we learned how destructive the chemicals in the tar sands are, we have come to realize that this type of fossil fuel should not be happening, and it doesn t matter where it s at. We need to look for other sources of renewable energy. Smith also asked him what the group s goals are, and he said: Our goal is to keep this pipeline out of the eastern sand hills of Nebraska and off the Ogallala aquifer. Our premium goal would be to leave the tar sands in the ground and move more rapidly to renewable fuels. There was discussion about the quality of tar sands oil, which is terrible   tar sands oil is dirty as hell, and refining it produces a byproduct that s worse than coal when burned (and guess what? We sell that byproduct to China, who then burns it!). It also only produces poor quality fuel, and Trans Canada would be sending it through the pipeline to Texas for refining, after which it would be exported overseas. We get no benefit at all except for possibly a few new jobs at a refinery.Smith tried to make the pipeline sound safer than rail when it comes to moving oil, and it is, but Tanderup even shot down that talking point. It was like she never even heard him say that his group believes the tar sands should stay where they are, or really, anything else he said.Watch below:Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",Fake
"Trump drops plan to create infrastructure council: White House WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has abandoned plans to create an infrastructure advisory council, the White House said on Thursday, the day after two other advisory groups were dismantled over the furor caused by Trumpâ€™s remarks on white supremacists. â€œThe Presidentâ€™s Advisory Council on Infrastructure, which was still being formed, will not move forward,â€ a White House official said. The decision to drop the planned council was first reported by Bloomberg. Trump signed an executive order last month establishing the council, with members to be drawn from real estate, construction, transportation and other sectors of the economy. Trump has proposed spending $1 trillion to fix aging U.S. roads, bridges, airports and other infrastructure, a major part of his legislative agenda along with healthcare and tax reform. On Wednesday, Trump disbanded two high-profile advisory groups after several chief executives quit in protest over his remarks blaming violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, last weekend on anti-racism activists as well as white nationalists. Trump said he dissolved the American Manufacturing Council and the Strategic and Policy Forum â€œrather than putting pressureâ€ on its members, although both groups were preparing to disband on their own when Trump made his announcement on Twitter. The snubs from chief executives raised questions about Trumpâ€™s ability to marshal the business community behind his policy goals. A Wall Street analyst, Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama, said that because the infrastructure panel had yet to get off the ground, its demise was less important than the scrapping of the other two groups. â€œBut it contributes to the uncertainty thatâ€™s creeping inâ€ about Trumpâ€™s agenda, Hellwig said.

" Trump Asks Advice From The Swamp He Promised To Drain â€“ Americans Are OUTRAGED At What They Said Not too long after taking office, Trump decided to start asking around about how the government could roll back regulations and make it easier for companies to get their projects approved. But he didn t ask ordinary Americans, or small business owners. He didn t ask people in small towns and big cities. He asked big corporations what their opinions were. He sought advice from the same people he blasted as  The Swamp  during his campaign, and promised repeatedly to drain it.Now, given who he s appointed to his cabinet, it was pretty clear that he had zero intention of draining the swamp. Trump specifically targeted manufacturers and fossil fuel producers for this, probably because he thinks allowing them to run roughshod will at least help him pretend he s truly bringing manufacturing jobs back. But this is even more egregious because major industry insiders don t care about people. They don t care who they hurt in pursuit of the almighty dollar. Of course they want industry regulations cut   these are the industries people fought (and died) against to stop things like child labor and worker exploitation.The White House got 168 comments total. Manufacturers went after the EPA the hardest, with 79 of those comments targeting that agency. The EPA received 79 comments total, because of course it did. And companies targeted the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts with 48 and 29 comments respectively, because having to clean up after yourself so everyone around you can breathe clean air and drink clean water is just too difficult.Trump s decision to halt key provisions of the Clean Water Act has already angered people, particularly those living in communities that are especially vulnerable to poisoned water. The director of the Sierra Club s  Beyond Coal  campaign has said: Trump s attempt to halt these clean water protections for mercury, lead, and arsenic from coal power plants is dangerous and irresponsible. After years of peer-reviewed studies, extensive input from medical experts and scientists, and thorough review of public comments, the EPA made the right call in finalizing strong clean water protections against coal plants dumping toxic heavy metals into our waterways As a mother, I m frankly horrified that the EPA would put the safety of drinking water at risk for millions of Americans, but that s exactly what they ve done. Coming from West Virginia, where we ve had enormous challenges with maintaining clean water supplies due to the coal industry s political influence, I m outraged that these common sense protections are under attack from the EPA itself. But, well, profit is king here, even though the coal industry is never going to recover no matter what Trump tries to do. A full breakdown of the agencies and regulations that these companies would like to see rolled back, if not outright eliminated, is below:BP says it wants to make it easier to drill for gas and oil in the very same Gulf that was devastated in the Deepwater Horizon disaster, because why force them be careful when they can lie about being able to self-regulate? (Big corporations can t self-regulate.) And The Associated General Contractors of America wants to roll back regulations for paid sick leave for government contractors. They probably want to get rid of overtime rules, too.Of course, business groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are applauding Trump for this. They see this administration as one that is finally interested in relieving businesses  from a regulatory onslaught that occurred, principally, during the prior administration. Others are not so sure this is the best way to do things, though, because companies will always, always, always act in their own best interests, and damn the rest of the world. Jeffrey Zients, who worked on regulatory issues under Obama, said: At a time when many CEOS are focused on the short term and looking to maximize their profitability each quarter, I believe that a lot of their aversion to these regulations reflects a short-term mind-set that values reducing costs over anything else.That s unfortunate, because well-crafted regulations are an important part of creating sustainable and fair economic prosperity in the long run. A detail. These companies don t want sustainable and fair economic prosperity in the long run. They want unfair and profitable in the short run. It s the nature of the beast. And it s why the business world needs strong regulation. Instead, Trump is trying to give them back the ability to do what they want, when they want, how they want, without regard to the harm they cause.Featured image by Ron Sachs   Pool via Getty Images",Fake

At six-foot-four and 275 pounds of pure muscle, Bennett wears a smaller version of standard NFL shoulder pads so they don t get in his way as he crushes his opponents on the field. But this beast of a man, compliant in every way, finally encountered something that made him fear for his life: The police.Any Seahawks fan   and I am one of the biggest   will tell you that Michael Bennett is the last person that would ever be a suspect in any kind of violent crime. If he seems like a monster when he gears up, it is in polar opposite to his life off the field. He lives in Hawaii with his wife and three young daughters. His brother Martellus, a tight end for the Packers, writes children s books. Michael collaborates with his brother s business, The Imagination Agency. He is a happy man.But today he is not happy. If NFL fans thought they were going to get players to stop protesting during the national anthem by complaining about their patriotism, they should seek out Michael Bennett and ask him how much he loves this country. Bennett is a proud American, standing up against the police brutality that has claimed so many young black lives, and almost claimed his own.Featured image via Elsa (Staff)/Getty Images",Fake

Eight and a half hours passed after the initial spate of Blumenthal tweets, and Trump was still fuming about him.It turns out Trump has more to be upset with Blumenthal over than his supposed lies about Vietnam, and it wasn t just his appearance earlier in the day on CNN s New Day, where he discussed the ongoing investigation into Trump s collusion with Russia.According to a Jeffrey Toobin article in the New Yorker from June 20th, Senator Blumenthal is the Democrat most likely to succeed in having his case against Trump heard regarding violations of the  emoluments clause  of the Constitution. From the article:Other lawsuits against Trump, on emoluments grounds, have been filed, including one by the governments of Maryland and the District of Columbia (none have yet been decided), but Blumenthal believes that his suit will be the one that survives a challenge on standing grounds.  The clause specifically says that the President needs the consent of Congress to receive this money from foreign countries, so he s deprived us of the chance to give our consent,  Blumenthal said.  I think that s enough for us to get into court. Notably, if Judge Emmet Sullivan, of the federal district court in Washington, allows the case to proceed, the plaintiffs may be allowed to obtain Trump s elusive tax returns as part of the discovery process.So there s that. Looks like Mr. PhonyPants McDraftDodger was doing a little projecting about Vietnam because he was afraid of the war Blumenthal is bringing down on him, right here at home.Blumenthal had the last laugh:Mr. President: Your bullying hasn't worked before and it won't work now.

"Texas governor draws criticism for joke about shooting journalists AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Texas Governor Greg Abbott joked about shooting journalists while visiting a gun range on Friday to sign a bill lowering the cost of a handgun license, drawing criticism from gun-safety and free-press advocates who called his remarks â€œdangerous.â€ Abbott signed the bill at an indoor gun range in Austin, the state capital, then demonstrated his own shooting skills at an upstairs firing gallery before holding up his bullet-pocked target and quipping, â€œIâ€™m gonna carry this around in case I see any reporters.â€ A photo of the moment, published by the Texas Tribune, showed the grinning first-term Republican governor pointing to the center of the paper target, where three rounds had pierced the bullâ€™s eye circle.  His comment drew sharp rebukes from Reporters Without Borders, headquartered in Paris, and the Washington-based Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. Both said the incident was especially troubling as it came amid increasingly hostile rhetoric directed against the news media by Republican President Donald Trump and his supporters. â€œThis joke was dangerous and out of line. Because itâ€™s never just a joke to some,â€ Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence said in a statement. â€œWords matter. In a state and country where dangerous people can still so easily buy guns without a background check, leaders of every political stripe should be careful not to green light violence on their behalf.â€ The two groups also cited the misdemeanor assault charge filed on Wednesday against Republican Congressman-elect Greg Gianforte of Montana, accused of body-slamming a reporter who asked him about healthcare on the eve of his election. â€œPoliticians must condemn this dangerous rhetoric against reporters as it can quickly escalate to physical violence like we saw in Montana,â€ Reporters Without Borders said in a Tweet. The groupâ€™s latest annual World Press Freedom Index of 180 countries ranks the United States at No. 43, one rung below the tiny West African nation of Burkino Faso. â€œWeâ€™re really seeing just how much America deserves that ranking right now,â€ said Margaux Ewen, the organizationâ€™s U.S. advocacy director. Abbottâ€™s office did not respond to requests by Reuters for comment. The bill he signed will cut fees for a first-time license to carry a handgun from $140 to $40, and lower the renewal fee from $70 to $40, starting in September. It also waives the fees for peace officers and members of the military. â€œNo law-abiding Texan should be priced out of the ability to exercise their Second Amendment rights,â€ Abbott said in signing the measure.

" WTF: Top Trump Advisor Tells Trump To Kill Liberals (AUDIO) As if Donald Trump isn t paranoid and delusional enough on his own, one of the people who carries a lot of influence with 45 is one of the most certifiably insane (in my amateur opinion) people to ever hit the airwaves, rabid right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Jones is now advising Trump to use violence against those who oppose him, and the frightening thing is, Trump could listen.On his YouTube channel show on Monday, Jones fed into Trump s ridiculous conspiracy theory that his offices were wiretapped by President Obama.And I feel so sorry for people that can t see it, that have been caught by this weird demon spirit of the age, to just go along with evil and corruption and just thank god, Mr. President, that we re not the scumbag Obama, the loser of eight years, the failure. Now who thinks he can be the big community organizer down the street from you, who brags it s his plan to bring you down. Then The New York Times acts like it s not true. Codify the data each day, go after them with their own words. Hold up where they admit they were wiretapping your Trump Tower and then show The New York Times saying they re not doing it, just like you have been doing it, and they will fall.There were even more paranoid rantings, but the bottom line was that Trump should kill all his enemies before they take him down:They re going to destroy you, they re going to destroy Barron, they re going to destroy Eric, they re going to destroy Donald Jr., they re going destroy me, they re going to destroy Matt Drudge, they re going to destroy Ron Paul, they re going to destroy anybody like [White House senior adviser] Stephen Bannon that actually stood up for the little people, because that example can t be allowed. Because if you let one ant stand up, they might all stand up, and those little ants outnumber the parasites 1000 to one. If they want a war, let s let them have it. Now they re getting their ass kicked in the economy, your approval ratings are going up. Sir, they don t care. They re going to intimidate and pay off and roll people in your second-level operation to try to burn you. You must go on the offense. This is war. You think George Washington kicked the Redcoats  ass just with information? No.Source: Media MattersThen, with no irony at all, he accused Trump s opponents of being funded by the Russians.Here s the audio:Most people would just dismiss Jones s words as the rantings of a lunatic, which they are, but Trump loves Jones.

" Trump Live Tweets About â€˜Fox And Friendsâ€™ While Mass Shooting In Orlando Unfolds Trump spent his second day having a mental breakdown on Twitter with no signs of stopping. Situations around the world are at a particularly dire moment   the Middle East on the brink of war, the terror attack in London, a major infrastructure bill being drawn up   but Trump woke up and immediately turned on the Fox News morning entertainment show, Fox and Friends. Instead of getting his morning intelligence briefing, he live-tweeted incoherently about whatever subjects the Fox hosts brought up.First Trump s Muslim ban Then how Democrats are  obstructing  his ambassadorship picks. (Fact check: They aren t. Trump has nominated almost no one and most spots remain vacant due to his inaction.).@foxandfriends Dems are taking forever to approve my people, including Ambassadors. They are nothing but OBSTRUCTIONISTS! Want approvals.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2017Finally, he once again viciously lashed out at the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan, taking his original lie and adding even more lies on top to smear the British politician.Pathetic excuse by London Mayor Sadiq Khan who had to think fast on his ""no reason to be alarmed"" statement. MSM is working hard to sell it!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2017The mayor s  no reason to be alarmed  quote comes from a larger message where he told British citizens that they would be seeing an increased police presence and that the number of cops was  no reason to be alarmed.  Trump stripped the context and pretended the mayor was saying that terror attacks were no reason to be alarmed. Trump said that because on Fox and Friends yesterday a guest made a similar claim. He either hasn t been corrected about the false information he learned on Fox News or doesn t care.Trump did all of this while a mass shooting in Orlando unfolded. Unlike the terror attack in London, this one was a workplace dispute and done with a gun. Five people died.Five people were killed in a shooting at Fiamma, a business on North Forsyth Road near Hanging Moss Road near Orlando, the Orange County Sheriff s Office reported this morning, calling it a  tragic incident. The shooter   a former  disgruntled employee  who was fired in April   then killed himself, shooter, Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said. The shooter had previously been accused of battering a fellow employee.Trump, who needs reasons to justify his Muslim ban, doesn t seem to care much about mass shootings that don t fit the narrative that only scary Islamic terrorists are capable of violence. His silence on the shooting speaks volumes. It was also in stark contrast to his earlier response to London.When a tragedy hit London, he quickly retweeted an unsubstantiated claim made by right-wing conspiracy site, the Drudge Report. He then spent the night and next morning going on a rant about Muslims. He urged people in England to be scared, doing the work of the terrorists for them.In contrast, when a nearly equal number of Americans die in a way that is painfully normal for the country with a major gun violence problem, Trump can t be bothered to even offer condolences. But then, Fox and Friends, which also hates to acknowledge gun violence, probably didn t mention the shooting so how would our president ever know about it?Featured image via Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images",Fake
"U.S. interior secretary raised political funds on government trip: report WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. Department of the Interior came under further scrutiny on Thursday amid a media report that he had attended a Republican fundraiser in March during a government trip to the Caribbean. Politico, citing department travel records and other documents, said Ryan Zinke attended a Virgin Islands Republican Party fundraiser where donors paid up to $5,000 per couple for a photograph with the secretary. The report comes as multiple investigations into the former one-term congressmanâ€™s travel while serving in the Trump administration were announced this week following various media reports on the subject.  On Monday, the Interior Departmentâ€™s watchdog agency said it was probing Zinkeâ€™s travels after recent reports that he had used a private plane owned by an oil executive. On Tuesday, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel said it was investigating whether he broke the law in June when he gave a speech to a professional hockey team owned by a political donor. Other Cabinet members have also been scrutinized over their use of taxpayer money for more expensive private travel rather than less expensive commercial trips.  Former U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price resigned on Friday following an uproar over his use of costly private charter planes. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt have also come under question over their private plane use.  Questions have also been raised about the cost of security for U.S. Education Secretary Betsy Devos. Democratic House lawmakers earlier this week called on Zinke to disclose the full details of all of his privately chartered airplane trips. In a letter to the secretary, lawmakers pointed to one reported $12,000 private flight from Nevada to Montana, a route they said commercial airlines charge as little as $300 for. â€œAbuse of taxpayer money has so far been a problem for the Trump administration,â€ the group of 26 lawmakers wrote on Tuesday.  Representatives for Zinke did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Politico report Thursday.  Separately, the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has said he is seeking information on any private, non-commercial or military flights taken by White House counselor Kellyanne Conway.  U.S. Representative Elijah Cummings, in a statement released on Wednesday, also said he was seeking evidence that Price had repaid U.S. taxpayers for his private flights.  Representatives for the White House said on Thursday that U.S. agencies were responsible for arranging their own transportation, and that Cabinet members â€œoccasionally invite relevant White House staff for official travelâ€ that is then â€œplanned and secured by the inviting agency.â€ ",Real
"Congress to fund more detention beds despite drop in border crossings WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Congress has agreed to fund an additional 5,300 detention beds for illegal immigrants, the House of Representatives Appropriations Committee said on Monday, less than half the number requested by President Donald Trump. The additional detention space was negotiated by Republican leaders with Democrats as part of a spending package Congress will vote on later this week to fund the government through September, according to two congressional sources familiar with the agreement.  The new beds will be added despite a sharp decline last month in apprehensions of people crossing the southern border with Mexico illegally. Immigration detention centers at the U.S. border have been operating at below capacity in recent months. The agreement will increase the number of immigration detention beds to 39,324 from 34,000 currently, according to a summary provided by the House Appropriations Committee. The White House in March requested bringing the total number of beds up to 45,700, saying the additional capacity was necessary to achieve the presidentâ€™s goal of â€œenhancing interior enforcement efforts and ending â€˜catch and releaseâ€™ for those apprehended at the border.â€   The budget summary did not break out the specific cost of the additional 5,300 beds, but said they would be included in an overall $1.5 billion increase in immigration enforcement funding.  The spending also includes more electronic monitoring and GPS tracking alternatives to detention, as well 100 additional officers to enforce immigration laws and funding for programs that increase coordination with local authorities on immigration enforcement. Â  A spokesman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which runs detention facilities, said the agency would not comment on the contents of the spending bill while the legislation is pending. The House Appropriations Committee did not respond to a request for comment.  From April 1-22, an average of 36,235 immigrants were in detention per day, according to the most recent statistics provided by ICE.  If border crossings and apprehensions continue to stay low, the administration could struggle to fill additional detention beds, unless it increases â€œarrests of undocumented immigrants in the interior with no criminal convictions and cuts back on releases of asylum seekers found to have legitimate claims,â€ said Kevin Landy, who served as assistant director at ICE during the Obama administration. Â Â Â  â€œICE is going to be under enormous pressure to fill those bedsâ€ to prove to Congress that the funding was needed, said Landy, who left his post in January. Democrats raised similar concerns during budget negotiations, a Congressional aide with knowledge of the negotiations told Reuters.  Some Republicans as well as Democrats also expressed worries during the negotiations that the Department of Homeland Security might redirect money allotted for detention centers to use on border wall construction if Congress appropriated more money than needed, the aide said.  In October, the first month of the 2017 fiscal year, 66,710 people were apprehended crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally. Apprehensions have fallen steadily since then. Â   In March, 16,600 individuals were apprehended, down 64 percent from the year-earlier month, according to statistics from Customs and Border Patrol. ",Real
"U.S. Senate votes to confirm Jay Clayton as SEC chairman WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate voted on Tuesday to confirm attorney Jay Clayton to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, the agency tasked with policing and writing rules for Wall Street. In a 61-37 vote, the Senate approved the nomination, with some moderate Democrats joining their Republican colleagues in supporting his confirmation. Clayton could be officially sworn in as SEC chairman as soon as Thursday. The White House still must complete some paperwork, including an action by President Trump to formally designate him as SEC chairman. Clayton is a longtime partner at law firm Sullivan & Cromwell who specializes in advising clients on public and private mergers and acquisitions and capital-raising efforts.  Clayton worked on the initial public offering of Alibaba Group Holding Company, and has also represented Goldman Sachs, where his wife Gretchen works.  She is now expected to step down from her post, a move that will make it easier for her husband to mitigate potential conflicts of interest. â€œI look forward to working closely with my fellow Commissioners and the dedicated career staff at the SEC to serve the American public and advance the SECâ€™s important mission,â€ Clayton said in a statement. Many current and former SEC staffers are optimistic about Claytonâ€™s leadership, and Clayton is expected to focus some of his efforts on looking for ways to ease regulatory burdens that might hinder companies from raising capital. But in the debate leading up to the Senate vote on Tuesday, more progressive-leaning Democrats said they were concerned his close ties to Wall Street will create too many conflicts and may lead to weaker oversight. â€œMr. Claytonâ€™s law firm and former clients will create a steady stream of conflicts for him, forcing him to recuse himself in cases involving former clients for two of the four years he could serve as chair,â€ said Ohio Democrat Sherrod Brown, the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee.  â€œHe will be sitting on the sidelines of potential enforcement actions against some of the biggest Wall Street banks - Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, Royal Bank of Canada, and UBS,â€ he added.

"Lockheed gets Pentagon approval for $27 billion helicopter program (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp received Pentagon approval on Tuesday to begin production of 200 new heavy cargo helicopters for the U.S. Marines, the Department of Defense said. The long-expected award for the CH-53K King Stallion will on average cost $87 million each and $105 million including spare parts and certain service contracts, a Defense Department official had told Reuters last week.  The approval of the $27 billion program, which includes more than $6 billion in research and development costs, is a major milestone for the largest U.S. defense contractor.  The new helicopter, developed by Lockheedâ€™s Sikorsky helicopter business, can lift 36,000 pounds and would replace the CH-53E Super Stallion, which has operated as the backbone of field logistics for the U.S. Marines since the mid-1980s. The first four helicopters are scheduled for delivery next year, with another two to follow, the Defense Department said. The Marine Corps intends to transition eight active duty squadrons, one training squadron, and one reserve squadron from CH-53E to CH-53K, according to the statement. ",Real
" FACT: Donald Trumpâ€™s Education Plan Would Mass-Fire Teachers And DECIMATE Pell Grants If Donald Trump had his way, 14 percent of American teachers would lose their jobs. While the United States already faces a critical shortage of teachers not seen since the 1990s, Trump s plan would eliminate these crucial teaching positions as well as decimating Pell grants used by millions of students every year to achieve higher education.How would he do this? Trump, appeasing to the far-right fringe of the Republican Party, has pledged to eliminate the Department of Education. For years Republicans   from Ron Paul to Rick Perry   have been pushing for the elimination of not just the DOE, but other Departments as well.A recent study from the Center of American Progress Action Fund used statistical analysis to show what would happen if the Department of Education really was done away with as Trump so wants to do. Well, the results are horrifying:The list goes on and on. The idea to eliminate the Department of Education may look good to someone who wants  less government,  but in reality it s a cold and heartless move that s being pushed by billionaire proponents of school choice, like the Koch Brothers.The Learning Policy Institute attributes the shortage of teachers due to monies and entities being slashed from districts and states (and the federal level) during the Great Recession. After slashing, schools and teachers suffered. Now Trump wants to slash the buffer zone between complete privatization of our schools and a robust public option that has greatly enriched our nation.The Congressional Budget Office, a non-partisan fiscal entity, said of closing the Department of Education:U.S. high school graduation rates are hitting all-time highs; dropout rates are at historical lows; college going rates are close to the highest they have ever been; and test scores across the country are improving. But the elimination of the protections and resources from the Department of Education could significantly hinder or even reverse these gains.Trump won t listen. Instead he ll pander to his rich ultra-conservative buddies who have now propped him up in this election. If Trump has his way, say goodbye to our education system.Featured image via Theo Stroomer/Getty Images ",Fake

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 17, 2016Most of us, at least those of us who are capable of critical thought, would probably not assume that the article was a positive portrayal of Trump s birther farce, but, well, we re talking about Trump. As for the article, no, it was pretty brutal toward Trump. Here are a few snippets:Donald Trump is, at heart, a showman. He rose to national fame thanks to star turns on reality TV in which he played the tough-talking boss to a group of aspirants hoping to become as successful as he has been in business. His great gift is the ability to draw attention   and then use that attention for his own, usually commercial, purposes.Trump might have read that far. He s proud of being a showman and he s pretty damned good at it, in much the same way that snake oil salesmen were good at their jobs.Trump may have outdone himself on Friday morning. He and his campaign touted a  major  announcement at his newly opened hotel in Washington, D.C., at 10 a.m. The word was that Trump would walk away from his past skepticism about President Obama s citizenship while also laying the blame for the birther movement at the feet of Hillary Clinton. (That, of course, isn t true   according to numerous fact-checkers   but no matter: Trump planned to say it anyway.)The article goes on to fact check some of Trump s many lies, especially in regard to the birther controversy. No, Hillary Clinton didn t start it and yes, Donald Trump has long been a birther.The Washington Post then went on to describe the event, and it wasn t flattering. This is how they described Trump s announcement:Three sentences from Trump himself   one that is totally false and two others that represent a total reversal from a position he held as recently as, well, Thursday night.Clearly, Trump didn t read the article, which is a little frightening.

" Nixon Historian Says Donald Trump Is More Petty And Vengeful (VIDEO) If you thought Richard Nixon was bad, just wait till Donald Trump gets in office.On a scale of 1-10, prominent Nixon expert Rick Perlstein rated Trump an  11  on just how  Nixonian  he is during an interview on MSNBC.Trump s obsession with revenge, his pettiness, his constant lying, and his desire to shut down the press paint a picture of a petulant child that goes beyond the personality displayed by the 37th President.In fact, Perlstein sees a lot of Nixon in Trump, but Trump is more outlandish and transparently authoritarian. Nixon was very shrewd and tactical, sedulous, careful  he wouldn t have been tweeting  he would have been saying,  Let s take away the Washington Post s broadcast licenses that they rely on for their revenue,  which, you know, Trump may be doing soon when he is granted the power of the executive office,  Perlstein warned.Indeed, Trump is poised to change the relationship between the White House and the press from one of cordiality and mutual benefit to one of antagonism and open hostility.Trump s refusal to accept facts makes him even more of a threat because he will now have the power to punish news outlets who write the truth about him.Host Christ Hayes pointed out that unlike Trump, Nixon had some self-control. Nixon would not have taken to the podium and said,  I don t like this person, this person and Dan Rather;  he was self-controlled enough to channel that! This is different insofar as this is all out there in public. Perlstein then explained how Trump may attack people who criticize him once he takes control of the full power of the government, including the NSA, which he could use as his personal  spying apparatus. Basically once Trump can find out anything enemies are up to and find out where their vulnerabilities are, maybe find embarrassing things about them  leak them to Breitbart and soon it s, you know, on CNN, God forbid MSNBC, then we re talking about a different ballgame. Hayes noted that such behavior by a president is ultimately what led to Nixon losing the trust of the American people and being forced to resign or face impeachment.Perlstein then warned that Trump could use the IRS to attack people and businesses who have slighted him and seek lists of names in departments so he can  cut them off at the knees,  which is something his transition team is already doing.Here s the video via YouTube.But even if Trump commits these impeachable offenses, Republicans in Congress don t care about the Constitution enough to actually do something about it.

"Tillerson will not meet Turkey opposition in Ankara visit this week WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will not meet members of Turkish opposition groups during a one-day visit to Ankara this week where talks with President Tayyip Erdogan will focus on the war in Syria, senior U.S. officials said on Monday. Thursdayâ€™s visit comes at a politically sensitive time in Turkey as the country prepares for a referendum on April 16 that proposes to change the constitution to give Erdogan new powers. A senior State Department official said Tillerson will meet with Erdogan and government ministers involved in the fight against Islamic State in Syria. â€œIt is certainly something we are very acutely aware of and the secretary will be mindful of while he is there,â€ one State Department official told a conference call with reporters, referring to political sensitivities ahead of the referendum.  American officials expect Erdogan and others to raise the case of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom the government accuses of orchestrating a failed coup last July. The focus of the Ankara talks is the U.S.-led offensive to retake Raqqa from Islamic State and to stabilize areas in which militants have been forced out, allowing refugees to return home, officials said. A major sticking point between the United States and Turkey is U.S. backing for the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, which Turkey considers part of the Kurdistan Workersâ€™ Party that has been fighting an insurgency for three decades in Turkey. But the United States has long viewed Kurdish fighters as key to retaking Raqqa alongside Arab fighters in the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). â€œWe are very mindful of Turkeyâ€™s concerns and it is something that will continue to be a topic of conversation,â€ a second U.S. official said. Turkey, Russia and Iran have held Syrian peace talks in Astana, Kazakhstan, on a ceasefire in Syria. The United States has proposed â€œareas of stabilityâ€ where Islamic State has been pushed out and refugees can be returned. Six years since the start of the uprising against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, he is winning on the battlefield although the war is far from over. The once stable country is broken into fiefdoms ruled by rebels and warlords. â€œWeâ€™re looking forward to discussing with Turkey how we can reinforce ceasefire negotiations through the Astana process,â€ the second U.S. official said.

" Americaâ€™s Most Corrupt Sheriff Set To Lose Re-Election Bid In A LANDSLIDE Two days ago, a poll from the Arizona Republic/Morrison/Cronkite News had Democrat Paul Penzone beating out Republican Joe Arpaio for the office of Sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona. Arpaio, who is seeking his seventh term, has branded himself America s  toughest  sheriff.He also has a reputation for being a lawless thug who uses racial discrimination to crack down on illegal immigration.In just two days, Arizonans have gone further with their dissatisfaction with America s  toughest sheriff. A brand new poll from the Arizona Republic/Morrison/Cronkite News, released early Thursday, shows Democrat Paul Penzone s lead growing astronomically. In just two days, Penzone has gone from a 10 point lead to a 15 point lead over Arpaio, 46 to 31 percent. Penzone skyrocketed in the polls after reports surfaced that federal prosecutors will charge him with criminal contempt after a judge recommended the charges stemming from a racial profiling case   in which the court found Arpaio and his posse willfully disobeyed the court s order not to racially profile.In August, a poll conducted by Cronkite found that 57.3 percent of registered voters in Maricopa county either found Arpaio  unfavorable  or  very unfavorable.  That was before it was announced that federal prosecutors would be charging him for breaking the law.The same poll released on Thursday also shows that 68 percent of Arizonans do not agree with deporting every illegal immigrant living in the state.Arpaio was first elected sheriff in 1992 and has won every election since. However, every election has shown Arpaio losing support. In 2000, Arpaio won with 65 percent of the vote. In 2012, the last election, he barely clinched a majority, just passing the 50 percent mark.Never before has a Democratic challenger surpassed Arpaio in the polls. Considering Clinton has a real shot at winning Arizona, and the two most recent polls show Arpaio losing by double digits, Arizona may become just a little bluer than ever before.And what a big F-You that would send to Trump s xenophobic, racist movement. Losing the state affected by illegal immigration the most and sending it s most ardent racist home with it. Forty-four percent of residents in Maricopa county do not support  the wall  Trump and Arpaio want to build, while only 13 percent do.Arizona, get ready to say goodbye to Joe Arpaio!Featured image via Ralph Freso/Getty Images",Fake
" Clinton Camp Just Obliterated Trumpâ€™s â€˜Shamefulâ€™ Excuse For Black Outreach Hillary Clinton s camp took aim at Donald Trump and his recent efforts to lure black voters into backing him, slamming his  minority outreach  efforts as  shameful, insulting and cowardly. Marlon Marshall, Hillary for America s Director of State campaigns and Political Engagement, released a statement on Thursday in response to the latest update on Trump s upcoming visit to an African-American church in Detroit. Not only will Trump not be speaking to the congregation, but the one-on-one interview he will be having with the pastor after the service will be carefully scripted. Donald Trump s latest gimmick to act as if he cares about the black community is downright shameful, insulting and cowardly,  Marshall wrote. After 14 months of neglecting us, Donald Trump is once again dodging substantive conversations and ducking questions about the issues that impact our community. Not surprisingly, Trump s ignorance on issues like the economy, criminal justice reform, the meaning of quality health care or systemic racism, has forced him to resort to scripted conversations and staged engagements with our communities. According to the leaked script, the questions that will be asked by Bishop Wayne T. Jackson will be written in advance and the GOP nominee s answers will be carefully prepared ahead of time as well. Marshall slammed Trump for this bogus attempt at  scripted  outreach to the black community. The problem is, our community can see through this: outreach to African Americans cannot be scripted; leaders ought to be prepared to address the hard truths about race and justice in our country,  Marshall wrote. And Trump s discomfort on addressing these issues only reinforces that he s unfit to be our president. Trump s so-called  minority outreach  has not been going over as well as he hoped. What was his master plan to woo black voters and make them forget that he is endorsed by the KKK? Tell them that their lives suck so bad already that they don t have anything to lose by voting for him. Gee, I simply can t imagine why bedbugs and the Bubonic plague are polling better than Trump among blacks and Hispanics right now.Featured image via Aaron P. Bernstein/Getty Images",Fake

Thank God really, literally  thank God we re not facing a third Obama term. If you caught PE-Trump s first presser today, you saw it,  she began.Palin went on to accuse the media of lying and even accused them of disrespecting our veterans before bragging about how Trump is  decimating  the press.For one, when PE-Trump takes on corrupt lying lapdog media it is vindication and validation for those without a microphone who ve been shot by reporters engaged in politics of personal destruction.These  journalists    bad characters that they are   hurt our nation tremendously; they disrespect those who fought and died to protect America s freedom of the press; they spit upon the graves of our veterans.

"Sessions says he will discuss Comey with Senate panel WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a letter on Saturday that he will appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday to address matters former FBI Director James Comey brought up this week in testimony to the same panel. In a letter seen by Reuters, Sessions told Senator Richard Shelby, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies, that the intelligence committee is the â€œmost appropriateâ€ place to address matters that came up during Comeyâ€™s hearing on Thursday. The letter did not say whether Sessions planned to give public testimony or to appear before the panel behind closed doors. â€œIn light of reports regarding Mr. Comeyâ€™s recent testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, it is important that I have an opportunity to address these matters in the appropriate forum,â€ Sessions said in the letter. The committee â€œis the most appropriate forum for such matters, as it has been conducting an investigation and has access to relevant, classified information,â€ he added. The Senate panel is investigating allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. In March, Sessions removed himself from any probe into alleged Russian meddling in the elections, but maintained he did nothing wrong by failing to disclose that he met last year with Russiaâ€™s ambassador. In testimony to the Senate panel on Thursday, Comey accused President Donald Trump of firing him to try to undermine the FBIâ€™s investigation of possible collusion by people in Trumpâ€™s campaign with Russiaâ€™s alleged efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election. Comeyâ€™s appearance raised new questions about the attorney generalâ€™s relationship with Russian officials and others with ties to President Vladimir Putin. One question is whether Sessions had any undisclosed meetings with Ambassador Sergei Kislyak or other Russians during the campaign or after Trumpâ€™s inauguration. In the most eagerly anticipated U.S. congressional hearing in years, Comey told lawmakers the Trump administration had lied and defamed him and the Federal Bureau of Investigation after the president dismissed him on May 9. Sessions had planned to appear before the Senate and House Appropriations Subcommittees, but the deputy attorney general will take his place, the letter said. ",Real
" Hannity Just Fired Off An ABSURD Tweet At CBS For Koppel Interview â€“ Twitter SHREDS Him For It Sean Hannity is pissed. Really pissed. Earlier today, he appeared on CBS   Sunday Morning  for an interview with veteran ABC News anchor Ted Koppel, which didn t go well for him. In that interview, Hannity did his level best to keep Koppel from making his point (meaning he was interrupting Koppel every chance he got), but Koppel wasn t having it. He literally said that he thinks Hannity and his ilk are  bad for America,  and dropped the hammer on why: You have attracted people who are determined that ideology is more important than fact. That s the truth, and Hannity doesn t like it. In a way, he s like Trump   he s not wrong, everyone else is wrong. Whether or not he agrees with something is what determines whether it is a fact. So, like his idol, President Cheeto McTinyhands, he took to Twitter to blast CBS for editing the interview the way they did: Fake Edited News  @CBSNews release the Unedited 45 minute interview so people can see the BS games you play in the edit room. I dare you! https://t.co/prynzE2yLQ  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) March 26, 2017 Fake Edited News,  and then a demand that they air the entire 45-minute interview is classic Donald Trump. But what can we expect? It s been obvious for a long time that he s in love with Trump. Now he s even copying him, so when can we expect Hannity to start stalking him?More to the point, though, as someone who himself conducts on-air interviews that have time constraints on them, Hannity is acting extremely hypocritically here.

"Foreign government code reviews 'problematic': White House cyber official WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Allowing foreign governments to require reviews of software secrets of technology products built by U.S. companies is â€œproblematic,â€ the top White House cyber security official said on Tuesday, adding that the increasingly common arrangements presented both security and intellectual property risks. Rob Joyce, the White House cyber security coordinator, said that letting countries inspect source code, the closely guarded internal instructions of software, as a condition for entry into foreign markets was a protectionist effort by certain regimes that threatened a â€œfree and open internetâ€ and could â€œhobbleâ€ a productâ€™s security and privacy features. Reuters on Monday reported that Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) last year allowed a Russian defense agency to review the inner workings of cyber defense software known as ArcSight that is used by the Pentagon to guard its computer networks. (Read the original Reuters special report: here ) Cyber security experts, former U.S. intelligence officials and former ArcSight employees said the practice could help Moscow discover weaknesses in the software, potentially helping attackers to blind the U.S. military to a cyber attack. â€œThere are security aspects of those disclosures (and) they are problematic,â€ Joyce, a former hacker at the U.S. National Security Agency, said at a Washington Post Cybersecurity Summit when asked specifically about the story. He added that he was more concerned about the intellectual property risks associated with the reviews, however. â€œIf you give your source code to China as a condition of entering into that market, youâ€™ve got to wonder if competitors are then going to start to adopt those features,â€ Joyce said at the event, which was sponsored by HPE. â€œAnd weâ€™ve seen some examples of that in the past and that really concerns us.â€ Asked about Joyceâ€™s comments, an HPE spokeswoman said the company â€œhas never and will never take actions that compromise the security of our products or the operations of our customers.â€ The company said the reviews have taken place for years and are conducted by a Russian testing company at an HPE research and development center outside of Russia, where the software maker closely supervises the process, and that no code is allowed to leave the premises. HPE has said the inspection process was necessary to obtain certification from Russiaâ€™s Federal Service for Technical and Export Control (FSTEC),  a defense agency tasked with countering cyber espionage, in order to sell software in Russia. The review of ArcSightâ€™s code was conducted by Echelon, a company with close ties to the Russian military, on behalf of FSTEC, according to Russian regulatory records and interviews with people with direct knowledge of the issue. British tech company Micro Focus International Plc (MCRO.L), which purchased ArcSight from HPE last year in a transaction completed in September, did not respond when asked about Joyceâ€™s remarks. Micro Focus has not responded to requests for comment on whether it would allow Russia to do similar source code reviews in the future. Russia in recent years has stepped up demands for source code reviews as a requirement for doing business in the country, Reuters reported in June. China in May adopted a new cyber security law that western companies have criticized for requiring overly strict data surveillance and storage requirements. The law has raised concern that companies will need to choose between compromising security to protect business and losing out on the enormous Chinese market. â€œThe idea that you canâ€™t enter Chinaâ€™s market without offering up your intellectual property in this way, without agreeing maybe to hobble some of the security and privacy features of it ... Russia is heading that way, a bunch of totalitarian regimes are heading that way,â€ Joyce said. ",Real

"FCC head silent on Trump comment about pulling broadcast licenses WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A suggestion by President Donald Trump that a U.S. regulator pull broadcast licenses from TV networks over what Trump calls â€œfake newsâ€ has been met by silence from the watchdogâ€™s head Ajit Pai, who has a history of defending free speech rights. Pai, who was reconfirmed last week for a new five-year term at the Federal Communications Commission and named chairman by Trump in January, has been urged by members of Congress to denounce Trump for a proposal that has little, if any, chance of success. That is because the commission does not actually license broadcast networks or cable stations and the hurdles to denying licenses to individual stations are extremely high. Trumpâ€™s remarks on Wednesday that threatened to muzzle the media and fellow-Republican Paiâ€™s strong support for press freedoms could conflict as Pai mounts ambitious plans to overhaul federal communications regulations. Trump said in a Twitter post: â€œNetwork news has become so partisan, distorted and fake that licenses must be challenged and, if appropriate, revoked. Not fair to public!â€ His ire was raised by an NBC News report that said he had called for a massive increase in the U.S. nuclear arsenal, a report Trump denied. Trump and his supporters have repeatedly used the term â€œfake newsâ€ to cast doubt on media reports critical of his administration, often without providing any evidence to support their case that the reports were untrue. Paiâ€™s office has declined to comment, despite Reutersâ€™ repeated requests Wednesday and Thursday. The FCC, an independent agency, does not issue licenses to individual networks but to local stations, including those directly owned by broadcasters such as Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O) that owns NBC. Comcast and NBC declined to comment on Trumpâ€™s remarks. Pai has defended the First Amendment and press freedoms. In October 2016, he said anyone at the FCC â€œhas the duty to speak out whenever Americansâ€™ First Amendment rights are at stake.â€ In a 2014 Wall Street Journal piece, Pai said â€œthe government has no place pressuring media organizations into covering certain stories.â€   Pai has an ambitious agenda, which he is expected to unveil details of in the coming months. It includes proposing to eliminate some significant media ownership restrictions and a plan to roll back former Democratic President Barack Obamaâ€™s so-called net neutrality rules. Senator Tom Udall, a New Mexico Democrat, said on Twitter Trumpâ€™s comments were â€œunacceptable attacks on the #FirstAmendment by @POTUS. @AjitPaiFCC committed to Congress to speak up at times like this. We are waiting.â€ U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan defended press freedoms Thursday but did not directly criticize Trump. â€œIâ€™m for the First Amendment. I donâ€™t always agree and like what you guys write, but you have a right to do it,â€ Ryan said. Republican Senator Ben Sasse asked if Trump was â€œrecantingâ€ the oath of office to defend the First Amendment.  In March, Pai told the U.S. Congress he did not agree with Trump when he said that â€œthe media is the enemy of the American people.â€ Pai said he would act independently of the White House on media-related matters. Last month, Pai lamented that people on Twitter demand â€œthe FCC yank licenses from cable news channels like Fox News, MSNBC, or CNN because they disagree with the opinions expressed on those networks. Setting aside the fact that the FCC doesnâ€™t license cable channels, these demands are fundamentally at odds with our legal and cultural traditions.â€ ",Real
"Boy Scouts of America apologizes for Trump's 'political rhetoric' NEW YORK (Reuters) - The head of the Boy Scouts of America apologized to members of the youth organization on Thursday for the â€œpolitical rhetoric that was insertedâ€ into its national gathering this week by U.S. President Donald Trump. â€œI want to extend my sincere apologies to those in our Scouting family who were offended by the political rhetoric that was inserted into the jamboree,â€ Michael Surbaugh wrote in an open letter published on the Scoutsâ€™ website. â€œThat was never our intent.â€ He said that every U.S. president, who serves as the Scoutsâ€™ honorary president, has been invited to speak at the national jamborees held every four years since 1937, but that the Scouts were nonetheless â€œsteadfastlyâ€ non-partisan.  â€œWe sincerely regret that politics were inserted into the Scouting program,â€ Surbaugh wrote. He said there were 40,000 participants, including Boy Scouts, volunteers, staff and visitors. Trump, a Republican, started his speech before thousands of boys aged 12 to 18 in a West Virginia field on Monday evening lauding hard work and perseverance, then quickly turned to partisan attacks and ridicule of â€œfake mediaâ€. He attacked Democratic rivals, lambasted the current healthcare law and reminisced about a cocktail party he went to decades ago filled with â€œthe hottest people in New York.â€ Trumpâ€™s speech drew intense criticism from former Scouts, parents of Scouts and others, with many saying the speech was not in keeping with Scout values and inappropriate. While many Scouting families expressed outrage, a few said the reaction was overblown, arguing that exposure to political speech in all forms was an important part of a Scoutâ€™s development. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said she had not seen Surbaughâ€™s letter of apology, and said she attended the event. â€œI saw nothing but roughly 40,000 to 45,000 Boy Scouts cheering the president on throughout his remarks and I think they were pretty excited that he was there,â€ Sanders said.

" WATCH: Retired Alabama Cop: We Were Told To Keep Roy Moore Away From High School Cheerleaders It seems that Republican candidate for Attorney General Jeff Sessions  vacated Senate seat Roy Moore s proclivity for teenage girls was well known decades ago in Gadsden, Alabama   even within the courthouse where he worked as an Assistant District Attorney, and even within the police department. Retired police officer Faye Gary spoke with MSNBC and said of the situation: The rumor mill was that he liked young girls, and   we were advised that he was being suspended from the mall because he would hang around the young girls that worked in the stores and   really got into a place of where they say he was harassing. We were also told to watch him at the ball games, and make sure that   he didn t hang around the cheerleaders. Faye Gary went on to say that she originally thought that Moore liked, perhaps, women in their 20 s   you know, LEGAL younger women. But, no. It was actually teenagers the old creep liked. Gary also said that Moore s liking for little girls   was a known fact,  while speaking with the New York Times, going on to say,  It was treated like a joke. That s just the way it was. Of course, Roy Moore has long been a controversial character. He was removed from the Alabama Supreme Court twice, both times refusing to follow the law. The first time it was over his refusal to removed a 5,000+ pound monument of the Ten Commandments from the Supreme Court building, and the second time for ordering officials around the state to refuse to comply with the United States Supreme Court s ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, which legalized marriage equality nation wide. He has also said that Representative Keith Ellison should not be allowed to serve in Congress because he is a Muslim. In other words, this is a man who has no regard for the rule of law, and is likely a child molester to boot.In short, the voters of Alabama need to reject this bigoted extremist, and, if they don t, they ll be sending a message to the rest of the nation: a child molester is much better to be seated in the Senate than a Democrat.Watch Faye Gary s comments on the matter below:Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",Fake

"White House to host fresh biofuels talks to help refiners: sources (Reuters) - The White House will host talks between the rival oil and ethanol industries on Wednesday in hopes of brokering a deal to help refiners struggling to meet the countryâ€™s biofuels policy, according to sources familiar with the matter. The meeting comes after the White House last week pressured Midwest lawmakers to take part in talks over possible tweaks to the Renewable Fuels Standard, a law that requires refiners to blend increasing amounts of biofuels, mainly corn-based ethanol, into the nationâ€™s fuel supply each year. A handful of refiners say the law is threatening to put them out of business. But ethanol interests have said the refineries can pass along the costs at the pumps and haveÂ vehemently opposed any changes to the regulation. The meeting on Wednesday will include staff from the offices of Republican Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, both representing the oil-refining industry, according to the sources.  On the corn side, staff will be present from the offices of Republican Senators Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst of Iowa, along with Deb Fischer of Nebraska, the sources said. Staff from the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Agriculture were also expected to attend. A spokesman for Grassley confirmed that â€œstaff-level dialogue and meetingsâ€ were under way but did not provide details. Officials for the other senators and the White House did not comment. One source familiar with the matter said the meeting would likely focus on short-term fixes to help oil refiners on the U.S. East CoastÂ who say they are struggling with the costs of meeting the RFS requirements. Refining companies - like Philadelphia Energy Solutions PESC.N and Monroe Energy, both of Pennsylvania, along with Texas giant Valero Energy Corp (VLO.N) - that do not have adequate facilities to blend biofuels into their products are required to purchase blending credits called RINs from rivals that do. RINs prices have surged this year.  The source said talks on Wednesday could center on solutions like a price cap for RINs or waivers to certain refiners that are at risk of going bankrupt without relief. The governors of both Texas and Pennsylvania have already formally requested such waivers from the administration. The industry has requested tweaks to the policy in the past that would cut the annual volume targets for biofuels, allow ethanol exports to be counted against those targets, or shift the blending burden to supply terminals from refiners. But the Trump administration has ruled in favor of Big Corn and against the refining industry in a series of decisions this year.  Last month, the Environmental Protection Agency, the regulator which administers the RFS, slightly increased biofuels volumes targets for 2018. The refining industry has also been seeking a longer-term overhaul of the RFS before it expires in 2022, but such a change would require an act of Congress and has met with stiff resistance from the corn lobby. The RFS was introduced more than a decade ago by President George W. Bush as a way to boost U.S. agriculture, slash energy imports and cut emissions, and it has since fostered a market for ethanol amounting to 15 billion gallons a year. ",Real
"U.S. has lost trust in South Sudan, Trump envoy tells president JUBA (Reuters) - The United States has lost trust in South Sudanâ€™s government for fueling the countryâ€™s civil war and it must bring peace or risk losing support from Washington, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told the nationâ€™s President Salva Kiir.  Haley was the first senior member of President Donald Trumpâ€™s administration to visit South Sudan, which spiraled into civil war in 2013, just two years after gaining independence from Sudan. She met one on one with Kiir for some 45 minutes.  â€œI let him know that the United States was at a crossroads and that every decision going forward was going to be based on his actions,â€ Haley told reporters after the meeting in the capital Juba. The United Nations has warned that the violence in South Sudan, which has forced some 4 million people to flee their homes, was providing â€œfertile groundâ€ for a genocide. Kiirâ€™s government has denied U.N. allegations of ethnic cleansing. Haley had to cut short a visit to a camp for South Sudanese displaced by the violence amid rowdy anti-Kiir protests.  â€œHe understood that Americans were disappointed in his leadership in South Sudan, I made that very clear. And he understood that all the aid or help that he hopes will go forward is not a given,â€ she said.  Haley did not elaborate on what further action Washington could take, but said that Kiir â€œgot what I was trying to say.â€ On Monday she said Washington was considering how to pressure Kiir into peace, though noted that withdrawing aid may not work. The Trump administration last month imposed sanctions on two senior South Sudanese officials and the former army chief. â€œWe have lost trust in the government and we now need to regain that trust and the only way to regain that trust is through the actions of taking care of all of the people,â€ Haley told South Sudanâ€™s Eye Radio. She demanded that Kiir allow full and consistent humanitarian aid access and bring peace and stability to the country. She said she pushed a timeline for Kiir to act, but declined to elaborate.  Nhial Deng Nihal, a senior adviser to Kiir, said the president told Haley his government and a U.N. peacekeeping mission in South Sudan had established â€œmechanisms that work jointly to improve and address the humanitarian problems.â€ He also told reporters that Kiir said government troops â€œwill also be observing a cessation of hostilities in order to create an atmosphere for dialogue.â€ The civil war was sparked by a feud between Kiir, a Dinka, and his former deputy Riek Machar, a Nuer. It has plunged parts of the worldâ€™s youngest nation into famine. A fragile peace deal broke down last year and Machar fled the country. He is being held in South Africa to stop him stirring up trouble, sources told Reuters in December.  Haley had to cut short a visit to a camp in Juba, where U.N. peacekeepers are protecting some 30,000 displaced people, after hundreds of rowdy pro-Machar protesters blocked nearby roads, yelling â€œSalva Kiir is a killerâ€ and â€œWelcome USA.â€ Protesters held a large sign that read â€œSouth Sudan IDPs (internally displaced people) and refugees love President Trump, the peacemaker and supporter of human rights.â€  A spokeswoman for the U.N. mission said the protest â€œstarted to gain momentum after (Haley) left, IDPs became upset that she was not able to meet with them.â€ Haley was meeting with a displaced family when she had to leave early due to security concerns.  The previous U.S. administrations of President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama were heavily involved in the birth of South Sudan, which signed a peace accord with Sudan in 2005 and gained independence in 2011. ",Real
"Medicaid, pension costs create budget complications for U.S. states: report NEW YORK (Reuters) - A sluggish forecast for U.S. economic growth as well as an increase in U.S. statesâ€™ Medicaid and pension contribution costs is creating a budgetary squeeze in many state capitols, according to a research report issued by S&P Global Ratings on Monday.  While the risk of a recession within the next 12 months has fallen into a 15-20 percent range from 20-25 percent, the rate of economic expansion â€œis expected to remain fairly anemic at 1.8 percent over the longer term (roughly 10 years), well below the 3.0 percent average growth rate that prevailed from 1980 to 2000,â€ the report said. â€œAnd while the risk that federal policy could trigger a recession has eased, the potential for a dramatic scaling-back of federal aid for Medicaid has never been greater,â€ the report said. The slow-growth economy is producing sluggish revenue trends for the states, said Gabriel Petek, an analyst at S&P, in a telephone interview.  S&P does not expect Washington will enact a federally funded public infrastructure package in the next two years, which will put further stresses on state budget management. Addressing deferred maintenance and inadequate capacity in public infrastructure will depend heavily on state and local government solutions, the report said. Without a possible bump in growth from a federal infrastructure package, projected GDP growth for 2017 was lowered to 2.2 percent from 2.3 percent, the report said. â€œAnything that is done at the federal level would imply that more of the burden has to be picked up by the state and local government level in the area of infrastructure investment,â€ Petek said. The report added that the U.S. mid-Atlantic region (New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania) will have the slowest growing economy compared to other regions. Real GDP growth for the region is projected at 1.25 percent for 2017, the report said. The best performing region forecast for the current year, with an economic growth forecast of 2.88 percent is the Mountain region (Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming). Overall, regional economies growth rates are expected to peak in 2018 before some of those gains ebb, the reportâ€™s data showed. The best performing region forecast for 2018 are the states in the West South Central region (Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas) with a combined growth rate of 3.36 percent, followed closely by the Mountain region at 3.29 percent and Pacific region at 2.93 percent.

" Corrupt Republican Blames â€˜Deep Stateâ€™ For His Arrest After Stealing Charity Money Something strange happens when the President sees conspiracies everywhere: they tend to bleed into the rest of the government, at least the Republican government. Now, a crooked former GOP Congressman, who s best known for inviting Ted Nugent to President Obama s State of the Union speech, is blaming a Trump-touted conspiracy for the fact the he allegedly stole money for his campaign and personal use and got caught.Former Texas Rep. Steve Stockman blamed the  deep state  on his alleged campaign finance crimes, for which he was arrested. This is part of a deep state that s continuing to progress,  he said after a hearing. Stockman cited a right-wing conspiracy theory that the IRS targeted conservative groups.Stockman is being charged with diverting money from a charitable organization called Life Without Limits to his political campaign and for personal use. Beginning shortly after the $350,000 charitable donation was deposited into his Life Without Limits account, rather than spending the money on the  Freedom House,  Stockman secretly diverted the funds to pay for a variety of personal expenses and to fund illegal contributions to Stockman s campaigns for public office,  court documents filed with the criminal complaint stated.Source: RollcallSince Trump has taken office, we ve seen a lot about the supposed deep state. The deep state is, according to the Oxford Dictionary,  A body of people, typically influential members of government agencies or the military, believed to be involved in the secret manipulation or control of government policy.  Before Trump s election, the term was generally only used by fringe conspiracy theorists and white supremacists who accuse Jewish people of running a shadow government. Now, though, the head of the deep state could be Jewish, but he could also be Barack Obama. Conspiracy theories are fluid like that.Of course, Stockman has a history with the IRS. During the non-scandal scandal that involved the IRS daring to verify the veracity of non-profit statuses (from both sides of the aisle), he called for the arrest of IRS head at the time, Lois Lerner. It s looking more and more like his only reason for wanting Lerner s arrest was to prevent his arrest.Stockman has been released on bond and his main defense is that he stole only $15,000, not $350,000.Featured image via Gage Skidmore/Flickr",Fake
" Conservative â€˜Christianâ€™ Leader Defends Pedophile GOP Candidate Roy Moore It didn t take long for conservative  Christians  to jump to the defense of Roy Moore.Not long after the Washington Post published a story containing detailed accusations from several women who claim that Moore sexually assaulted and abused them as teens, conservatives disgustingly continued to back him despite having the opposite reaction to allegations against several high profile Hollywood actors and producers.And that s not to mention the reaction conservatives had when right-wing websites pushed a conspiracy claiming that Hillary Clinton ran a sex trafficking operation inside a pizza restaurant, a conspiracy that was immediately and thoroughly debunked.Conservatives STILL believe that conspiracy, but refuse to believe the very real victims who have come forward about Moore.Rather than call for Moore to step aside, conservative  Christians  are more rabid than ever, and that includes Jerry Falwell Jr., who along with the rest of his anti-gay friends still supports Moore just like they continued to support Donald Trump despite Trump saying on tape that he likes to grab women by their genitals without their consent. It comes down to a question who is more credible in the eyes of the voters   the candidate or the accuser,  Falwell said.  The same thing happened to President Trump a few weeks before his election last year except it was several women making allegations. He denied that any of them were true and the American people believed him and elected him the 45th president of the United States. And I believe the judge is telling the truth. So Falwell Jr. is making Moore s guilt contingent on whether voters elect him or not. In other words, he s telling Republican voters that electing him is the equivalent of a jury verdict of  not guilty. But that s not how the justice system works. And it s not how we should be judging political candidates.It should be pointed out that the race in Alabama has turned into a dead heat according to a poll taken after the bombshell story dropped, so clearly voters must not think Moore is very credible.These are credible allegations that should be taken seriously. Seriously enough that Moore should be forced to withdraw his candidacy. The fact that conservatives are using the Bible to defend sexual abuse and assault proves that they are nothing more than fake Christians. They would support a pedophile rather than vote for a Democrat. That s how far conservative  Christians  have fallen. They are literally supporting a man who claimed that homosexuality causes pedophilia, the same man who is being accused of predatory sexual behavior involving a 14-year-old girl. Only Moore is a straight white  Christian  so conservatives think his pedophilia is acceptable.Hillary Clinton was right. These people are deplorable.Featured Image: Scott Olson/Getty Images",Fake

"Man says he delivered manure to Mnuchin to protest new U.S. tax law  (In Dec. 25 story, in second paragraph, corrects name of Strongâ€™s employer to Mental Health Department, not Public Health Department.) By Bernie Woodall (Reuters) - A man claiming to be the person who delivered a gift-wrapped package of horse manure at the Los Angeles home of U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Monday he did it to protest the federal tax overhaul signed into law last week by President Donald Trump. Robert Strong, 45, a psychologist for the Los Angeles County Mental Health Department, said by telephone he left the poop-filled parcel addressed to Mnuchin and Trump in the driveway outside Mnuchinâ€™s home in the posh Bel Air community.  KNBC-TV, an NBC television affiliate in Los Angeles, reported Mnuchin was not home at the time. The package was found by Mnuchinâ€™s neighbor.    â€œProtest really should be funny,â€ Strong told Reuters. â€œPeopleâ€™s eyes glaze over when they just see angry people in the streets.â€ He believes the new tax law will hurt poor people. Neither the U.S. Secret Service nor the Los Angeles Police Department, both of which investigated the incident, would confirm Strong was responsible. The Secret Service interviewed an individual who admitted delivering the package, but no charges had been filed against him as of Monday afternoon. LAPD Lieutenant Rob Weise said it was possible whoever left the package did not break any criminal laws. While he is not assigned to investigate the incident, Weise said if the box did not present any danger, it would not be illegal. The LAPD bomb squad X-rayed the box before opening it on Saturday. In a photo of the card Strong posted on Twitter, he wrote â€œMisters Mnuchin & Trump, Weâ€™re returning the â€˜giftâ€™ of the Christmas tax billâ€ and signed it â€œWarmest wishes, The American people.â€      Strong said a Secret Service agent, accompanied by six police officers, showed up at his house to question him on Sunday night, and the agent chided him, asking, â€œâ€˜Are you ashamed of your behavior?â€™â€     The White House declined to comment on Monday and officials with the Treasury Department could not be reached.

"Families of Japanese abducted by North Korea meet Trump, but want action TOKYO (Reuters) - Family members of Japanese abducted by North Korea met U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday and welcomed his sympathy for their â€œvery sadâ€ plight, but said it meant nothing unless it led to action to bring home their loved ones. Trump has incorporated into his attacks on Pyongyang the story of Megumi Yokota, 13 when she was snatched off a lonely beach by North Korean agents 40 years ago, mentioning her in a September speech at the United Nations. For his part, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has said he will not rest until the return of all 13 of those Pyongyang says were kidnapped in the 1970s and 1980s to train spies, making the issue a keystone of his political career.

Furthermore, just 26 percent of Republican respondents said that the debate changed their opinion of Trump for the better.

" Trump Threatens To â€˜Change Libel Lawsâ€™ To Sue People Who Criticize Him In Twitter Meltdown Here s another hole in the leaky ship that is the argument Trump shouldn t be taken  literally  when he makes threats. Trump has circled back to his campaign promise to make changes to libel laws that would allow him to go after journalists and news organizations which publish things he doesn t like.

I m going to open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money. We re going to open up those libel laws.

"Trump Hotels talking to about 10 new franchisees for midscale brand NEW YORK (Reuters) - (In this July 27 story, paragraph 5 corrects to say midscale brands have been announced over the past year and a half. In paragraph 12 corrects description of IHG brand to Holiday Inn Express from Holiday Inn; corrects to say new brand would aim to capture part of $20 billion market rather than to generate $20 billion in revenues on its own) Trump Hotels, diversifying from a longtime focus on the luxury market, has about 10 hotels in the pipeline for its recently announced midscale American Idea chain, Chief Executive Eric Danziger said in an interview with Reuters. The new chain, the product of conversations last year between President Donald Trumpâ€™s sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump about the lack of options in the midscale market, will be franchised and thus not directly operated by Trump Hotels, unlike most of the companyâ€™s other properties. When closely held Trump Hotels, which is part of the Trump Organization, announced the brand last month, it said it had struck a deal with Chawla Pointe, LLC, to open three of the properties in Mississippi. If the further â€œ10 or soâ€ properties come to fruition, the deals would thrust Trump Hotels into the midscale market at a time when other hotel companies are extending their range in that area. Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc (HLT.N) and Intercontinental Hotels Group Plc (IHG.L) have announced new midscale brands over the past year and a half.      â€œGenerally that midscale product is all the same with a different name on it,â€ Danziger said in a phone interview this week, adding that American Idea would differentiate itself with a decor he described as â€œflea market chic,â€ with decor and design tailored to local industries and landmarks.    Danziger said most American Idea hotels would be conversions from other brands, with the first expected to open in early 2018. Advertising is set to begin next month, he said. Danziger declined to provide further details about the potential new American Idea locations, saying the deals had not been finalized, but said the negotiations were with owners from different parts of the country. Trump Hotels, whose best-known properties are luxury hotels in major cities like New York, Chicago, Washington and Las Vegas, earlier this year unveiled a third brand, Scion, which has lower prices than the traditional Trump hotels and is aimed at millennials.

" Dulles Airport ERUPTS As Detained Family Reunites After Trumpâ€™s Muslim Ban (VIDEO) Donald Trump s Muslim ban was one of the main focal points in his presidential campaign, but no one imagined that he d actually follow through with it so quickly after officially becoming President.Trump s first week in office was marked by several inhumane executive orders, one of which involved banning refugees from seven predominately Muslim countries. As a result, on Saturday travelers to the U.S. were humiliated and detained for up to 12 hours at airports across the country, receiving word that they could not come into America as their relatives waited anxiously to hear what would happen. It is a disgusting ordeal to put a family through, and signifies the breakdown of the U.S. Constitution under Trump s administration.Fortunately, people like Trump are not the majority. In response to this disgusting ban, thousands of protesters gathered at airports around the country to fight for the rights of the citizens being detained. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and volunteer lawyers got to work, offering their services pro bono to aide the detainees, and last night America finally saw its first win against Trump s tyranny.Brooklyn Federal Judge Ann Donnelly slapped the law down on Trump and was able to enact a nationwide temporary emergency block to Trump s Muslim ban, relieving these families and citizens from their anguish. ACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero responded to the ruling: Clearly the judge understood the possibility for irreparable harm to hundreds of immigrants and lawful visitors to this country. Our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court. If you want to see just how monumental this was, you don t have to look any further than the outpouring of emotion that happened at Dulles Airport in North Virginia, after the Federal Judge granted travelers stay. In a crowd of over 1,000 people, a family reunited for the first time after authorities detained a woman due to Trump s Muslim ban. You can watch the powerful moment below:Amazing, emotional scenes here at Dulles as some passengers finally unite with crying relatives surrounded by protestors welcoming them. pic.twitter.com/h8sW3LR75N  (((YousefMunayyer))) (@YousefMunayyer) January 29, 2017We must never forget that what Trump is doing is not only cruel and ruining people s lives, but it is unconstitutional.

" Hillary Reveals The ONE Person Who Made Her Loseâ€¦ And It Isnâ€™t Trump Hillary Clinton is speaking up after her election loss and coming forward with the facts on what contributed to the results. Despite the mainstream media s claims to the contrary, she points the finger at the extraordinary decision by FBI Director James Comey to interfere in the middle of the race. Just as we were back up on the upward trajectory, the second letter from Comey essentially doing what we knew it would saying there was no there there was a real motivator for Trump s voters,  Clinton said. Essentially, the second Comey letter played right into Trump s hands by giving new suspicions to those who believed the Washington establishment was helping Clinton win and pushed a surge in turnout.  Trump spent the last four days of this campaign engaged in a nonstop attack on me personally, and the result is the result,  Clinton said.The former presidential candidate also said she is  concerned  and  deeply saddened  for those who say they are living in fear in the United States after Trump s election.The decision by Comey was blasted by Democrats, and even some Republicans, as it gave the appearance that Clinton was still involved in wrongdoing, even though she had been previously cleared. It also fed into the mainstream media s obsession with Clinton s emails, which they covered more than nearly any other issue during the election.By contrast, Trump s refusal to release his tax returns hardly merited coverage, by comparison, nor did the shady dealings of his personal charity, the Trump Foundation.The press, in concert with the FBI and the right wing, weighed in on the election all against one candidate. While the right makes claims about  liberal media  bias, it is clear time and time again that they are weighing in on the behalf of the Republican side of the aisle and not the other.Featured image via Flickr",Fake
" Congressional Black Caucus Condemns Trump: Heâ€™s A Racist Who Cozies Up To White Supremacists Democratic members of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) condemned Donald Trump and his unbelievably tone-deaf attempt at African-American  outreach,  slamming him as a racist who has spent his entire campaign cozying up to white supremacists.The CBC convened a conference call on Tuesday to denounce Trump, and accused his campaign of not only perpetuating stereotypes but also deliberately dog whistling to white supremacists in an effort to turn their bigotry into votes.Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.) said that the Republican nominee is  one of the most racist, sexist and bigoted candidates  to launch a bid for the White House in modern history, and accused Trump of having a  kinship with white supremacists. He knows the audience he s trying to reach out to and it s not African-Americans,  Meeks said.  He s trying to appeal to David Duke and the racists of the world with what they think are stereotypes.   He s trying to appeal to the worst of the white supremacists and others he s been catering to in the campaign to try and help them with turnout. In the past few days, Trump has attempted to pander to minority voters but has done an exceedingly poor job of it. In an effort to garner votes from African-Americans he claimed that their communities are  war zones  and that they live in fear of being shot at any moment. Trump s big selling point was that since black Americans live in poverty, have poor education, and a lack of job opportunities they might as well vote for him. After all, it isn t like they have anything to lose, right?Trump s blatant racism and p*ss poor excuse for minority outreach aren t going over well with African-American voters or lawmakers.CBC Chairman G.K. Butterfield (D-N.C.) blasted Trump for giving speeches supposedly meant to draw black voters to crowds that are overwhelmingly white and said that the GOP nominee s so-called outreach is  a slap in the face  to the African-American community. If Donald Trump truly cared about African-Americans, he d disavow his long history of hateful and racist attacks against our community, he d apologize for having discriminated against black families   he d disavow his support for white supremacists and white supremacy,  Butterfield said.The Democrats taking part in Tuesday s call ripped Trump s past history of discriminatory housing practices during his years as a real estate investor and his habit of exploiting minority workers as a builder.They noted that his campaign has been littered with bigotry from the very beginning when he announced his candidacy by calling all Mexicans  rapists.  Since then, he has been reluctant to disavow the Ku Klux Klan and David Duke, called for all Muslims to be banned from entering the United States, accused a judge of being incapable of impartiality because of his Mexican heritage, and has refused to believe that President Obama was born in America.In response to Trump and his racist rhetoric, Democrats say they are pushing their minority voter registration efforts into overdrive and plan to set records with black and Hispanic turnout at the polls in November. To say that minority voters are eager to cast their ballots for Hillary Clinton to make sure that Trump never gets anywhere near the White House would be an understatement. Donald Trump is a voter registration machine and a citizenship-advocating engine,  said Rep. Luis Guti rrez (D-Ill.).  This is a little bit of thank you, because our community has never been so united or energized since that moment you set foot in national arena. Trump has said repeatedly that he will do great with African-Americans and Hispanics. It is hard to know what in the world ever gave him that idea, but his  outreach  isn t helping his cause and surely won t convince minority voters to turn a blind eye to the fact that he has built his entire campaign on bigotry.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",Fake
" Legal Community SCHOOLS Trumpâ€™s Lawyer For Claiming Collusion Is Not A Crime Donald Trump s attorney Jay Sekulow made a fool of himself on Tuesday morning.During an interview with ABC host George Stephanopoulos, Sekulow actually claimed that collusion is not a crime in an effort to defend Trump after his associate George Papadopoulos plead guilty to lying to FBI agents about meeting with Russians. He was a volunteer with the campaign, he served on one of the committees,  Sekelow said.  He was involved with individuals that purported to be somehow involved with Russia or Russian government   it s not clear from the documents. The end result is the meeting doesn t take place. So what you had is you had all this conversation about collusion. Remember this, collusion in and of itself   there s no crime of collusion. Even Stephanopoulos knew that claim was bullshit. Collusion is cooperation and that s what he was doing with Russians,  Stephanopoulos replied.Here s the video via YouTube.Indeed, collusion is just another word for  conspiracy,  which is a crime. A MAJOR crime.Sekulow s claim was immediately debunked by prominent members of the legal community.Harvard University law professor John Coates and University of California, Irvine law professor Rick Hasen schooled Sekulow. It is a federal crime to conspire with anyone, including a foreign government, to  deprive another of the intangible right of honest services,  Coates told Politifact after Fox News host Eric Bolling made the same claim in July.  That would include fixing a fraudulent election, in my view, within the plain meaning of the statute. If others participated in the scheme to do this it could be a conspiracy,  Hasen added.  Whether you want to call that  collusion  or not seems besides the point. In short, Trump s own attorney doesn t understand the law and apparently thinks that the use of the word  collusion  absolves Trump and his campaign team of any crimes. But that s simply not the case and any self-respecting judge would laugh at Sekulow in open court if he tried to use such a defense.Featured Image: Win McNamee/Getty Images",Fake

" Bernie Drops STUNNING Truth Bomb On Trump Voter, Makes Her Regret Vote In Under 2 Minutes (VIDEO) Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders knows that most Trump supporters voted out of fear and anger rather than actual policy or facts   and he found a way to perfectly expose this truth on national television for all to see. During an MSNBC town hall in Kenosha, Wisconsin (aka  Trump Country ), Sanders confronted Trump voter Gail Sparks about her inaccurate views on what Trump actually stood for.Sparks admitted that she hadn t voted in 2012, but got herself to the polls for Trump this year because she wanted change. She connected with his fear mongering about undocumented immigrants   she even called them  those people  and accused them of stealing jobs and being the reason she made less money. But when Sparks brought up the social safety net, Sanders couldn t take it anymore and had to stop her in her tracks to give her the facts. Sparks said: Who s paying for this? Who s paying for the Medicaid? Who s paying for the Social Security? Who s paying for the Medicare? Now, have any of you seen down on the streets that it seems as though we have become the silent minority and not the majority? MSNBC host Chris Hayes asked Sparks who she was talking about and Sparks responded, The people who need the Medicare, the people who need the Social Security, who need the help with the education. That s when Sanders respectfully decided to prove to her that she d made the wrong choice when she voted. Sanders said: Good point. Let s see if we can go forward on this. I am assuming that you believe, correct me if I m wrong, that we should not cut Social Security or Medicare or Medicaid. Is that correct or not? Sanders let Sparks agree that the social safety net shouldn t be cut before dropping an epic truth bomb. He continued: Do you know who is now working very hard to try to do that? Republicans in Congress have a plan under the guise of saving Medicare and saving Social Security, making devastating cuts. That s what the Republicans are now trying to do. As Sanders went on, a look of shock, disappointment and embarrassment washed across Sparks  face   but Sanders didn t stop: The other point that you made is, who is going to pay for this stuff? And that is a very fair point. What all of us should know is that over the last 25 years, there has been a massive transfer of wealth in this country from you to the top one-tenth of one percent. In other words, the middle class has shrunk and trillions of dollars have gone to the top one-tenth of one percent. Do you think it s inappropriate to start asking those people to pay their fair share of taxes so we can adequately fund Medicaid and make public colleges and universities tuition-free. Is that an unfair thing to ask? Sparks took a second to digest what Sanders was saying and replied, I don t think it s an unfair thing to ask. They got rich off of us, so it s time they put back. Sanders said,  Okay, that s what I m saying. This conversation between Sparks and Sanders proves that a lot of Trump supporters have no idea what Trump and the GOP are actually doing, and they re just as unclear on Trump s policies as he is.

" Trump Jr.â€™s Latest Move Proves That Russia Investigation Is Closing In On Trump (DETAILS) Proving that the biggest obstacle to his presidency is always going to be himself and his equally incompetent team and family, Donald Trump s Russia investigation has been blown wide open thanks to his idiot son, Donald Trump Jr.Unlike his brother, Eric, Trump Jr. takes after his father in having an equally offensive Twitter habit. Recently, Trump Jr. admitted that he d met with a Russian lawyer during his father s presidential campaign, putting him at the center of Trump s latest Russia controversy.Following the backlash and political consequences, Trump Jr. has now gotten himself a criminal defense lawyer, despite the fact that the Trump administration desperately tried to shrug his confession off as nothing. Trump Jr. s latest move proves that it was anything but. According to Reuters: Donald Trump Jr., the president s son, has hired New York lawyer Alan Futerfas to represent him in connection with Russia-related investigations, the lawyer and Trump Jr. s office said on Monday. Futerfas, a sole practitioner who specializes in criminal defense, would not say when he was retained or whether he had any input into the statements Trump Jr. made over the weekend about a meeting with a Russian lawyer. Just like with his father, legal experts are weighing in on what might happen to Trump Jr., and there are several who believe that Trump s son might actually find himself behind bars for violating federal laws.Trump Jr. s moronic confession is just the tip of the iceberg as far as evidence of Trump s collusion with Russia. No one should ignore that Trump Jr. s hiring of a criminal defense attorney is big news   because if Chelsea Clinton had done this, the GOP would scream and shout for Hillary s impeachment.Trump s administration is busy 24/7 trying to fix the ever-growing Russia scandal.

"Highlights: The Trump presidency on March 22 at 6:30 P.M.

The main investigative panel of the House of Representatives has asked the White House and the FBI for documents regarding former national security adviser Michael Flynnâ€™s foreign contacts with Russia, Turkey and others, its Republican chairman and Democratic counterpart say. Trump and Republican congressional leaders appear to be losing the battle to gather enough support in the House of Representatives to pass their Obamacare rollback bill, watched by wary investors in financial markets. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, speaking at a meeting of countries fighting Islamic State, says the United States will set up â€œinterim zones of stabilityâ€ to help refugees return home in the next phase of the fight against Islamic State and al Qaeda. U.S.-led coalition aircraft drops fighters for the first time into an area near the Syrian city of Raqqa to retake territory from Islamic State in a mission that includes artillery and special operations troops. Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch says presidents must obey court orders and expresses uncertainty about language in the Constitution barring U.S. government officials from taking payments from a foreign country as Democrats grill him on issues involving Trump. Labor Secretary nominee R. Alexander Acosta tells a Senate committee he will abide by Trumpâ€™s directive to review a pending â€œfiduciary ruleâ€ for retirement investment advisers, indicating he believed it goes too far. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will meet with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to discuss the administrationâ€™s proposed budget, the panelâ€™s chairman says, after heated opposition in Congress to Trumpâ€™s plan to slash funding for diplomacy and foreign aid.

"CEOs of Target, ADM offer differing views on U.S. border tax at hearing WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chief executive officers of two major American companies - retailer Target Corp and agribusiness Archer Daniels Midland Co - offered opposing views in a hearing before U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday on a proposed border adjustment tax. Target CEO Brian Cornell has been one of the most vocal opponents of the Republican-backed border adjustment tax and testified alongside Juan Luciano, president and CEO of ADM, who spoke in favor of the proposal. The border tax would imposes a tax on imports while providing a credit for exports and has been proposed by House Republicans as part of a larger tax code overhaul. Target is a big importer of goods, while ADM exports. House Speaker Paul Ryan argues the proposed border tax, which is estimated to garner $1 trillion, will not affect prices and will allow rate cuts for businesses while not creating deficits, but retailers warn that it could raise consumer prices as much as 15 percent.  Cornell and Luciano took staunchly different positions on the tax.  â€œUnder the new border adjustment tax, American families â€“ your constituents â€“ would pay more so many multinational corporations can pay even less,â€ Cornell told the committee.  Luciano, on the other hand, argued that the tax would make American companies more competitive. â€œA competitive tax code will help us continue providing American-made food and feed to our customers in the United States and abroad in the face of robust and, from a tax perspective, ever strengthening competition from abroad,â€ he said. The outlook for passage of the border tax - which drew staunch opposition from retailers - remains perilous, especially as key Senate Republicans and President Donald Trump have refused to endorse it. Several Republican members of the committee expressed concerns about the tax during the hearing that stretched more than three hours, including Republican Representative Jim Renacci who argued the proposal could hurt small businesses that rely on imports. Dimming the prospects more, lawmakers and lobbyists have begun to speculate that Congress will be unable to rally support for a sweeping tax code overhaul this year, and are beginning to look instead at cutting tax rates without broad reform. The committee heard from two additional supporters of the tax, including William Simon, the former CEO of Wal-Mart Stores Inc, who despite his past with a large retailer that opposes the tax, endorsed the measure. â€œWe will see more good middle class jobs, a robust U.S. economy and an era of growth that will be led by a new industrial revolution,â€ Simon said. Lawrence Lindsey, the former director of the National Economic Council under President George W. Bush, also supported the tax. Economist Kimberly Clausing, of Reed College, criticized the proposal, saying she disagrees with the argument by proponents that currency markets would prevent consumer prices from increasing.  â€œThis is an untested tax reform that is not ready for primetime,â€ she said.

" Neil DeGrasse Tyson Gets Uncharacteristically Political; Says Trump Is A â€˜Threat To Democracyâ€™ (VIDEO) Neil DeGrasse Tyson has always put science before politics, sometimes frustratingly so. Right after Trump was elected, Tyson appeared on Stephen Colbert s show, and rather than opine, he chose to try to comfort the host by saying that when you look at earth from outer space, our problems dissolve. He also said: The politician is representing an electorate. So, really, if you re against a politician, you re against their voter base, fellow citizens of this country,  he said.  So I as an educator, when I want to educate people, I don t say,  Don t vote for this person  or  Vote for that person.  I just simply educate you, so that when the time comes, you can make as informed a decision as you can. Now, though, Tyson is changing his tone. The Trump administration is clearly anti-science and it s anti-education. For Dr. Tyson, it s time to speak out   right before protesters across the nation are prepared to march for science. He posted this video to Facebook on Friday: Science is a fundamental part of the country that we are,  Tyson said.  When you have people who don t know much about science standing in denial of it and rising to power, that is a recipe for the complete dismantling of our informed democracy. While Tyson was clearly talking about Donald Trump, anti-GMO anti-vaxxer (often) liberals were taken to task as well.Tyson didn t deny that science has a place in politics. Once we agree, for example, that humans are causing climate change, we can debate how to fix the problem, but until we agree that there is a problem, we re screwed.Donald Trump s name wasn t mentioned at all during the four-minute video, and it didn t need to be.

"Vermont governor snuffs legal pot, tells lawmakers to 'get it right' (Reuters) - Vermontâ€™s governor on Wednesday halted, at least temporarily, efforts to become the ninth state to legalize the recreational use of marijuana, but offered to work with state legislators to resolve what he cited as the billâ€™s shortcomings.  In vetoing the measure to decriminalize possession of small amounts of the drug for adults and to pave the way for a regulated market in the state, Republican Governor Phil Scott stressed he was not philosophically opposed to the concept, which he said he views â€œthrough a libertarian lens.â€ But in an effort to â€œget it right,â€ he said the bill needs to improve protections for children and motorists. â€œI want to reiterate that we can all work together on this issue in a thoughtful and responsible way,â€ the governor said at his weekly news conference in Montpelier. Scott said the bill should â€œmake clearâ€ that there will be no change in current penalties for giving or selling the drug to minors under 21 or near schools, and it should have stiffer penalties for smoking marijuana while driving or in front of children. The Marijuana Regulatory Commission the bill would create needs to include police, health and tax collecting representatives, and should be responsible for coming up with impairment limits for drivers, testing mechanisms, and education and prevention programs for minors, he added. â€œIf the legislature agrees to make the changes I am seeking, we can move this discussion forward in a way that ensures the public health and safety of our communities and our children continues to come first,â€ said Scott. The Marijuana Policy Project, a pro-legalization group, said it was disappointed, but held out hope that the governor and legislators would reach a compromise. â€œMost Vermonters want to end marijuana prohibition, and it is critical that the legislature respond by passing a revised legalization bill this summer,â€ said Matt Simon, the groupâ€™s New England political director.      The bill, which won the approval of the stateâ€™s House of Representatives 79-66 and the state Senate 20-9, both of which are controlled by Democrats, would have made Vermont the first state to legalize recreational marijuana legislatively, instead of by popular referendum. Of the eight states and the District of Columbia that have legalized recreational marijuana, two - Massachusetts and Maine - are nearby, while Canada, to Vermontâ€™s north, is considering legalization. Marijuana remains illegal under U.S. federal law.      ",Real

"'Dreamer' immigration bill not on U.S. Senate agenda this month WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate will not consider an immigration bill as part of year-end legislation but will turn to a measure protecting immigrant youths known as â€œDreamersâ€ in January, No. 2 Senate Republican John Cornyn said on Monday. Cornyn also said that if Congress cannot meet an early March deadline for passing legislation providing the protections against deportation for undocumented immigrants who were brought illegally into the United States as children, President Donald Trump could consider extending the deadline. In interviews over the past several days, both Republican and Democratic lawmakers and aides said that talks on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) have been quietly making progress. â€œThe president has given us enough time to deal with this before March and so I think thatâ€™s plenty of time and I expect us to meet it,â€ Cornyn told reporters. â€œIf we canâ€™t, then the president could extend the deadline if he chose to do so. But this is something weâ€™re going to turn to, Iâ€™m sure, in January.â€ Tensions between Republicans and Democrats over the issue of legislative protections for Dreamers increased this fall after Trump took a hard line on the conditions for a deal. An intense lobbying campaign has been underway to urge lawmakers to find a permanent legislative fix after the Republican president ended the DACA program in September. He gave Congress until early March to come up with a legislative replacement. On Capitol Hill, advocates have handed out buttons to lawmakers and aides with the number â€œ122,â€ referring to the estimated number of Dreamers each day who already are losing the temporary legal status they had under DACA. Immigration advocates have erected a huge monitor on the National Mall. Situated at the base of the U.S. Capitol for lawmakers and tourists alike to see, it broadcasts videos of Dreamers pleading for help. Meanwhile, seven DACA beneficiaries from Mexico, Argentina and Colombia were in the fourth day of a hunger strike to draw attention to the issue. Republican Representative John Carter, a veteran of past immigration debates, said he worried Democrats want to go way beyond the scope of DACA and the approximately 800,000 Dreamers who at one time or another were covered by Democratic former President Barack Obamaâ€™s executive order. â€œTheyâ€™re talking Dream Act,â€ Carter said referring to the legislation offered by Democratic Senator Dick Durbin and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham. â€œAnd that number is about 2 million people. Thatâ€™s too much.â€ Past legislative attempts to allow Dreamers to get work permits and drivers licenses, open bank accounts and â€œcome out of the shadowsâ€ have stalled as conservative Republicans and lobbying groups objected to giving â€œamnestyâ€ to anyone who entered the United States illegally - even those who had no choice in the matter and have grown up here. Democratic Representative Michelle Lujan Grisham, who chairs the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said Republican demands for additional resources for immigration enforcement throughout the United States and not just at the border are a major problem. Her concern is that the Trump administration might use the money to hire more federal agents to nab undocumented relatives of Dreamers. â€œIf youâ€™re going to come in and go to hospitals and go to courtrooms and go to schoolsâ€ in search of family members, â€œIâ€™m not going to do that,â€ she said in an interview.

" Meryl Streep Just HAMMERED Trump In Heartbreaking Human Rights Speech (VIDEO) We can expect another angry, weeks-long tantrum from Donald Trump after Meryl Streep s speech at the Human Right s Campaign s 2017 Greater New York Gala Dinner on Saturday. Suddenly, at one point in the 20th century, for reasons I can t possibly enumerate in my two remaining minutes, the clouds parted. Something changed,  Streep said, speaking of the advances in civil rights we have made in recent history.  For the first time in 39,999 years, women began to be regarded as, if not equal, at least deserving of equal rights. Men and women of color demanded their equal rights. People of sexual orientation and gender identification outside the status quo also demanded equal regard under the law.  But then she turned her eye toward an orange, thin-skinned coward who threatens to undo decades and decades or work: Which brings us to now. We should not be surprised that fundamentalists, of every stripe, are exercised, and fuming. We should not be surprised that these profound changes come at a steeper cost than we originally though. If we live through this precarious moment- if his catastrophic instinct to retaliate doesn t lead us to nuclear winter, we will have much to thank our current leader for. He will have woken us up to how fragile freedom is. The whip of the executive, through a Twitter feed, can lash and intimidate, punish and humiliate, delegitimize the press and imagined enemies with spasmodic regularity and easily provoked predictability,  she told the crowd.Streep recently sent Trump into a rage fit after her speech at the 2017 Golden Globes when she went for Trump s throat over his decision to mock a disabled reporter s condition: This instinct to humiliate, when it s modeled by someone in the public platform, by someone powerful, it filters down into everybody s life, because it kinda gives permission for other people to do the same thing. Disrespect invites disrespect, violence incites violence. And when the powerful use their position to bully others, we all lose. Trump has been very stressed lately with his Muslim ban dying in multiple courts and all. We can probably expect The Donald to cheer himself up by attacking Streep again, which he seems to think is his job.

"Pence hires his own lawyer for Russia probes WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence has hired a lawyer known for defending government officials in high-profile investigations to help him with probes into whether there were ties between the election campaign of U.S. President Donald Trump and Russia, his office said on Thursday. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Moscow interfered in last yearâ€™s presidential campaign to try to tilt the vote in Trumpâ€™s favor. Trump, who hired his own lawyer last month for probes by a special counsel and congressional committees, lashed out on Thursday after a report that he was under investigation for possible obstruction of justice. He dismissed as â€œphonyâ€ the idea that his campaign colluded with any Russian effort to sway the 2016 election. Moscow denies meddling in the campaign. Pence hired Richard Cullen, chairman of law firm McGuireWoods, to help him respond to inquiries from special counsel Robert Mueller, a spokesman said. Cullen is a former federal prosecutor who has long ties to former FBI Director James Comey, whom Trump fired on May 9. He represents former FIFA President Sepp Blatter in the corruption probe into world soccerâ€™s governing body. U.S. prosecutors have not accused Blatter of wrongdoing. Cullen, who supported Trumpâ€™s rival Jeb Bush during the race for the Republican presidential nomination, also represented Tom DeLay, a Texas Republican and former majority leader of the U.S. House of Representatives, during the investigation into corrupt Washington lobbyist Jack Abramoff. DeLay was not charged. Pence had been looking at hiring his own counsel for several weeks, and made his decision earlier this week after interviewing several candidates, his office said. â€œThe vice president is focused entirely on his duties and promoting the presidentâ€™s agenda and looks forward to a swift conclusion of this matter,â€ Pence spokesman, Jarrod Agen, said in a statement. Pence has seldom addressed the Russia issue, which has overshadowed Trumpâ€™s efforts to overhaul the healthcare system, cut taxes and boost jobs - priorities that Pence has worked on intensively with Republican lawmakers. The Washington Post first reported the Cullen hire. Just before the story broke, Trump wrote a pair of angry tweets, suggesting that Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent in the election, should be under investigation instead of him. Earlier on Thursday, Trump called the probe a â€œwitch huntâ€ on Twitter. â€œThey made up a phony collusion with the Russians story, found zero proof, so now they go for obstruction of justice on the phony story. Nice,â€ Trump wrote. Mueller is investigating whether anyone on Trumpâ€™s campaign, or associated with it, with him or any of his businesses, may have had any illegal dealings with Russian officials or others with ties to the Kremlin, said one U.S. official familiar with the rough outlines of the probe and who spoke on condition of anonymity. That includes the finances and business dealings of Jared Kushner, who is married to Trumpâ€™s daughter Ivanka, and is a senior adviser at the White House, the Washington Post reported on Thursday, citing unnamed officials familiar with the matter. Mueller is also looking at a second line of inquiry: whether, if any potential offenses were committed, Trump or others attempted to cover them up or obstruct the investigation into them, the source said. An examination of possible obstruction of justice charges was â€œunavoidableâ€ given testimony by Comey, although the issue may not become the main focus of the probe, the source said. Comey told a Senate panel last week he believed Trump fired him to undermine the FBIâ€™s Russia probe. He also told the Senate Intelligence Committee in his June 8 testimony that he believed Trump had directed him to drop a related agency investigation into the presidentâ€™s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn. White House officials, including Pence, initially gave differing reasons for Comeyâ€™s dismissal, including that he had lost the confidence of the FBI. Pence said on Twitter on May 10 that Trump had â€œmade the right decision at the right time to remove Comey as the head of the FBIâ€ and praised him for showing â€œstrong & decisive leadership to restore trust & confidence of the American people in the FBI.â€ Trump later contradicted his own staff, saying on May 11 he had the Russia issue in mind when he fired Comey. Examining the possibility of obstruction charges will allow investigators to interview key administration figures including Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and possibly Trump himself, said the source familiar with the Mueller investigation. While a sitting president is unlikely to face criminal prosecution, obstruction of justice could form the basis for impeachment. Any such step would face a steep hurdle as it would require approval by the U.S. House of Representatives, which is controlled by Trumpâ€™s fellow Republicans. ",Real
" Top Republicans TRASH Trumpâ€™s Immigration Proposal, GOP In Pieces (TWEET) Donald Trump has successfully torn the Republican Party (and America) apart. His policies have not only divided Americans across the country, but even members of his own party are at odds with their president s policies.One thing that is shattering the GOP is the growing opposition to Trump s immigration agenda. During Trump s campaign and budding presidency, Trump was touting a border wall and mass deportations. Now that Trump has announced somewhat more concrete plans, some high profile Republicans are publicly voicing their disappointment.One of the most outspoken GOPers going up against Trump is South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, who is warning Trump that his merit-based immigration plan would be a  disaster  for states like South Carolina. Graham said in a statement: After dealing with this issue for more than a decade, I know that when you restrict legal labor to employers it incentivizes cheating. Here s Trump announcing his merit-based system, called the RAISE Act:I campaigned on creating a merit-based immigration system that protects U.S. workers & taxpayers. Watch: https://t.co/lv3ScSKnF6 #RAISEAct pic.twitter.com/zCFK5OfYnB  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 2, 2017Since Trump announced the RAISE Act on Tuesday, it has been opposed by several Democratic lawmakers and several Republicans like Graham. These lawmakers are arguing that Trump s proposed plan puts the service industry  in peril.  Graham explained: South Carolina s number one industry is agriculture and tourism is number two. If this proposal were to become law, it would be devastating to our state s economy which relies on this immigrant workforce. South Carolina s agriculture and tourism industry advertise for American workers and want to fill open positions with American workers. Unfortunately, many of these advertised positions go unfilled. Hotels, restaurants, golf courses and farmers will tell you this proposal to cut legal immigration in half would put their business in peril. Another South Carolina Republican, Tim Scott, also opposed Trump s plans. Scott stated that America needed to fix  our broken illegal immigration problem  but also wanted the country  to encourage the legal process  due to its positive effects on the labor force. Senate Republican Conference Chairman John Thune had similar concerns about the labor workforce. He said: If we get on immigration, there will be a lot of different perspectives on that  We have workforce needs, and some of those are filled by the immigrant labor supply. Unfortunately, this is likely going to fall on deaf ears, considering that the current POTUS was ignorant enough to say in his campaign announcement, When Mexico sends its people, they aren t sending their best.  Trump has been anti-immigration from the start, and he clearly doesn t care if the way he goes about it sucks.Featured image is a screenshot",Fake
"Gorka, a Trump adviser and Bannon ally, is out: White House WASHINGTON (Reuters) - White House adviser Sebastian Gorka, who was closely aligned with a nationalist faction led by ousted senior strategist Steve Bannon, no longer works for President Donald Trump, the White House said on Friday. â€œSebastian Gorka did not resign, but I can confirm he no longer works at the White House,â€ a White House official said in a statement. The official did not elaborate, but the statement suggested that Gorka had been fired. Gorka had reportedly feuded with national security adviser General H.R. McMaster and was unhappy with the decision Trump announced this week - backed by McMaster and the U.S. military - to reorient U.S. policy in Afghanistan. Gorka, who frequently appeared on cable news shows to tout Trumpâ€™s policies, was a divisive figure within the  administration, seen by veteran intelligence professionals and diplomats as an ideologue with little real-world experience. He is the latest in a string of hawkish or nationalist advisers to leave the National Security Council and other parts of the White House in recent weeks, suggesting that in the battle among Trumpâ€™s foreign policy advisers, internationalist voices such as those of McMaster, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson are prevailing. Earlier, the conservative Federalist news outlet, citing multiple sources familiar with the situation, said Gorka, a counterterrorism expert, had quit. In a letter of resignation, Gorka expressed dissatisfaction with the current state of the Trump administration, the Federalist said. â€œAs a result, the best and most effective way I can support you, Mr. President, is from outside the Peopleâ€™s House,â€ Gorka was quoted as saying in the letter.  Trump fired Bannon a week ago in the latest White House shake-up, removing a far-right architect of his 2016 election victory and a driving force behind his nationalist and anti-globalization agenda. â€œRegrettably, outside of yourself, the individuals who most embodied and represented the policies that will â€˜Make America Great Again,â€™ have been internally countered, systematically removed, or undermined in recent months. This was made patently obvious as I read the text of your speech on Afghanistan this week,â€ he said in the letter. A U.S. citizen born in Britain with Hungarian parents, Gorka worked as national security editor at Bannonâ€™s Breitbart news website, where he often warned of Islamic terrorism. ",Real
"Facebook says likely Russian-based operation funded U.S. ads with political message SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc said on Wednesday it had found that an operation likely based in Russia spent $100,000 on thousands of U.S. ads promoting divisive social and political messages in a two-year-period through May. Facebook, the dominant social media network, said 3,000 ads and 470 â€œinauthenticâ€ accounts and pages spread polarizing views on topics including immigration, race and gay rights. Another $50,000 was spent on 2,200 â€œpotentially politically relatedâ€ ads, likely by Russians, Facebook said.  U.S. election law bars foreign nationals and foreign entities from spending money to expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate. Non-U.S. citizens may generally advertise on issues. Other ads, such as those that mention a candidate but do not call for the candidateâ€™s election or defeat, fall into what lawyers have called a legal gray area.  Facebook announced the findings in a blog post by its chief security officer, Alex Stamos, and said that it was cooperating with federal inquiries into influence operations during the 2016 U.S. presidential election.  Facebook briefed members of both the Senate and House of Representatives intelligence committees on Wednesday about the suspected Russia advertising, according to a congressional source familiar with the matter. Both committees are conducting probes into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, including potential collusion between the campaign of President Donald Trump and Moscow. Facebook also gave its findings to Robert Mueller, the special counsel in charge of investigating alleged Russian interference in last yearâ€™s presidential election, a source familiar with the matter said. The company produced copies of advertisements as well as data about the buyers, the source said. Muellerâ€™s office declined to comment. Facebook said it found no link between the Russian-purchased advertising and any specific presidential campaign. The ads were mostly national in their focus and did not appear to reflect targeting of political swing-states, the company said. Even if no laws were violated, Facebook said the 470 accounts and pages associated with the ads ran afoul of the social networkâ€™s requirements for authenticity and have since been suspended.  Facebook did not print the names of any of the suspended pages, but some of them included such words as â€œrefugeeâ€ and â€œpatriot.â€  More than $1 billion was spent on political ads during the 2016 presidential campaign, thousands of times more than the presumed Russian spending identified by Facebookâ€™s security team. But the findings buttress U.S. intelligence agency conclusions that Russia was actively involved in shaping the election. Facebook previously published a white paper on influence operations, including what it said were fake â€œamplifierâ€ accounts for propaganda, and said it was cracking down. As recently as June, Facebook told journalists that it had not found any evidence of Russian operatives buying election-related ads on its platform. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, called the Facebook report â€œdeeply disturbing and yet fully consistent with the unclassified assessment of the intelligence community.â€ â€œWe are keenly interested in Russiaâ€™s use of social media platforms, both the use of bots and trolls to spread disinformation and propaganda, including through the use of paid online advertising,â€ he said in a statement. A Facebook employee said Wednesday that there were unspecified connections between the divisive issue ads and a well-known Russian â€œtroll factoryâ€ in St. Petersburg that publishes comments on social media. Ellen Weintraub, a member of the U.S. Federal Election Commission, said U.S. voters deserve to know where the ads are coming from and that the money behind them is legal. â€œIt is unlawful for foreign nationals to be spending money in connection with any federal, state or local election, directly or indirectly,â€ Weintraub said in a phone interview.  She declined to comment on the Facebook ads, saying she could not discuss subjects that could come before the agency. Facebook declined to release the ads themselves, prompting a sharp rebuke on Twitter from Pierre Omidyar, the billionaire founder of First Look Media, a producer of feature and documentary films, television and podcasts. â€œFacebook keeps the targeted political ads it publishes secret, emboldening criminals,â€ wrote Omidyar, the eBay founder who also provided funding to launch media organization The Intercept. â€œI donâ€™t see how that can possibly be legal.â€ Facebookâ€™s disclosure may be the first time a private entity has pointed to receiving Russian money related to U.S. elections, said Brendan Fischer, a program director at the Campaign Legal Center, a Washington nonprofit that advocates for more transparency.  â€œWhoever may have provided assistance to Russia in buying these Facebook ads is very likely in violation of the law,â€ he said, adding that Facebook has a legal duty to act if it is aware of similar activity in the future.

"Illinois House Democrats push tax freeze to end budget impasse CHICAGO (Reuters) - Democrats in Illinoisâ€™ House of Representatives on Monday offered Republicans a four-year freeze on local property taxes that has been a key sticking point in the stateâ€™s historic budget impasse. It was not clear whether the legislation represented a break in the political logjam that has left the countryâ€™s fifth-largest state without a full-year operating budget for two fiscal years and threatens to downgrade its credit rating to junk. Republican Governor Bruce Rauner and the Democrat-led legislature face a Friday deadline to pass a budget or risk the consequences of a third-straight year of fiscal futility, including the halt of state-funded road projects and a suspension from national lottery programs. A committee hearing is set for Tuesday on a bill, filed Monday by a top Democratic ally of House Speaker Michael Madigan, to freeze property taxes for four years through 2020, except for Chicago.  Under state Representative Michael Zalewskiâ€™s plan, debt-service and pension payments would be excluded from the freeze, and cash-strapped school systems that have been placed on a financial watch list by Illinois would be exempt, including Chicagoâ€™s struggling public school system. While Senate Democrats passed a two-year tax freeze last month, Rauner and lawmakers from his party have been pushing for a four-year freeze on property taxes. Madigan told reporters on Monday that a House Democratic spending outline would be made public on Tuesday before a planned meeting of the four legislative leaders, but he declined to offer details. â€œOnce thatâ€™s in place, the question is: â€˜Can we work together to find the revenue to pay for that spending plan?â€™ Thatâ€™s where we come up against Governor Raunerâ€™s demands for an extreme-right agenda,â€ Madigan said. Rauner has also insisted on changes to pensions and the way injured workers are compensated by employers, as well as term limits for certain state officials. Madigan revealed his own demands on Sunday, including a school funding revamp bill already passed both chambers. House Republican Leader Jim Durkin insisted that any tax increase match the duration of a property tax freeze before he would be willing to help secure Republican votes. â€œWeâ€™re looking at four years on both, and nothing more than that,â€ Durkin told reporters at a news conference in the state capital. Raunerâ€™s office directed an inquiry from Reuters to Durkinâ€™s office. A spokesman for Durkin later declined specific comment on Zalewskiâ€™s legislation, saying only it was being reviewed. ",Real
" CNN Host STUNNED As Trumpâ€™s Team REFUSES To Comment On Russian Hacking (VIDEO) Donald Trump s team certainly doesn t make it easy for the people who have to interview them. In a typical interview with Trump s team, news anchors have to constantly fact check and repeatedly bring Trump s minions back to the original questions and topics as they deflect blame and avoid answering every question.On Monday s  New Day,  CNN host Alisyn Camerota had to interview Trump spokesman Sean Spicer, and it was basically an interview from hell as Spicer wouldn t give her any responses to the most pressing questions. Camerota had tried to ask Spicer just what special information Trump claimed he knows about Russia s involvement in the US election. Spicer s response couldn t have been more insane as he said Trump gets a lot of  classified information, intelligence reports  on a daily basis (despite the fact that Trump s team once said the president-elect only gets briefings once per week). Spicer then went off topic and said Trump will wait to make conclusions about the hacking, ignoring the fact that Trump has defended Russia extensively from all blame.Camerota was unwilling to let Spicer avoid the question, and she said: I want to get back to my question. Is Mr. Trump, who said he s going to reveal something, he says he knows things. Spicer again refused to give a response, stating that Trump would talk about it himself right before blaming Obama for not talking about China s 2015 hacking. Camerota responded by fact-checking Spicer right then and there. She said: Sean, just to correct you, you say not a single statement was ever issued or made after the Chinese hacking. I have the statement right here in my hands. Spicer s response was pathetic, as he admitted to being wrong but still continued to blame Obama, accusing Obama of responding too late. Camerota tirelessly tried to bring Spicer back to her question: Sean, I m more interested in what Mr. Trump is going to do. We re not electing President Obama again. You are representing Mr. Trump. Camerota asked about Trump s plans, and Spicer couldn t provide her with anything. All he did was confess that Trump didn t have a final report. Spicer then stunned Camerota by admitting that he had lied earlier when he said Trump had been briefed: The report is not final. He s not been briefed by the heads of the intelligence community. A stunned Camerota said in disbelief,  He has not been briefed about the heads of the intelligence community about whether or not they believe Russia is behind the hacking? Spicer began to fall apart when Camerota told him to  hold on  after he accused anyone who believed  non-final  reports of being irresponsible. Spicer shouted, No! Not, hold on! The idea we re asking people and making assumptions on a report that s not final is unbelievable. The rest of the interview, Camerota was forced to constantly counter Spicer s moronic remarks. Spicer practically ended the interview by completely disrespecting Camerota for expecting that Trump and his team might at least be exploring the possibility that reports about the Russian hacking are correct. Spicer said condescendingly: I know it s frustrating for you that we re doing it in a logical way. No, we re going to get all the information, get briefed properly and make a decision. We re not going to put the cart before the horse. Camerota couldn t believe her ears. You can watch this disastrous interview below:Featured image via screenshot",Fake
"Trump, Macron engage in a little handshake diplomacy BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron barely know each other but they seemed to have a hard time letting go when they first met on Thursday. Each man gripped each otherâ€™s right hand so firmly that their knuckles turned white and their jaws seemed to clench as they sat down for a face-to-face meeting. Images from the photo session at the U.S. ambassadorâ€™s residence in Brussels showed Trump finally giving up, his fingers loosened while Macron is still holding on tightly. Macronâ€™s determination may be a lesson for German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who on a recent visit to the Oval Office tried and failed to get Trump to shake her hand.

"Trump praises Chinese efforts on North Korea 'menace,' Pyongyang warns of strike WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump praised Chinese efforts to rein in â€œthe menace of North Koreaâ€ on Thursday, after North Korean state media warned the United States of a â€œsuper-mighty preemptive strike.â€ Trump told a news conference â€œsome very unusual moves have been made over the last two or three hours,â€ and that he was confident Chinese President Xi Jinping would â€œtry very hardâ€ to pressure Beijingâ€™s ally and neighbor North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs. While Trump gave no indication of what the moves might be, U.S. officials told Reuters that the United States was aware of a higher-than-usual level of activity by Chinese bombers, signaling a possible heightened state of readiness. The officials played down concerns and left open a range of possible reasons. * COMMENTARY: The next super weapon could be biological reut.rs/2oVooHc * COMMENTARY: The worrying lessons of the Syria chemical attack reut.rs/2o6r55r Those possibilities included defensive exercises or Chinese concerns over North Korea. None of the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, suggested alarm or signaled that they knew the precise reason for such Chinese activity.      U.S. officials have been saying for weeks that North Korea could soon stage another nuclear bomb test, something both the United States and China have both warned against. Trump has taken a hard line with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who has proceeded with nuclear and missile programs in defiance of U.N. Security Council sanctions. The United States and South Korea are technically still at war with North Korea because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. Tensions have risen sharply in recent months after North Korea conducted two nuclear weapons tests last year and carried out a steady stream of ballistic missile tests. Trump, who took office in January, has vowed to prevent North Korea from being able to hit the United States with a nuclear missile. Trump has focused his efforts on North Korea on trying to persuade China to put more pressure on its ally and could view any unusual Chinese military movements as supportive of this. He told a news conference with the visiting prime minister of Italy on Thursday that the United States was â€œin very good shapeâ€ on North Korea and that Chinaâ€™s Xi, whom he met this month for a summit in Florida, was working hard to help. â€œWe donâ€™t know whether or not theyâ€™re able to do that, but I have absolute confidence that he will be trying very very hard.â€ Trump repeated a past comment that he had told Xi in Florida that China would make much better deal on trade with the United States â€œif you get rid of this menace or do something about this menace of North Korea.â€ â€˜SUPER-MIGHTY PREEMPTIVE STRIKEâ€™  The Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of North Koreaâ€™s ruling Workersâ€™ Party, struck an aggressive tone earlier on Thursday.  â€œIn the case of our super-mighty preemptive strike being launched, it will completely and immediately wipe out not only U.S. imperialistsâ€™ invasion forces in South Korea and its surrounding areas but the U.S. mainland and reduce them to ashes,â€ it said. Reclusive North Korea regularly threatens to destroy Japan, South Korea and the United States and has shown no let-up in its belligerence after a failed missile test on Sunday, which followed a huge display of missiles at a parade in Pyongyang. South Korean news agency Yonhap quoted an unnamed South Korean government source as saying that the U.S. Air Force had dispatched a nuclear sniffer aircraft on Thursday to the east of the Korean Peninsula in anticipation of a possible nuclear test. The U.S. Defense Department does not comment on deployments of the WC-135 Constant Phoenix aircraft used to collect samples from the atmosphere to detect and analyze nuclear explosions.    The U.N. Security Council on Thursday condemned North Koreaâ€™s latest failed missile test and demanded it not conduct any more nuclear tests. South Koreaâ€™s acting president, Hwang Kyo-ahn, at a meeting with top officials on Thursday, repeatedly called for the military and security ministries to maintain vigilance. The South Korean defense ministry said U.S. and South Korean air forces were conducting an annual training exercise, codenamed Max Thunder, until April 28. North Korea routinely labels such exercises preparations for invasion. â€œWe are conducting a practical and more intensive exercise than ever,â€ South Korean pilot Colonel Lee Bum-chul told reporters. â€œThrough this exercise, I am sure we can deter war and remove our enemyâ€™s intention to provoke us.â€     William Perry, who served as U.S. defense secretary from 1994 to 1997 and negotiated with North Korea, said he did not believe Pyongyang was planning a surprise attack, despite the fiery rhetoric. But he warned: â€œThey are doing a lot of bluster and a lot of threats, and they might misplay that hand and blunder into a war.â€ GRAPHIC: Carl Vinson strike group - tmsnrt.rs/2p1yGTQ GRAPHIC: North Korea's nuclear program -  tmsnrt.rs/2lE5yjF ",Real
"Trump, declining to provide evidence, says thinks Obama adviser Rice committed crime: NYT  ((This story published on April 5th corrects typographical error in paragraph 8)) WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he thinks Susan Rice, a former top adviser to President Barack Obama, committed a crime by seeking the identities of Trump associates mentioned in intercepted communications, but he declined requests for evidence, the New York Times reported. In an interview, Trump declined to tell the New York Times whether he had reviewed intelligence to bolster his claim about Rice but said he would explain himself â€œat the right time.â€ Rice said she had no immediate comment on the presidentâ€™s remarks when contacted by Reuters. Later on Wednesday, Erin Pelton, a spokesman for Rice, said in an email to Reuters: â€œIâ€™m not going to dignify the Presidentâ€™s ludicrous charge with a comment.â€ Trump and his allies have focused on unsubstantiated reports that Rice, who served as Obamaâ€™s national security adviser, disclosed the names of Trump aides swept up in U.S. surveillance of foreign targets. Rice dismissed the reports as â€œabsolutely falseâ€ in an interview with MSNBC on Tuesday. According to five U.S. intelligence officials, Rice followed standard procedure in requesting the National Security Agency to reveal to her the names of American citizens who had been in contact with Russians whose communications were monitored by U.S. intelligence. It is unlikely she would have known that any unidentified American had a connection to Trump, the officials said. As White House national security adviser, Rice could not order the NSA to reveal the identities of any Americans. Instead, she could only request it to do so. Such requests, which a number of senior officials are authorized to make, trigger a legal and intelligence review by the agency to determine whether revealing the name has potential intelligence value and could expose a security threat to the United States, said one of the officials, who is familiar with the process and spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal intelligence procedures. There is nothing unusual, much less suspicious, about any request by Rice, said another intelligence official, especially since it could have revealed Russian intelligence contacts or agents operating in the United States. This official and two other intelligence officials said the NSA often receives dozens of such requests in a month. John Culhane, a professor at Widener University Delaware Law School, said he thought Rice could have a credible libel lawsuit against Trump. Though public figures like Rice face a higher standard in bringing such claims, Culhane said she could contend Trump demonstrated a â€œreckless disregardâ€ for the truth. But the president typically enjoys immunity from civil lawsuits over official acts, Culhane noted, and a court could find that Trumpâ€™s interview with the newspaper was within the scope of his official duties.

"Budget deal may map U.S. Congress road ahead, via Trump bypass WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress, bitterly divided for years along party lines, may be mapping a bipartisan path forward that skirts around President Donald Trump when he refuses to engage constructively with lawmakers, Democrats and some lobbyists said on Monday. The path was discernible in a nearly $1.2 trillion federal spending deal carved out over the weekend to avert a government shutdown. It had Democratic fingerprints all over it, even though Republicans control Congress and the White House.  White House budget director Mick Mulvaney said Trump will sign the 2017 budget bill when he receives it from Congress on Thursday or Friday. Trump, in an interview with Bloomberg on Monday, said he was â€œvery happyâ€ with the deal announced late on Sunday. Democrats claimed victory on issue after issue in the agreement, which will keep the lights on in Washington through the end of  the federal fiscal year on Sept. 30, provided it holds up and wins final approval as expected. Trump scored a partial win, getting a commitment for up to $15 billion in additional funding for a military buildup. That was about half of what he originally asked for. No money was included for Trumpâ€™s proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall. Democratic opposition to it was solid and support from Trumpâ€™s fellow Republicans was soft. Mulvaney said Trump will seek wall funding in a budget proposal coming in late May. At a White House briefing, Mulvaney defended the concessions Trump made to reach an agreement, saying Democrats gave up on some items they had wanted as well in order to find a compromise. â€œEverything we got in this deal ... lines up perfectly with the presidentâ€™s priorities,â€ he said. Democrats took an opposite view. Describing the work on Capitol Hill that went into the temporary spending pact, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told reporters: â€œDemocrats and Republicans in the House and Senate were closer to one another than we were to the president on so many of the different issues.â€ Schumer and Senator Patrick Leahy, the senior Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, said they were bolstered in negotiations by the fact that several Republican senators opposed funding for Trumpâ€™s wall and his call for deep domestic spending cuts. Schumer and Leahy said the White House never tried to work with Democrats in the process. Trump treats engaging with lawmakers on legislation as â€œan afterthought,â€ said Doug Heye, a Republican strategist who worked in Congress as an aide to former House Republican leader Eric Cantor. â€œThe power of the Oval Office can provide a lot of leverage when trying to move something on Capitol Hill,â€ Heye said. â€œWe just havenâ€™t see that level of engagement from Trump, whether itâ€™s healthcare, or building a wall, or tax reform.â€ But John Feehery, a Republican strategist in Washington, said the spending bill may not be indicative of Trumpâ€™s ability to negotiate with Congress because the legislative body should have dealt with this yearâ€™s funding months ago and never have been allowed to go into the current year.  â€œHe knows that this bill was probably not going to reflect his priorities because it was old business,â€ Feehery said. â€œWhen it comes to new business, he has a lot more leverage in getting his priorities accomplished.â€œ The spending deal preserved funding for healthcare provider Planned Parenthood, which has drawn Republican ire because it performs abortions; for the Obamacare healthcare law; and for an array of environmental and other domestic programs Trump wanted to slash. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said because the legislation needs to win a supermajority of 60 votes in the 100-member Senate that cannot be achieved without Democratic support, â€œwe couldnâ€™t have our entire wayâ€ on the deal. Spicer said the â€œpresidentâ€™s priorities will be reflected much moreâ€ in spending yet to be worked out for the 2018 fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1. He said Trump was pleased to see the increase in military spending, a â€œdown paymentâ€ on border security and money for scholarships to help low-income children in Washington attend private schools.     The fiscal 2017 funds, which should have been locked into place seven months ago, would pay for federal programs from airport and border security operations to soldiersâ€™ pay, medical research, foreign aid, space exploration and education. The Pentagon would win a $12.5 billion increase in defense spending for the fiscal year, with the possibility of an additional $2.5 billion contingent on Trump delivering a plan to Congress for defeating the Islamic State militant group. Congressional negotiators settled on $1.5 billion more for border security, including money for new technology and repairing existing infrastructure.  Under the deal, Puerto Rico would get an emergency injection of $295 million for its Medicaid health insurance program for the poor. The impoverished U.S. territory faces a severe Medicaid funding shortfall. The U.S. government and coal companies would be required to pay out healthcare to retired coal miners, guaranteeing benefits to workers even as coal companies face bankruptcy, under the spending agreement. The deal also would reimburse New York City for money spent securing Trump and his family at Trump Tower in Manhattan. ",Real
" WATCH: Don Lemon SCHOOLS Trump Supporter For Calling Trumpâ€™s Win A â€˜Landslideâ€™ Apparently, conservatives do not know what a dictionary is, much less how to read one.In the reality created by conservatives in their narrow minds, facts are lies, lies are facts, and words have different definitions.Donald Trump threw a temper tantrum on Twitter over CNN s coverage of him and actually had the gall to call his election win a  landslide. .@CNN is so embarrassed by their total (100%) support of Hillary Clinton, and yet her loss in a landslide, that they don t know what to do.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 29, 2016During a panel discussion on CNN on Monday, a Trump supporter repeatedly claimed that Donald Trump won the election  by a landslide  even though he got nowhere near the electoral vote totals of President Obama and lost the popular vote by more than 2 million votes to Hillary Clinton.Paris Dennard s ridiculous claim forced CNN host Don Lemon to humiliate him on the air. It s also false for Trump to say that the electoral college vote was a landslide. It was certainly an upset, but it was far from a landslide. You go back to 1980, he had a smaller margin than the Reagan elections, George H. W. Bush, Barack Obama s two elections   he tops only George W. Bush s two narrow wins. Can he call this a landslide? Why is he calling this a landslide? It s not a landslide, he got way more than most people thought, but you can t really call this a landslide. Dennard responded by repeatedly changing the definition of the word  landslide  to mean simply beating Hillary Clinton. But Lemon would have none of it. You re changing the definition of landslide?  Lemon replied.  You can say he did better because he won, but can you call something a landslide when it s not actually a landslide? Is that what you re doing? It wasn t a landslide, Paris. A landslide is only a landslide when it s the definition of a landslide. That s not the definition of a landslide. That s you changing the definition of a landslide. Dennard s ignorance forced Bakari Sellers to burst out in laughter while Kayleigh McEnany could only close her eyes in embarrassment.Here s the video via YouTube.As Lemon pointed out, Donald Trump definitely did NOT win by a landslide. In fact, he may not have even won at all if recounts in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania flip the vote in favor of Hillary Clinton.Featured image via screenshot",Fake

After telling Puerto Ricans whose lives have been devasted by two hurricanes that they are throwing the budget  out of whack,  Trump praised officials on the island with the exception of the Mayor of San Juan, in order to continue his war on Carmen Yul n Cruz.As Trump entered Calvary Chapel, cheers rang out from the crowd, according to The Hill. There were signs in the room which read  Let s Make Puerto Rico Great Again  and  God bless You, Mr. President,  according to a pool report. There are no signs like that visible from the video which captured the former reality show star throwing rolls of paper towels out to the desperate hurricane victims.

At that point, Trump handed out a few packages of rice to the crowd, then picked up packaged rolls of paper towels and threw them into the crowd as if he was practicing shooting basketball hoops.A few of the rolls were caught by people in the crowd while another fell to the ground.Watch:.@realDonaldTrump entrega suministros durante su visita a la isla. #TrumpPuertoRico #hurac nMar a pic.twitter.com/aAsND3HRd6  El Nuevo D a (@ElNuevoDia) October 3, 2017It s as if Trump thought he was starring in a game show.Yes, he really did throw paper towels at the church crowd in PR.

On Wednesday at a Nevada rally, Trump urged the terminally ill to  hang out till November  so they can assist in the destruction of the United States so they can vote for him.

"New Trump communications director promises crackdown on media leaks WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Anthony Scaramucci, President Donald Trumpâ€™s new communications director, said on Sunday that one of his first tasks will be to halt leaks and that staff on his team would be fired if the leaks do not stop. â€œIf we donâ€™t get the leaks stopped, I am a businessperson, and so I will take dramatic action to stop those leaks,â€ Scaramucci said on Fox News Sunday. Scaramucci told CBSâ€™s Face the Nation that leakers are â€œactually un-American,â€ and that he would lead a team meeting on Monday.  The hiring of Scaramucci, a Wall Street financier and Republican fundraiser, brings a combative style to the White House press office as President Donald Trump lashes out at probes into whether his campaign colluded with Russians during the 2016 campaign. Special counsel Robert Mueller is looking into any relationships or contacts between Trump campaign officials and Russia during the election, but Trump has not been accused of any wrongdoing by federal investigators.   White House press secretary Sean Spicer, who became a household name in his short and turbulent drama-filled term, quickly resigned after Scaramucciâ€™s appointment. Sarah Sanders, Spicerâ€™s deputy, was promoted to press secretary. Scaramucci was forced to deal with leaks on his first days on the job after The Washington Post reported last week that Trump and his legal team had examined presidential powers to pardon aides, family members and potentially himself. Trump wrote on Twitter on Saturday that leaks against the administration are a â€œcrimeâ€ and that he has â€œcomplete power to pardon.â€ Scaramucci said Trump only tweeted about the issue of pardons in reaction to the leak. Trump â€œdoesnâ€™t like the fact that he has a two-minute conversation in the Oval Office or in his study and that people are running out and leaking,â€ about the administration examining legal options of pardons, Scaramucci, who reports directly to Trump, said on CBS. â€œThereâ€™s no need for him to pardon anybody,â€ he said.     And Scaramucci, who has at times supported Democrats, spent part of the weekend deleting some of his own past tweets on subjects that run counter to Trump administration policy, such as taking action on climate change. Explaining the deletions, Scaramucci wrote on Twitter that â€œpast views evolved & shouldnâ€™t be a distraction.â€       ",Real
" GOP In CHAOS As Obamacare Vote Goes Down In Flames (DETAILS) The entire Republican Party spent the 2016 campaign season running on a promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare. However, now that they have the House, the Senate, and the White House, they re like a dog who caught a car it s been chasing for years, and they can t agree on what to do.This entire week has been spent with party members bickering amongst themselves, and many members of the GOP House Conference in open revolt against Paul Ryan s repeal and replace bill. In fact, the bill was so terrible and would cost so many people their health coverage, that even Donald Trump wouldn t put his name on it. The White House has openly said not to dub the plan  Trumpcare. Well, it seems that for now, there will be no Obamacare repeal. In fact, there won t even be a vote. House Speaker Paul Ryan has pulled the bill because it seems it became clear Friday afternoon that they would not have the votes to get this mess of a healthcare reform bill past the House, much less past the Senate. Of course, this comes just one day after Trump gave House Republicans an ultimatum: Either hold a vote or there will be no Obamacare repeal on his watch, period.That really should come as no surprise, given Trump s low level of patience, short attention span, and penchant for throwing tantrums. He also reportedly said to those voting  No,  on the bill,  I m gonna come after you.  So, who really knows what will come of the relationship between the White House and Congress after this; after all, it was already just a lukewarm marriage of convenience.Well, we ve given the GOP a chance to govern. They have all three branches of the federal government. And they have instead descended into utter chaos in 60 days flat, have been fielding scandal after scandal, and have gotten nothing done. Time to give it back to the Democrats, because it s clear that the Republicans can t handle it.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",Fake
" Democrats Offer Bill That Would FORCE Trump To Keep One Of His Promises The vast majority of Donald Trump s campaign promises were both unworkable and, well, hateful. His promise to  lock (Hillary Clinton) up,  was as empty as it was unifying for those on the rabid right. It was the same with his promise to build a wall along the Mexican border and his promise to  repeal and replace  Obamacare on day one. Occasionally, though, like a broken clock, Trump occasionally got it right, and now Democrats want him to make good on one such promise.Despite the fact that nearly everything Trump adorns with his name is made elsewhere, one of the cornerstones of his presidential campaigns was to force manufacturers to employ Americans.Republicans are doing everything in their power to ensure that Trump doesn t get to keep this campaign promise. There s a bill in the Senate that would help deliver clean water to Americans and help Flint, Michigan with emergency funding. Originally, there was a  buy American and hire American  provision in the bill. That should be non-controversial, right? Well, Republicans, who seem to stand against absolutely everything that s good and right, stripped that part out of the bill back in December. Now Dems want them to bring it back.Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis) reintroduced the provision to the bill:Dem senator to reintroduce #BuyAmerica legislation @thehill https://t.co/uRuOOH9Bbg  Sen. Tammy Baldwin (@SenatorBaldwin) March 24, 2017 Now is the time for President Trump to decide if he will keep his promises by supporting this legislation, or will he go along to get along with Congressional Republicans who have embraced the status quo and blocked this legislation that puts in place a strong Buy America standard,  said Baldwin, who planned to announce the bill at a Wisconsin foundry that makes manhole covers for cities throughout the United States.  The choice for the Republican establishment in Washington is clear: Do you stand with American manufacturers and workers or do you support spending taxpayer dollars on Chinese and Russian steel for American water infrastructure projects? Source: IB TimesDem senator to reintroduce #BuyAmerica legislation @thehill https://t.co/uRuOOH9Bbg  Sen. Tammy Baldwin (@SenatorBaldwin) March 24, 2017Baldwin s bill deals with the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund, which in the last two decades has delivered nearly $28 billion in financing for more than 12,000 drinking-water projects across the country. Her legislation would mandate that moving forward, the program targets its funding to projects that use only American-made iron and steel.It s unlikely the bill will pass with this provision, but it does put Trump s feet to the fire. If he signs the Republican version (which he almost certainly will), it will be just more evidence that the emperor has no clothes.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images.",Fake

" The Full Details Of Trumpâ€™s FAILED Yemen Raid Will Make You Sick To Your Stomach When Donald Trump was campaigning he said something chilling, something that was widely dismissed as  all bluster : that to deal with terrorism, you have to slaughter their families. The other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families. They care about their lives, don t kid yourself. When they say they don t care about their lives, you have to take out their families,  Trump told Fox and Friends as he promised he would not fight a  very politically correct war. In his very first raid as President, he showed the world that he meant it. The operation was approved over dinner without adequate planning or intelligence (in any sense), and it was a disaster from the very beginning.According to reports from locals, the first person hit was 11-year-old Ahmed Abdelilah Ahmed al Dahab, who heard commotion outside and went to check what was happening. When my son Ahmed saw them, he couldn t tell that they were soldiers because it was dark,  the boy s father says.  He asked them  Who are you?  but the men shot him. He was the first killed. No one thought that marines would descend on our homes to kill us, kill our children and kill our women.  Another member of his family, 12-year-old Nasser, was killed.One woman, Fatim Saleh al Ameri, was shot while trying to flee with her two-year-old son.  We pulled him out from his mother s lap. He was covered in her blood,  said 11-year-old Basil Ahmed Abad al  Zouba, whose 17-year-old brother was killed in Trump s Folly.Abdallah al Ameri, who had years earlier survived a U.S. attack on his wedding party of which he was not the target, was killed along with his 25-year-old daughter Fatima and 38-year-old son Mohammed. Three of Mohammed s children   4-year-old Aisha, 7-year-old Khadija, and 5-year-old Hussein. Another nine members of his family were killed in the raid, including 5-year-old Halima and 6-year-old Mursil. I was woken up after midnight by the bombing of the helicopters. There were soldiers on the ground shooting at us. They started shooting at us with machine gun fire,  witness Fahad Ali al Ameri says of the attack. His three-month-old daughter Asma Fahad Ali al Ameri was killed in her crib, asleep.Also killed was the eight-year-old daughter of an al Qaeda propagandist, American citizen Nawar Anwar Al-Awlaqi, who was hiding in a building at the time.  Some of the gunfire went through the windows and Nawar was injured in her neck,  her uncle, whom she was visiting, says. .  We tried to save her but we couldn t do anything for her. It is true they were targeting al Qaeda but why did they have to kill children and women and elderly people?  said Zabnallah Saif al Ameri, If such slaughter happened in their country, there would be a lot of shouting about human rights. When our children are killed, they are quiet. Trump s raid failed to kill the primary target, Qassim al-Rimi, who is currently taunting  Easy D  in propaganda videos, but did manage to snag three super-important videos that are about a decade old and available on YouTube. The tradeoff for this disaster was about 14 dead militants and 30 noncombatants as well as a member of SEAL Team 6.Because of this disaster, Yemen has withdrawn permission for the United States to conduct anti-terror operations in the country, thus damaging our ability to combat extremism.Naturally, Trump called this massive boner a  success.

"U.S. Justice Dept official should not review AT&T/Time Warner deal: senator WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren on Thursday urged the Justice Departmentâ€™s top antitrust official to recuse himself from an ongoing review of AT&T Incâ€™s planned $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc. She urged Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust Makan Delrahim, who was confirmed late last month, not to take part in the review because of his previous statement that the merger did not pose a â€œmajor antitrust problem.â€  â€œYour refusal to recuse yourself will undermine public confidence in the divisionâ€™s ability to reach an unbiased final decision in the matter,â€ Warren wrote in the letter.

Time Warnerâ€™s stable of content includes the premium cable channel HBO, TNT and news channel CNN, among others. AT&T said last month it plans to reinvest more advertising revenue into content as it goes head-to-head with online streaming services such as Netflix Inc.

" BREAKING: Megyn Kelly Just Gave The Ultimate â€˜F**k Youâ€™ To Fox News, And It Could Destroy The Network It seems that Fox News  repeated decisions to shower of Donald Trump with adoration and excuses has gotten to now-former Fox News host Megyn Kelly. That s right  now former. According to the New York Times, Kelly will be jumping ship to NBC where she will hist a daytime news and discussion program, anchor her own weekend show, and be a part of the network s special political coverage.This may or may not come as a shock to Fox, whose ousted former chairman Roger Ailes sexually harassed Kelly for about a decade, but perhaps they might be having some  hindsight  issues surrounding their recent decision to side with Trump over Kelly when The Donald was bullying her on social media, regular media, and everywhere else imaginable after she challenged him during a debate.Whatever her reason for leaving, she is passing up a pretty sweet $20 million a year that Fox offered her to stay after her current contract expires. NBC has been crystal clear that they can not and will not match that money. Sources declined to tell the New York Times what, exactly, Kelly s annual salary will be, but she is almost assuredly taking a pay cut based on past remarks.While it is entertaining to see Kelly  stick it to  Fox News, we have no choice but to wonder why NBC would hire someone who thinks that Santa and Jesus are both real (and white dudes), who blamed Sandra Bland for her own death, who thinks that pepper spray is a  food product, essentially,  and who has done and said so many horrific things over the years that a truly functional society would treat her as a pariah   though, of course, she was one of the few right-wing voices who actually stood up to Donald Trump to some degree.Naturally, Trump fans are celebrating the news:Megyn Kelly is moving to NBC!

"U.S. nuclear arsenal to cost $1.2 trillion over next 30 years: CBO (Reuters) - Modernizing and maintaining the U.S. nuclear arsenal over the next 30 years will cost more than $1.2 trillion, according to a report released on Tuesday by the Congressional Budget Office. The report said current plans for the modernization of the aging planes, ships and missile silos that make up the U.S. nuclear arsenal would cost 50 percent more than if the U.S. only operated and maintained its current equipment in the field. The CBO study reviewed the Obamaâ€™s Administrationâ€™s plans for modernization of the nuclear arsenal. President Donald Trump in January directed Secretary of Defense James Mattis to conduct his own review the U.S. nuclear forces. The results could be published in the coming months.  U.S. House Armed Services Committee member Adam Smith, a Democrat from Washington, said of the Obama-era plan: â€œCongress still doesnâ€™t seem to have any answers as to how we will pay for this effort, or what the trade-offs with other national security efforts will be.â€  The report said costs would rise from $29Â billion in 2017 to $47Â billion in 2027, before peaking at around $50Â billion a year through the early 2030s. Trump has said he wants to ensure the U.S. nuclear arsenal is at the â€œtop of the pack,â€ saying the United States has fallen behind in its weapons capacity. U.S. officials have noted that Americaâ€™s nuclear modernization is lagging behind Russiaâ€™s upgrade of its own nuclear triad. General Paul Selva, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Congress in August he believed Moscow was already two-thirds of the way through its nuclear modernization process. In August, the U.S. Air Force awarded Boeing Co and Northrop Grumman Corp separate contracts to continue development work on the replacement of the aging Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile system one leg of the nuclear triad.  Days later the Air Force awarded Lockheed Martin Corp and Raytheon Co separate $900 million contracts to continue work on a replacement for the AGM-86B air-launched nuclear cruise missile. That detailed development contract allows the companies to continue work on the long range standoff weapon yet another leg of the triad. ",Real
" Thanks To Capitalism, It Just Got A Lot Harder For Trump Supporters To Attend Inauguration Just like with every presidential inauguration year, Washington, D.C. will become complete chaos during the week of the ceremony. Trump supporters, though, might find it a lot more difficult to find places to stay, though. Users of Airbnb, the housing share site, are pulling their listings because they don t want Trumpsters staying in their homes.Most in the country expected that it would be Hillary Clinton who would be inaugurated on January 20th, so the town was pretty well booked with Democrats. Unfortunately, the mostly blue city was slapped with a dose of Electoral College reality and those reservations are being cancelled in droves, but the people who were set to make bank by renting out their homes aren t necessarily putting the listings back up, at least not for the inauguration. I have a visceral reaction to the thought of having a Trump supporter in my house,  said one host, who was planning on renting one of three of her bedrooms to an inauguration guest.  No amount of money could make me change my mind. It s about moral principles. Another host, identifying herself as  Meredith,  told the Huffington Post that she was concerned about what Trump supporters would do to her condo, particularly to the  priceless  works of art she d collected on her international travels.  We don t trust Trump supporters to stay in our place,  Meredith said though she did note that she didn t mind overcharging (or  gouging ) Trump-loving guests as punishment for their support, if the opportunity presented itself.Yet another, Ellie, said she was  feeling afraid  of  the white men  who might want to rent a bedroom in her home. She noted that she needed the money, however, and would just have to  look past our differences and happily welcome them. Source: Heat StreetTrump supporters, naturally, are flipping out, calling the Airbnb hosts hypocrites and noting that the left wouldn t put up with the same being done to gay people or people of color. They seriously misunderstand the law, though. Yes, it s illegal to discriminate based on race, gender, and in D.C., sexual orientation, but political affiliation is not a protected class and it wouldn t matter if it was. Airbnb hosts aren t discriminating. They re taking their homes off the market. Even Democrats who are protesting Trump s inauguration wouldn t be able to rent them.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",Fake

"Ivanka Trump says world should boost women in cutting-edge industries TOKYO (Reuters) - Ivanka Trump, U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s daughter and informal adviser, told a summit in Tokyo on Friday that the world must boost women and minority participation in the fields of science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM). Ivanka Trump, seen as an important influence on her father, has made womenâ€™s issues one of her signature policy areas since beginning her role at the White House. Her comments came ahead of her fatherâ€™s trip to Asia - his first since taking office in January - that begins in Japan on Sunday. â€œFemale and minority participation in STEM fields is moving in the wrong direction,â€ she said at the World Assembly for Women summit. â€œWe must create equal participation in these traditionally male-dominated sectors of our economy.â€  She said her fatherâ€™s tax reforms - unveiled by Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday - would benefit American families. â€œWe are seeking to simplify the tax code, lower rates, expand the child tax credit, eliminate the marriage penalty, and put more money back in the pockets of hard-working Americans,â€ she told a meeting room in a Tokyo hotel that had a number of empty seats. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said his government was aiming to mobilize women in Japanâ€™s workforce and boost economic growth, launching policies such as improved childcare in his â€œWomenomicsâ€ program. â€œWeâ€™ve put our full strength into creating an environment where itâ€™s easy for women to work,â€ Abe said in an opening address to the conference. â€œI really feel that Japan has come a long way,â€ he said.  Japanâ€™s gender gap remains wide despite such efforts, with little progress made since Abe vowed at the United Nations in 2013 to create â€œa society where women can shineâ€. Japan ranked 114 out of 144 in the World Economic Forumâ€™s 2017 Global Gender Gap report - sandwiched between Guinea and Ethiopia and down 13 places since Abe took power. Abe appointed only two women to ministerial posts in a Cabinet reshuffle in August, down from three and five respectively in his previous two cabinets. Only 14 percent of Japanâ€™s lawmakers are women. Men also dominate decision-making in business in Japan. Only 3.7 percent of Japanese-listed company executives were women at the end of July, according to the Cabinet Office, barely changed from 3.4 percent a year earlier.

" Paul LePage Claims Election Will Be Rigged In Maine, Gets HUMILIATED By Secretary Of State It sounds like Paul LePage just claimed that he was elected twice via a rigged system.Because that s the only real way he can honestly declare that Maine is already in the bag for Hillary Clinton.But that s exactly what the Tea Party Maine Governor said during a phone interview with WVOM radio this week in defense of his buddy Donald Trump.The Republican nominee has been desperately trying to convince everyone that the only reason he is losing in the polls and will lose on November 8th is because the media and Hillary Clinton s campaign are rigging the election against him.And Lepage, whose own constituents in Maine are calling for him to resign, believes him. I am not confident that we are going to have a clean election in Maine,  LePage said.  Will people from the cemetery be voting? Yes, all around the country. The media and the Democratic Party want everybody to vote, whether they re citizens or not. LePage also said that he doesn t  think the elections in the state of Maine or the United States are legitimate  unless voter ID laws are in place everywhere.Those are pretty strong declarations. There s just one large problem. If Maine elections are  rigged  by Democrats, how the hell did Paul LePage win in 2010?It s a good question, and one that Maine Secretary of State Michael Dunlap posed in an email to the Bangor Daily News. Maine has a proud history of full access for voters to participate in our elections,  Dunlap wrote.  It s curious that the governor would question the integrity of a system under which he was elected twice. Indeed, not only has Paul LePage won in his state twice, he did so the first time when Democrats controlled the entire state government. Democrat John Baldacci served as governor from 2003 to 2011, including during the 2010 Election that somehow swept LePage into office. In addition, Democrat Michael Dunlap was also Secretary of State at the time. Furthermore, Democrats had control of the statehouse as they had for four decades. So really, if Democrats had been in the business of rigging elections, LePage would not be in office right now. He would have lost his race in 2010.The fact is that voter fraud is incredibly rare in this country.According to the Washington Post, a comprehensive study found that out of one billion votes cast between 2000 and 2014, only 31 cases of voter fraud were found.In other words, America does not have rigged elections. So like Trump, Paul LePage would be better off shutting his big mouth.Featured Image: Cagle",Fake

"California university system sues Trump over roll back of 'dreamers' program (Reuters) - A former top security official who helped put in place a program protecting people brought to the United States illegally as children, is suing the Trump White House as head of the University of California system over plans to roll back the policy. Janet Napolitano, the former U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security under President Barack Obama, said in a lawsuit filed on Friday that ended the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival program, or DACA, violates the due process of about 800,000 beneficiaries, known as â€œdreamers,â€ who were granted permits that protected them from deportation. â€œThe University has constitutionally-protected interests in the multiple educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body,â€ the lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Northern California said. â€œIf these students leave the University before completing their education, UC will lose the benefits it derives from their contributions, as well as the value of the time and money it invested in these students.â€ The lawsuit also argues Trump did not follow the proper procedures needed to cancel a program of this magnitude. California has more DACA recipients than any other state, many are in their 20s and are current students.  â€œTheyâ€™ve grown up here, theyâ€™ve gotten their educations here, many of them donâ€™t even speak the language of the country to which they would be deported if this decision were allowed to stand,â€ Napolitano said on a call with reporters. The legal challenge comes on top of a separate lawsuit filed earlier in the week by 16 Democratic Attorneys General saying the presidentâ€™s decision to end the program was based in part on racial animus towards Mexicans, who are the largest beneficiaries. Department of Justice spokesman Devin Oâ€™Malley gave the same comment about Napolitanoâ€™s lawsuit as he did in response to the lawsuit by the states. Attorney General Jeff Sessions in announcing his decision to end the program said it was â€œinconsistent with the Constitutionâ€™s separation of powers.â€ Obama enacted DACA through an executive action implemented by the Department of Homeland Security after Congress failed to pass legislation. â€œWhile the plaintiffs in todayâ€™s lawsuit may believe that an arbitrary circumvention of Congress is lawful, the Department of Justice looks forward to defending this Administrationâ€™s position,â€ Oâ€™Malley said in a statement. Trump, who delayed the end of the program until March 5, shifted responsibility to a Congress controlled by his fellow Republicans, saying it was now up to lawmakers to pass immigration legislation that could address the fate of those protected by DACA. Trumpâ€™s move was criticized by business and religious leaders, mayors, governors, Democratic lawmakers, unions and civil liberties advocates.  Legal experts have said that court challenges to Trumpâ€™s actions could face an uphill battle, since the president typically has wide authority when it comes to implementing immigration policy.

"Factbox: Ex-FBI Director Mueller draws praise as special counsel on Russia probe WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Members of the U.S. Congress on Wednesday generally approved of the appointment of former FBI director Robert Mueller as special counsel to investigate possible connections between President Donald Trumpâ€™s 2016 campaign team and Russia. Committees in the House and the Senate will continue their own investigations while Mueller leads the Justice Departmentâ€™s probe. Muellerâ€™s appointment comes after the administration was rocked by reports that Trump asked Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey to drop an investigation of Mike Flynn, who resigned amid allegations of contacts with Russia. Trump fired Comey last week. Below are reactions to the Mueller appointment: â€œAs I have stated many times, a thorough investigation will confirm what we already know - there was no collusion between my campaign and any foreign entity.Â I look forward to this matter concluding quickly.â€ - Trump in a statement â€œA special prosecutor is the first step but it cannot be the last. Director Mueller will still be in the chain of command under the Trump-appointed leadership of the Justice Department. He cannot take the place of a truly independent, outside commission that is completely free from the Trump administrationâ€™s meddling.â€ - Democratic Representative Nancy Pelosi in a statement â€œI donâ€™t think they should have appointed someone ... Where is the actual crime that they think they need a special prosecutor to prosecute? ... What I worry is Democrats are going to politically exploit this on a daily drumbeat.â€ - Republican Representative Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House Oversight Committee investigating Russian influence, in a Fox News interview in which he also praised Muellerâ€™s â€œimpeccable credentials.â€ â€œI think the president ought to now back off and let the justice system proceed as it proceeds in all cases. I think tweeting about the process of the investigation is not helpful and again, I think if he has done nothing wrong there will be no problem.â€ - Democratic Representative Elijah Cummings to reporters â€œThis had gotten too political. Any news comes out, those on the left yell impeach, some on the right say itâ€™s fake. So this hopefully detoxes some of the politics.â€  - Republican Representative Adam Kinzinger to reporters â€œItâ€™s fine but thereâ€™s absolutely no need for it...In Watergate, there was a crime. In the (Monica) Lewinsky case, there was a crime. Thereâ€™s no crime here.â€ - Republican Representative Peter King to Politico â€œHopefully, he (Mueller) will be seen as someone that both Democrats and Republicans can support. I think itâ€™s a prudent move. And it certainly means that the administration is taking it seriously.â€ - Republican Representative Mark Meadows to reporters â€œThis must only be a first step. No doubt this investigation should extend to the circumstances that led to the presidentâ€™s abrupt dismissal of James Comey and to other critical matters that arise.â€ - Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy â€œI would hope that the people here (in Congress) will believe if a special prosecutor tells them that thereâ€™s no indication that the Russians have done anything here, that they will finally open their eyes, and say, â€˜Thereâ€™s no there, there.â€™â€ - Republican Representative Dana Rohrabacher to Reuters â€œThe appointment of former FBI director and respected lawyer Robert Mueller ... is a positive development and will provide some certainty for the American people that the investigation will proceed fairly and free of political influence.â€ - Republican Richard Burr and Democrat Mark Warner, leading members of the Senate committee investigating Russian influence, in a statement ",Real
" Even Trumpâ€™s Homeland Security Chief Thinks Heâ€™s Full Of Sh*t About The Border Wall While campaigning, Donald Trump vowed to build a  great wall  and Mexico will pay for it.  I will build a great wall   and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me   and I ll build them very inexpensively,  the former reality show star said at the time.  I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.  Well, that s not going to happen. Mexico is not paying for the wall and Trump s own homeland security secretary disagrees with the amateur president.Kelly said Wednesday that it is doubtful that a wall along the full border with Mexico would ever be built, despite Trump s claims. It is unlikely that we will build a wall from sea to shining sea,  Kelly told senators on the Homeland Security Committee, according to The New York Times.Instead, Kelly, who was appointed by Trump said the department will look to build physical barriers. That includes fencing and concrete walls in places that make sense.Like his presidency and administration, Trump s plan for the  great wall  is amateurish and chaotic.In February, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), a border-state Republican, said that building a physical wall along the border in some places  makes no sense. There are other Republicans who were left scratching their heads, too, over Trump s nonsensical border wall.  I don t think we re just going to be able to solve border security with a physical barrier because people can come under, around it and through it,  Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) said in January.Still yet, Kelly defended Trump s  extreme vetting  proposal in which he insists that children would not be routinely separated from their families unless the  situation at the time requires it,  such as when the mother is sick or addicted to drugs. Right, because if a mother is sick, her children should be taken from her, amirite?It s not just elected officials who are wondering what the hell Trump is thinking. A supporter of the alleged president s found her home suddenly on the Mexico side of the border. We call that karma. Adding to that, Trump wants a 30-foot wall that looks good on the northern side of the border. We re not sure what she was thinking when she cast her vote for Trump. He was very clear in what he said, and as far as his lies go, she was warned by Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton and Trump s Republican rivals that he s full of sh*t.Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",Fake
" In STUNNING Admission, John McCain Just Handed Democrats The Senate (AUDIO) If Republicans want to lose Congress, there s one surefire way: let Americans know that they will be in for at least two more years of gridlock and obstruction if they win. John McCain, in a stunning admission, promised exactly that.In a radio interview on Philadelphia s 1210 WPHT radio on Monday, McCain wasn t able to say with certainty that Donald Trump would be better at nominating Supreme Court justices than Hillary Clinton would be, but he does promise that if Clinton wins, there s no way the Senate will ever vote on one of her Supreme Court nominees.Later in the interview, McCain used the opportunity to make the case for fellow Republican Sen. Pat Toomey, who is locked in a close battle to retain his Senate seat in Pennsylvania. McCain promised that Republicans would be  united against any Supreme Court nominee  put forth by Clinton. I promise you that we will be united against any Supreme Court nominee that Hillary Clinton, if she were president, would put up,  McCain said.  I promise you. This is where we need the majority and Pat Toomey is probably as articulate and effective on the floor of the Senate as anyone I have encountered. Source: CNNHere s the audio:Voters won t buy it. While McCain s seat is pretty safe, the Senate as a whole is not. Republicans have to win at least 21 seats to retain their majority in the Senate. Democrats only need 15. It s not just that, either. Voters know that it s Congress, not President Obama, who is responsible for the gridlock in Washington, and they are sick of it. Most Americans want the Senate to give Obama s Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, a hearing and ultimately, an up or down vote. Instead, McCain and Republicans are promising more of the same, which is absolutely nothing. Trust me, Americans will punish them at the polls, especially as Donald Trump s campaign continues its downward spiral.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images.",Fake
" One Of Trumpâ€™s Closest Allies Just Called For Banning Women And Poor People From Voting (AUDIO) This is why no one should vote for a Republican ever again. Period.Donald Trump becoming president would be one of the scariest times in our history. And that s because democracy itself would be shattered if conservatives like Wayne Allyn Root have their way.During an interview with radio host Rob Schilling on Monday, Root, who is often the opening speaker and Master of Ceremonies at Trump rallies, openly called for stripping welfare and Medicaid recipients of their right to vote and said women who get  free contraception  should be barred from voting as well so that Republicans can win every election in this country by a landslide. So if the people who payed the taxes were the only ones allowed to vote, we d have landslide victories,  Root said,  but you re allowing people to vote. This explains everything! People with conflict of interest shouldn t be allowed to vote. If you collect welfare, you have no right to vote. The day you get off welfare, you get your voting rights back. The reality is, why are you allowed to have this conflict of interest that you vote for the politician who wants to keep your welfare checks coming and your food stamps and your aid to dependent children and your free health care and your Medicaid, your Medicare and your Social Security and everything else?Social Security should not, Medicare should not, because you paid into the system. But all the other stuff, all the other goodies, free Obama phones, free contraception, you know what, you can get them but you shouldn t be allowed to vote, it s a conflict of interest. Take that away, we d win every single election in this country. Here s the audio via Right Wing Watch:This is definitive proof that Donald Trump is too dangerous to be be president. And it is proof that conservatives are hell bent on taking away voting rights so they can gain absolute power.But there s a big problem with Root s plan. You see, Root s idea is based on the premise that minorities and liberals make up most of the people who take federal aid.In reality, Republicans would be stripping their own constituents of the right to vote if they listen to Root.According to Pew Research, the states where the most Americans are on welfare are red states, including, Wisconsin, Missouri, Tennessee, Texas, South Carolina, North Carolina, Arizona, New Mexico, Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia, Alabama, Maine, and Arkansas. Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Florida, which are considered battleground states but are also run by Republicans, are also on this list.And why are these states on this list? The answer is because Republican economic policies like the one Wayne Allyn Root supports, have swept more and more people into poverty, thus increasing the need for food assistance.In other words, Root s plan would have the opposite effect because it would keep many conservatives from voting in red states, which would devastate Republican majorities in those state legislatures.Furthermore, as Right Wing Watch points out, women don t actually get  free  birth control. The insurance companies are mandated to cover contraception in their health plans. In short, taxpayers are not paying for it, the women are paying for it every time they pay their premiums. One would think a businessman like Root would understand that, but who ever said Root was a competent businessman. After all, he s hanging out with Donald Trump. But the idea that we should strip women of their right to vote just because they get contraception is outrageous. And now we can add another reason why women should never vote for Republicans.In fact, the idea that we should strip any citizen in this nation of their right to vote is an affront to democracy and should by all rights lead to a landslide victory for Hillary Clinton in November.In other words, it s time to vote like it could be the last time we ever get a chance to do so, because if Republicans like Root have their way, it will be.Featured Image: Ralph Freso/Getty Images",Fake
" Texas Republican Rejects Canadian Offer Of Real Help For Hurricane Victims, Asks For Prayers Instead This is why religion should stay out of government.The people of Houston, Texas are drowning as flooding continues in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey.Death and destruction are everywhere, and people are desperate for any help that can be provided. People need food, shelter, clothing, and medical supplies.At this point, the people of Houston don t really care where the aid comes from as long as it comes.But Texas  Republican Secretary of State rejected an offer from Canada this week that would have provided blankets, beds, and physical manpower to the region affected by the storm.Quebec s Minister of International Relations Christine St-Pierre contacted Rolando Pablos to offer aid and condolences. It was a conversation about how devastating the situation is and we want to express our support to the people of Texas,  St-Pierre said.Had Pablos accepted Canada s help, many people in Texas could have had blankets, pillows, and perhaps even something more crucial. The manpower Canada offered would have come in the form of professional electricians who would have helped restore much needed power to residents and buildings such as hospitals and shelters. Our crews are well-equipped and they have good knowledge of the grid so they can help to restore and rebuild the distribution lines,  Hydro-Qu bec spokesperson Louis-Olivier Batty told CBC. Indeed, 250 Hydro-Quebec electricians did great work restoring power in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005.Canada offered real help to storm victims. But Republicans slapped away their hand of friendship. Instead of accepting the generous offer of supplies and volunteers, Texas Republicans rejected the offer and asked for  prayers from the people of Quebec. That s right. Texas Republicans think prayers can help them more than actual supplies and manpower.What the people of Texas need right now are not prayers. They need blankets, beds, and electrical power, all of which are in short supply because God sent a f*cking hurricane to slam the Texas coast.The people of Texas should be outraged that their elected officials are not accepting help from Canada. This offer could mean the difference between life and death for many people. Prayer is not going to help. It s a nice thought, but it won t do any good. People can t get warm by wrapping themselves in prayer. Electrical lines won t magically fix themselves because of prayer.This is why Republicans are totally unfit to lead. They offer prayers instead of real solutions. And that is going to cause more deaths and suffering in Texas.Featured Image: Screenshot ",Fake
" Elijah Cummings Called Trump Out To His Face And Hereâ€™s The Pathetic Way Trump Tried To Spin It Buried in Trump s bonkers interview with New York Times reporters Maggie Haberman and Glenn Thrush is this outrageous exchange Trump claims happened recently:TRUMP: [U.S. Representative] Elijah Cummings was in my office and he said,  You will go down as one of the great presidents in the history of our country. HABERMAN: Really?TRUMP: And then he went out and I watched him on television yesterday and I said,  Was that the same man? Which  would have been odd considering Cummings, a fiery Democratic congressman, has been one of Trump s most intense critics. He s very public about it. Cummings has been outspoken about Trump s disturbing connections to Russia, the GOP s botched attempts to cover those connections up, and has repeatedly demanded Trump divest himself of his numerous conflicts of interest. He hardly sounds like a person who has looked at Trump s trainwreck first three months in office and concluded that he deserves to be up on Mount Rushmore.One theory was that Trump flatly lied. Always a possibility   Trump is a pathological liar. Another, suggested by writer Jamelle Bouie, is that Trump mixed up two black men, conflating Cummings with some other guy. Another strong possibility   Trump has shown a complete lack of interest in the lives of black Americans.Fortunately, Cummings came in to provide the real answer: Trump took a criticism Cummings has made to his face and filtered it through his unchecked narcissism. Here s how Cummings describes the meeting Trump said was about praising him: During my meeting with the president and on several occasions since then, I have said repeatedly that he could be a great president if   if   he takes steps to truly represent all Americans rather than continuing on the divisive and harmful path he is currently on. Note the jab that Trump completely missed? IF Trump stops being  divisive and harmful  he could someday be a great president. So far he has not done so. Hasn t even tried. (As if to underscore how little Trump has tried to stop being divisive, in the same interview he defended Bill O Reilly for sexually harassing women at Fox News.)Unintentionally, Trump s bizarre retelling of what went down during his meeting with Cummings exemplifies the warped way Trump sees the world. A criticism turns into praise, stripping away all context in the process. It may explain, for example, why Trump seems to genuinely believe he saw Muslim Americans celebrating on 9/11. His ego filters everything, facts get distorted and retooled for his own agenda.The fact that we have a president who does not seem to understand the difference between reality and the fantasy world that exists in his head is a recipe for disaster. If meetings with a congressman get this distorted, what other delusions is Trump living in?Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",Fake
" Trump SCREAMS On Twitter After Seeing A Poll On Fox News Rex Tillerson was right. Donald Trump is a f*cking moron.After years of slamming polls as  fake,  Trump had the nerve to tout a poll on Sunday morning after Fox & Friends reported on it.The POLITICO/Morning Consult poll results show that 46 percent of respondents think the media fabricates stories about Trump.So, of course, the poll sent Trump to Twitter so he could literally scream about it and claim that his constant labeling of news outlets as  fake news  are  sinking through It is finally sinking through. 46% OF PEOPLE BELIEVE MAJOR NATIONAL NEWS ORGS FABRICATE STORIES ABOUT ME. FAKE NEWS, even worse! Lost cred.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 22, 2017Let s all keep in mind that this is ONE poll. Furthermore, the results were largely split down partisan lines, with 76 percent of Republicans believing that the news media make up stories about Trump. That number rises to 85 percent among Trump s most ardent supporters.If this poll had the opposite results, Trump would be dismissing it as a fake. And we all know it.Trump only thinks news stories and polls are accurate when they kiss his ass. That s why Fox & Friends is watched by Trump on a daily basis. They not only kiss his ass, they practically give him a blow-job every morning.Back in July, a PPP poll showed that a majority of Americans trust the news media more than they trust Trump.Over 50 percent of Americans said they trust NBC, CNN, ABC, the New York Times, and The Washington Post more than they trust Trump. The percentage of people who said they trust Trump more only hovered in the mid-30s.You know what else currently stands in the mid-30s? Trump s approval rating. The latest Gallup poll shows that only 35 percent of Americans approve of Trump s job performance. The Politico poll has it at 44 percent, so you can probably guess which poll Trump will call  fake.

"Reporters barred from Kushner Companies' event in China SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Organizers barred journalists on Sunday from a publicly advertised event in Shanghai that offered Chinese investors the chance to get U.S. immigrant visas if they put money in a real estate project linked to the family of President Donald Trumpâ€™s son-in-law. The two-tower luxury apartment complex in New Jersey, One Journal Square, is being developed by KABR Group and the Kushner Companies, which until recently was headed by senior White House advisor Jared Kushner, the husband of Trumpâ€™s daughter Ivanka. The developers are seeking to raise $150 million, or 15.4 percent of funding for the project, from investors through the EB-5 visa program, according to marketing materials posted by the eventâ€™s organizer, immigration agency Qiaowai. The controversial EB-5 program allows wealthy foreigners to, in effect, buy U.S. immigration visas for themselves and families by investing at least $500,000 in certain development projects. â€œSorry, this is a private event,â€ said a man stopping journalists from entering a function room at the Four Seasons Hotel in Shanghai. Guests at the event said Kushnerâ€™s sister, Nicole Kushner Meyer, spoke for about 10 minutes, including about her familyâ€™s humble roots. According to the New York Times, Meyer attended a similar event in Beijing on Saturday and told the audience of about 100 people the project â€œmeans a lot to me and my entire familyâ€. Jared Kushner, whose White House portfolio includes relations with China, sold his stake in Kushner Companies to a family trust early this year.  â€œMr. Kushner has no involvement in the operation of Kushner Companies and divested his interests in the One Journal Square project by selling them to a family trust that he, his wife, and his children are not beneficiaries of, a mechanism suggested by the Office of Government Ethics,â€ his lawyer, Blake Roberts of WilmerHale law firm, said in a statement emailed to Reuters by the White House. â€œAs previously stated, he will recuse from particular matters concerning the EB-5 visa program.â€ A Kushner Companies spokeswoman declined to comment in a New York Times article about the Beijing event published on Saturday. The Times story said Meyer did not respond when asked if she was concerned about possible conflicts of interest facing her brother. Journalists from the Times and Washington Post were removed from Saturdayâ€™s Beijing event, the newspapers reported. One potential investor, Sophie Xing, said a â€œvery importantâ€ factor in her decision to attend Sundayâ€™s event was the fact the project was a Kushner Companies investment and that Trumpâ€™s son-in-lawâ€™s sister would be in Shanghai. â€œActually I really donâ€™t know how close they are but I felt that this was a pretty good project,â€ she said. In a promotional text message seen by Reuters, Qiaowai made note of Meyerâ€™s relationship to Trump and called her the eventâ€™s â€œheavyweight honored guestâ€. Qiaowai representatives at the event declined to answer questions from journalists, and calls to its listed phone number went unanswered. Qiaowai is also known as QWOS. Its promotional materials for the project, which it also calls Kushner1, advertise the prospect of putting money in under the federal EB-5 program. The program is popular among wealthy Chinese looking to shift assets abroad or move overseas, but it has come under fire in the United States. Some U.S. lawmakers have called for changing or abolishing  the EB-5 program, but the scheme was recently renewed by Congress until Sept. 30. Potential investor Xing said a Kushner representative who spoke on Sunday stressed that EB-5 rules could change after September to raise the minimum required investment. Another person who attended Sundayâ€™s event, Liu Guoqi, was mindful of the potential rule change. Liu said he had been to previous pitches for EB-5 investments but had concerns about the risks. â€œThe whole thing may change later this year so we feel that there isnâ€™t much time left,â€ he said. In the United States, the EB-5 program has also sparked concerns about possible scams. Some immigrants have been burned by misrepresentations made about the program by promoters, both inside and outside the United States. Many have lost not only their money but their chance at winning U.S. citizenship. Trump has vowed to clamp down on illegal immigration. In addition to Beijing and Shanghai, the road show for One Journal Square was scheduled to visit the Chinese cities of Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Wuhan, according to Qiaowaiâ€™s marketing materials online. It calls the Kushner family a â€œfamous real estate clanâ€, and touts EB-5 immigration as â€œpeace of mindâ€. Qiaowaiâ€™s Chinese-language marketing material describes the project as â€œsupported by the government, created by a star developerâ€, and says the project is its 87th EB-5 program. (This story has been refiled to fix spelling of Qiaowai in paragraphs 17, 18.) ",Real
"Trump's tax cut won't be the biggest in U.S. history WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump repeatedly says his proposed tax cut would be the biggest in U.S. history, but it will not even come close to the record. Trump would be on target if he were talking only about corporate taxes, but he has included other taxes in his boast. The president and his fellow Republicans in Congress propose cutting the top corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. If they succeed, it would be the largest American corporate tax cut since the modern corporate tax began more than a century ago. As proposed by the Republicans, the corporate rate would fall 43 percent, compared with the second-largest such cut of 26 percent under Republican President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s.  But on individual taxes, Trump's claim does not hold up, according to data on top personal income tax rates collected by the Tax Foundation, a Washington think tank. (For a graphic tracking U.S. tax rates, see: tmsnrt.rs/2z5Cv20) Some Republicans in Congress are backing away from cutting the top individual tax rate, now 39.6 percent. But even if they did cut it as low as Trump wants, to 35 percent, the president would not even come close to winning bragging rights.    The Reagan cuts lowered the top rate to 28 percent from 70 percent. That was an impressive 60 percent drop. But the huge tax cuts of President Warren Harding and President Calvin Coolidge, both Republicans, take the prize. In 1922, the top tax rate was 73 percent. By 1925, it was only 25 percent, almost a 66 percent decline. Coolidge alone was responsible for a 57 percent cut in taxes. Under President John Kennedy and President Lyndon Johnson, both Democrats, the tax cuts of 1964 and 1965 cut the top rate to 70 percent from 91 percent, a decline of 23 percent. Still, there are other ways to measure the size of a tax cut besides the rates themselves. One approach would measure how much tax revenue the federal government does not get and  taxpayers get to keep. That is the â€œcostâ€ of a tax cut. But that number is disputed between those who favor tax cuts and those who do not. The Trump administration argues its tax cuts will ignite the economy and tax revenue will increase, not decrease. That way, the cuts â€œpay for themselves,â€ they say.  The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan Washington think tank, estimated the Trump tax cut could be the fourth-largest as a percentage of gross domestic product, or GDP, a measure of national economic output. The think tank favors that measure because it eliminates the effects of inflation, economic growth and the size of total federal revenue. By that measure, it agreed with a number of economists who said the Reagan cuts were the largest in history, even larger than Coolidgeâ€™s.   As for bragging rights to the all-time biggest tax hike, the winner is Democratic President Woodrow Wilson. During World War One, he increased the top individual rate to 77 percent from 7 percent and the corporate rate to 12 percent from 1 percent. ",Real
" Leave It To Obama To ROAST Trump For Saying Heâ€™s Best For This Specific Voting Bloc (VIDEO) If you haven t noticed, Donald Trump isn t quite the epitome of the average working American. He s a guy who was born into wealth, got his start through his father, and claims he s a terrific businessman. As the old saying goes, he was born on third base but thinks he hit a triple.Out on the campaign trail pointing out this utter disconnect between Trump and working America is none other than President Obama. The president can t seem to quite wrap his head around the fact that people would choose a man who can t relate whatsoever to the plight of working America to represent them.While speaking at a rally for Hillary Clinton, Obama said: Really, this is the guy you want to be championing working people? This guy who spent 70 years on this earth showing no concern for working people. This guy s suddenly going to be your champion? He spent most of his life trying to stay as far away from working people as he could. And now this guy is gonna be  the champion of working people.  Huh? I mean, he wasn t gonna let you on his golf course. He wasn t gonna let you buy in his condo. And now suddenly, this guy s gonna be your champion? And the answer to that would be, no, he s not. Trump is only in this race for Trump and no one else.

"House to vote on self-driving car legislation next week (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives will vote Wednesday on a sweeping proposal to speed the deployment of self-driving cars without human controls and bar states from blocking autonomous vehicles, congressional aides said. The bill, which was passed unanimously by a House panel in July, would allow automakers to obtain exemptions to deploy up to 25,000 vehicles without meeting existing auto safety standards in the first year, a cap that would rise to 100,000 vehicles annually over three years. Automakers and technology companies including General Motors Co and Alphabet Incâ€™sâ€™ self-driving unit Waymo have been pushing for new federal rules making it easier to deploy self-driving technology. Meanwhile, some consumer groups have sought additional safeguards.  The bill will be voted under fast-track rules that do not allow for amendments. A bipartisan group of U.S. senators has been working on similar legislation but has not introduced a bill. â€œSelf-driving vehicles stand to make our transportation system safer and more efficient. Advancing this technology to road-ready requires government policy that encourages continued testing and development,â€ House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a Republican, said in a statement. â€œThis formula is the foundation for what makes America the most innovative country in the world.â€   The Alliance of Automobile Manufacters, a trade group, said in a statement that â€œCongress can bring a host of benefits to Americans by helping to bring self-driving vehicles to our roads as quickly as possible.â€ Republicans Representatives Greg Walden and Robert Latta said in a joint statement the â€œvote will pave the way for the safe testing, development, and deployment of self-driving cars across the U.S.â€ The issue has taken on new urgency since U.S. road deaths rose 7.7 percent in 2015, the highest annual jump since 1966. Automakers and technology companies believe chances are good that Congress will approve legislation before year end. Current federal rules bar self-driving cars without human controls on U.S. roads and automakers think proposed state rules in California are too restrictive. The measure, the first significant federal legislation aimed at speeding self-driving cars to market, would require automakers to submit safety assessment reports to regulators, but would not require pre-market approval of advanced vehicle technologies. Initially, authors proposed to allow automakers and others to sell up to 100,000 vehicles immediately. Representative Frank Pallone, a Democrat, said the phase-in period was essential so â€œmillions of exempted cars will not hit our roads all at once.â€ Manufacturers must demonstrate self-driving cars winning exemptions are at least as safe as existing vehicles. Under the House proposal, states could still set rules on registration, licensing, liability, insurance and safety inspections, but could not set self-driving car performance standards. Consumer advocates have sought more changes, including giving the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration quicker access to crash data and more funding to oversee self-driving cars.    ",Real

"Despite undiplomatic discourse, Trump's dance card is full UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - A subtle diplomat like Talleyrand, Donald Trump is not. The U.S. president, in his first foray at the U.N. General Assembly, derided North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as a â€œrocket man ... on a suicide missionâ€ and delivered an unabashed defense of sovereignty at the seat of global multilateralism. But if his speech drew barbs from allies and authoritarian adversaries, it did nothing to deter his dance partners at the premier diplomatic waltz of the year, the 193-member United Nationsâ€™ annual gathering of world leaders known by the acronym UNGA. Trump held bilateral meetings with 13 leaders this week,   more than his predecessor Barack Obama had at his first UNGA(five), his last (six) or his busiest (10), according to data compiled by CBS News White House correspondent Mark Knoller. Trumpâ€™s less than diplomatic speech on Tuesday recalled the fiery nationalist language of his Jan. 20 inaugural address and raised eyebrows across the political spectrum by its bald assertion of the primacy of U.S. interests. â€œOur governmentâ€™s first duty is to its people, to our citizens - to serve their needs, to ensure their safety, to preserve their rights, and to defend their values,â€ he said, evoking his campaignâ€™s nationalist themes despite the departure of advocates such as Steve Bannon from the White House.  Germanyâ€™s foreign minister, Sigmar Gabriel, delivered a riposte in a scathing and barely veiled critique on Thursday. â€œNational egoism, I believe, is worthless as a regulatory principle for our world,â€ Gabriel said. â€œThe motto â€˜our country firstâ€™ not only leads to more national confrontations and less prosperity, in the end there can only be losers.â€ Robert Mugabe, Zimbabweâ€™s authoritarian 93-year-old leader who has ruled the former British colony since independence in 1980, also sought to nudge Trump in a more peaceable direction. â€œMr. Trump, please blow your trumpet, blow your trumpet in a musical way towards the values of unity, peace, cooperation, togetherness, dialogue,â€ he said. In his speech, Trump said if the United States were forced to defend itself or its allies, it would have â€œno choice but to totally destroy North Koreaâ€ and he called Iranâ€™s government a â€œmurderous regimeâ€ that exports â€œviolence, bloodshed and chaos.â€ His directness contrasts with the subtlety of 18th- and 19th-century French diplomat Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand, who is reputed to have said: â€œA diplomat who says â€˜yesâ€™ means â€˜maybe,â€™ a diplomat who says â€˜maybeâ€™ means â€˜no,â€™ and a diplomat who says â€˜noâ€™ is no diplomat.â€ Still, Trumpâ€™s language has seeped into the discourse of other leaders, perhaps seeking to curry his favor. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas spoke of â€œdraining the swampâ€ of Israeli occupation while South Korean President Moon Jae-in called North Korean behavior â€œextremely deplorable.â€ Trump, possibly recalling the criticism that his Democratic U.S. presidential opponent Hillary Clinton earned for calling some of his supporters a â€œbasket of deplorables,â€ was pleased. â€œIâ€™m very happy that you used the word â€˜deplorableâ€™,â€ Trump told Moon. â€œThatâ€™s been a very lucky word for me and many millions of people.â€ Both Moon and Abbas had sitdowns with Trump, and there was no shortage of others who wanted to meet him. A U.S. official said the White House accommodated as many requests for meetings as they could schedule, noting some leaders who wanted to meet Trump did not make the cut. The U.S. president has also wanted to see the leaders of China, India and Germany, but they did not come this year. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani met Trump on Thursday, and officials in Kabul said all the impetus had come from the Afghan side, with no burning interest from the White House. French President Emmanuel Macron made clear he would work with any U.S. president, whoever he was, and said he and Trump had clear disagreements on climate change and Iran policy. â€œI want a deep, cordial dialogue to bring him back into the international and multilateral fold on these two subjects,â€ Macron told reporters. â€œAs Iâ€™m a pragmatist, I put myself in a position to work the best way possible with him.â€  Asked if dealing with Trump was like managing a difficult child, the French president replied: â€œNot at all. Iâ€™m managing a partner of the worldâ€™s biggest power and a historical partner for our country.â€ ",Real
"Trump officials defend immigration arrests at California courthouses LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Federal agents have arrested illegal immigrants at California courthouses because local authorities have made such apprehensions at jails difficult, the Trump administrationâ€™s top two law enforcement officials told the stateâ€™s chief justice, who had requested a halt to the practice. In a letter to Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye made public on Friday, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly gave no indication that agents would stop the arrests. Sessions and Kelly criticized California officials for limiting the cooperation of state and local law enforcement officers with U.S. agents, preventing them from going to jails to pick up illegal immigrants arrested for other crimes.   â€œAs a result, ICE officers and agents are required to locate and arrest these aliens in public places, rather than in secure jail facilities,â€ Sessions and Kelly wrote in the letter dated on Wednesday, using the acronym for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Kelly, whose Department of Homeland Security includes ICE, and Sessions, who as attorney general heads the Justice Department, are members of Republican President Donald Trumpâ€™s Cabinet. Since taking office in January, Trump has widened the net for illegal immigrants to be detained and removed from the country, in keeping with his White House campaign promise. Immigrant rights groups say federal agents have entered courthouses with increased frequency this year, including in California, Massachusetts, Maryland and Texas. California law enforcement officers, including in Los Angeles and San Francisco, decline requests from ICE agents to hold illegal immigrants past their release dates in local jails so they can be transferred to federal custody. The stance of these law enforcement officials conforms with advice from the stateâ€™s two most recent attorneys general. These and other â€œsanctuaryâ€ jurisdictions that opt not to cooperate with federal immigration agents have drawn fire from conservative Republicans. On Monday, Sessions threatened to withhold millions of dollars in U.S. funding for cities that fail to assist immigration authorities. In their letter, Kelly and Sessions said agents make arrests at courthouses rather than other public places in part because visitors are screened for weapons before entering, as they are at jails. They were responding to a letter sent two weeks ago by Cantil-Sakauye, who asked the two Cabinet officials to stop immigration agents from arresting undocumented immigrants inside California courthouses. â€œCourthouses should not be used as bait in the necessary enforcement of our countryâ€™s immigration law,â€ she wrote.  The presence of immigration agents in courthouses in the nationâ€™s most populous state could undermine public trust in its judicial system, she said.  Her letter went on to say that immigration agents were â€œstalking undocumented immigrantsâ€ at courthouses, language that drew a sharp rebuke from Sessions and Kelly.  They said the use of the word â€œstalkingâ€ suggested criminal conduct. They said that was unwarranted because agents have full authority to arrest illegal immigrants. ",Real
"U.S. embassy to Russia to resume some visa services after diplomatic row MOSCOW (Reuters) - The U.S. Embassy to Russia said on Monday it would restart some visa services in U.S. consulates which it had previously canceled due to diplomatic expulsions that had left it short-staffed. The United States began to scale back its visa services in Russia in August, drawing an angry reaction from Moscow three weeks after President Vladimir Putin ordered Washington to more than halve its embassy and consular staff. The U.S. step meant Russian citizens wanting to visit the United States for business, tourism or educational reasons were  no longer able to apply via U.S. consulates outside Moscow and had to travel to the Russian capital instead. The embassy said in a statement on Monday some visa services would resume on Dec. 11. â€œOn December 11, the U.S. consulates in St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg, and Vladivostok will begin to offer limited interviews for non-immigrant visas,â€ it said.

" Jake Tapper Burns Trump With Bill Maher: He Is â€˜Empirically Indecentâ€™ (VIDEO) A lot about America has changed since the rise of Donald Trump. People thought that his coarse language, his clear racism and misogyny, and just generally appalling behavior would render him unacceptable to the American public. Yet, here we are. Donald Trump is president, and his young administration has fundamentally changed how the world views America, its citizens, and its government. One thing that hasn t changed though is the way some strident and brave media personalities continue to speak truth to power and insist on making sure that Trump s disgusting ways, his incompetence, and his lies don t fundamentally change who we are as a people. Perhaps the breakout star in that regard is CNN s Jake Tapper.Tapper hosts The Lead during the week, and State of the Union on Sunday mornings. On Friday night, the fiery host stopped by HBO s Real Time to have a chat with host Bill Maher. Of course, Maher had to ask about the changes Tapper has had to make now that there s the biggest liar on earth occupying the Oval Office. Tapper responded: You ve been covering politicians for a long time. Politicians lie. It wasn t invented on Jan. 20. I ve never seen this level of falsehood, quantitatively. Tapper went on to distinguish between what happens with say, falsehoods that happened with the Obama Administration such as,  If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.  He says of the lies coming out of the Trump White House: It s conspiracy theories based on nothing that have members of his own party distancing themselves from him. Then the conversation turns to Trump s vulgarity and other fundamental affronts to basic human decency in public discourse. Tapper says of the way Trump behaved on the campaign trail and how he continues to behave: The truth of the matter is that there is no bias when it comes to facts and there s no bias when it comes to decency. It s empirically indecent to make fun of the disabled. That s just indecent. My children know better than that. The two hosts then went on to reference what we all know   which is that most of the fundamental things that make Trump so awful, we all learn not to do in grade school. Maher says:I always think about that book  Everything I Needed to Know I learned in Kindergarten.  He violates every rule. Don t lie, don t accuse people of things they re not guilty of. Don t boast. Pay your taxes. Serve your country. Don t be a racist, don t insult   like you say   the handicapped people or other people who are not as lucky to be as great looking as you are, Donald. And yet, in spite of all of these things, people still voted for this fundamentally indecent, sorry excuse for a human being.

" Not A Single D.C. Public School Marching Band Will Participate In Trumpâ€™s Inauguration It s already been reported heavily that celebrities are in short supply for racist hatemonger and Russian-installed puppet Donald Trump s inauguration   but it seems he has a much more embarrassing problem. Even high school marching bands don t want to show up to celebrate his coronation.NBC Washington reports that high school bands   at least one of which has participated in the past five inauguration parades   have entirely opted out of applying for consideration this year:Ballou High School s Majestic Marching Knights performed Destiny s Child s  Lose My Breath  at George W. Bush s second inaugural parade in 2005, and stepped along Pennsylvania Avenue as they played James Brown s  I Got You (I Feel Good)  at Barack Obama s second inaugural parade eight years later.But the beloved band decided to take a break in January and not apply to play in the inaugural parade after several other recent performances, the principal said.Dunbar High School s band marched in Obama s first inauguration in 2009 but the school will sit this one out because they are rebuilding the band, the principal said.Eastern High School also chose not to participate, the principal said, without elaborating.In fact, a D.C. Public Schools spokeswoman says she isn t aware of a single band in the district that had applied to participate in the January 20 inaugural parade.Trump s problem doesn t extend to just high school bands. Howard University, which performed in Obama s first parade, also decided to just skip it this time. Band director John Newson cites  too few members  and  budgetary constraints,  but says he suspects that the low level of interest is tied to band directors  and school administrators  political beliefs (or, of course, their sense of decency). I think everybody knows why and no one wants to say and lose their job,  Newson said.NBC notes that the issue extends to neighboring counties as well:Like in D.C., many bands in the surrounding counties opted not to apply to participate in Trump s inauguration. No bands in Arlington County or Prince George s County public schools applied, according to district representatives. University of Maryland, College Park, which played in 2013, did not apply. A Fairfax County schools spokesman was not aware of any schools that had applied. And a Montgomery County schools spokeswoman did not have information available.Applications to be in the parade were due on December 5   extended once from November 28 to allow bands more time to apply   and the Presidential Inaugural Committee, which refuses to say how many bands applied, is expected to make an announcement as to which bands were selected soon   which should be quite embarrassing for The Donald.Featured image via Getty Images/Andrew Burton",Fake

Frankly, this put Russia and the media in a strange situation, because they didn t know who to believe   the official agencies or the many leaks.If the Trump administration continues leaking like a colander, she says, there will be consequences:Also, I would like to say that if the practice of leaking information that concerns not just the United States but also Russia, which has become a tradition in Washington in the past few years, continues, there will come a day when the media will publish leaks about the things that Washington asked us to keep secret, for example, things that happened during President Obama s terms in office. Believe me, this could be very interesting information.Recently, Trump has been in a panic trying to contain leaks   particularly about his and his administration s relationship with Russia.At this point, it is fair to ask: what do they have on him and other Republicans? Is this threat to release Obama-era information a veiled warning to The Donald to plug the holes through which facts are slipping?Featured image via Getty Images (Mikhail Svetlov/Pool)",Fake
" Local Fox Affiliate Just Gave Fox News A GIANT Middle Finger Over Their Biased News A local news station in Boston has had it with the Fox brand damaging their own reputation. WFXT Channel 25 is going to change the name of its newscast to Boston 25 News removing  Fox  entirely following a drop in its ratings and a study that showed their audience saw the newscast as  leaning conservative. Fox News itself has some ridiculous shows, like Fox & Friends and The O Reilly Factor, both of which tend to peddle not just misleading information, but also the very attitudes that make things worse, not better, in this country. For instance, on Fox & Friends this morning, Brian Kilmeade whined about conditions in immigration detention centers. But he wasn t talking about the stunning human rights abuses. He s upset about this: Get this: They re enjoying seven hours of outdoor activity. Who gets that anymore? Fresh sheets, and absolutely   I don t get that. No need to learn English. Co-host Ainsley Earhardt added: Seven hours of outdoor activity, freshly washed sheets, and absolutely no need to learn English. That s the easy life of an illegal immigrant inside American jails. Or clean sheets have something to do with basic sanitation, but hey, they ll think what they want here. The outdoor activity   it s not like they re in some Eden-like garden of paradise.There s also the whole controversy with Bill O Reilly and sexual harassment, and Fox News  failure to deal with their male employees who engage in such behavior. Billo the Clown is still on the air, and so far, Fox doesn t seem to have done much about it.Who wants to be associated with this crapola? WFXT is actually owned by Cox Media Group and not Fox News, but they re still considered a Fox affiliate and the brand carries a reputation that is increasingly negative. Massachusetts is a deep blue state, and their businesses and media outlets need to act accordingly to continue reaching their audiences.This decision is actually a few years in the making   it didn t just happen. WFXT s news director, Mike Oliveria, said that Massachusetts viewers want unbiased news. Fox News is decidedly not unbiased, but WFXT strives to be, as do most local newscasts. He said: It s not that [Fox is] a bad brand; it s just that it s not ours. While other Fox affiliates under Cox Media s umbrella aren t considering dropping  Fox  from their names at this time, we have t wonder if that s going to change.Featured image by Spencer Platt via Getty Images",Fake
" WATCH: Joy Reid OWNS Trump In Less Than 30 Seconds For Claiming To Be More Popular Than Obama Joy Reid rained on Donald Trump s parade on Sunday morning, and it was glorious.Earlier in the morning, Trump declared on Twitter that his poll numbers are better than President Obama s and posted about how Rasmussen, a conservative leaning polling firm, has his approval rating at 50 percent.The new Rasmussen Poll, one of the most accurate in the 2016 Election, just out with a Trump 50% Approval Rating.That s higher than O s # s!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2017Well, AM Joy host Joy Reid quickly destroyed Trump with a smile and some snark. Trump also tweeted about his poll numbers this morning, citing a new poll that puts his approval rating at 50 percent and saying that s higher than O s numbers,  Reid said before pointing out that Trump is obsessed with Obama.  Obsessed with President Obama much?  she continued.Reid then noted that other polls have Trump s approval rating much lower than Rasmussen. In fact, his rating is the lowest in history. The only poll showing Trump at 50 percent was Rasmussen, which Reid trashed. See if you can spot the outlier,  she asked the audience.Here s the video via VidMe.Donald had better see someone quickly about that burn.But it s even worse for him because his claim is not even close to being accurate. As it turns out, President Obama s approval rating on June 18, 2009 was 55 percent. And the polling firm that reported that finding happens to be Rasmussen, the same polling firm Trump is bragging about now. And last time I checked, 55 is still bigger than 50. That means Trump s claim that he has a higher number than Obama is totally false.Reid is right about Trump being obsessed with President Obama. Trump has tried to destroy Obama s legacy at every turn and he is constantly claiming to be a better president even though he has been a complete disaster for this country. Trump legislative record is laughable since the only bills he signs are minor ones that designate buildings and other little things that don t really matter. He has not signed a single piece of major legislation yet, and he is been in office over 100 days already.Mostly, he has been signing executive orders, which Trump and conservatives repeated whined about Obama doing. Trump is on pace to sign more executive orders than Obama ever did. Furthermore, Trump is also on pace to take more vacation days and play more rounds of golf in a single year than Obama ever did.Trump is an embarrassment to this nation and his poll numbers are only going to get worse once his supporters begin to truly realize that they have been duped.Featured Image: Screenshot",Fake
" New Poll: Clinton Picks Up Unprecedented, Historical Support Among Young Voters Several weeks ago, polls and pundits were spelling doom and gloom for Hillary Clinton. Why? Support among millennial voters   the biggest voting bloc in the country   were dwindling for the Democrat nominee, and were instead attracted to third party candidates Gary Johnson and Jill Stein.Two polls, released within days of each other, showed over a third of millennials backing a third party candidate, severely cutting into Clinton s chances of winning over the Obama coalition.But as the race comes to a close, millennials are finally seeing the big picture: do we elect and accomplished, qualified politico or a racist, sexual predator? Luckily, millennials have chosen the former over the latter.A new poll just released by USA Today   Rock The Vote, with the help of Ipsos, found that Hillary Clinton holds a 40 point lead over Donald Trump when it comes to millennial voters, 68 percent to 20 percent. Johnson nabbed 8 percent and Stein a dismal 1 percent.Almost 7 in 10 young people now support Clinton. To put that into context, President Obama won the youth vote with 66 percent support in 2008, and 67 percent in 2012. That means that Clinton is on track, just barely, to ushering in a historical and unprecedented win among young voters which would propel her to the White House.A study conducted by the Center for Research and Information on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University found that, when it came to the 2012 election, the youth vote was the decisive factor in who won. The study found that because millennial voters came out in droves to support Obama, at least 80 electoral votes were awarded, all from key swing states   Pennsylvania, Ohio, Florida and Virginia. Coincidentally, all those states are considered swing states in the 2016 election (with the exception of Virginia).If 68 percent of just half of the millennial population votes for Hillary Clinton on November 8, she wins, hands down, and that s not even taking into consideration her gains among white, college educated women and men (who typically vote Republican). That s also not taking into consideration her gains made with Asian-Americans and Cuban Americans.Clinton has the numbers to win. She has made gains all across the board, and Trump is under-performing Mitt Romney in crucial swing states, with typical GOP voters, and with those who typically don t vote GOP. The only thing that can hold Clinton back is Democrats not showing up to vote, especially young people.This is why this year s Get Out the Vote will be detrimental to results in the coming weeks. With early voting underway (in record numbers), Democrats have a real opportunity to start off on strong footing and cruise into the November general election.Featured image via Ethan Miller/Getty Images",Fake

They openly talked to reporters at rallies with threats of assassinating Clinton if Trump lost. All we want is a recount to be sure it was a fair election.As Hillary Clinton s campaign counsel said in a statement,  It is a fundamental principle of our democracy to ensure that every vote is properly counted. What is Team Trump so worried about? Trump said the election would be rigged and openly called for the Russians to hack Clinton s emails.Hillary Clinton now leads the popular vote by 2.2 million, and that number is expected to continue to increase._____________________________________________________________________________________Featured image via screen capture",Fake
" Trump Now Says Wall May Not Need A Wall To Cover Entire US-Mexico Border Keeping in line with his constant backtracking and just generally erratic ways, President Donald Trump has taken a softer stance on what was seen as essentially his core campaign promise by claiming that the 2,000 mile long wall he initially intended to build along the border with Mexico may not need to cover the full distance due to natural borders that already exist. You have mountains. You have some rivers that are violent and vicious. You have some areas that are so far away that you don t really have people crossing,  the President told reporters aboard Air Force One on his recent flight to Paris.  But you ll need anywhere from 700 to 900 miles. Trump made the construction of a big beautiful wall, with a big beautiful door,  a solid structure 30 feet high in an effort to curb illegal immigration the cornerstone of his 2016 election campaign, insisting that Mexico would pay for it with the cost estimated to be in the vicinity of $20 billion, although he later stated that could be cut by covering the wall in solar panels. Naturally Mexico has refused to pay, most likely because they never requested the border wall in the first place, however, Trump still believes he will find a way to get them to cough up the cash after construction begins.But if you believe that the President s insistence that Mexico will reimburse the US for construction for the wall is the only flaw in his plan, you are sadly mistaken. First of all, almost all of that  700 to 900 miles  that Trump mentioned, less than half of the length of the US-Mexico border, already has walls and fences. In fact, the current border wall is already 650 miles long. Also, as for the rivers that are  violent and vicious,  yes a large part of the border in Texas consists of the Rio Grande, but some parts of that river are barely more than a trickle of water.President Trump also now believes the border wall needs to be transparent. You have to be able to see through it,  he said.  As horrible as it sounds, when they throw the large sacks of drugs over, and if you have people on the other side of the wall, you don t see them. They hit you on the head with 60 pounds of stuff? It s over. We re now six months into his presidency and Trump has only requested $1.6 billion from Congress for the project, or roughly 8 percent of the total estimate. Maybe he has just learned that according to Pew Research Center, approximately 66 percent of the illegal immigrants in the US have been here for at least a decade, that the amount of illegal Mexican immigrants has been in decline for the last 10 years and is now one million less than it was in 2007, or that Mexicans only make up 52 percent of illegal immigrants in the United States.Featured image via Sandy Huffaker/Getty Images",Fake

" China Fires Warning At Trump For Contacting Taiwan In Violation Of One-China Policy Donald Trump has not even taken office yet and he has already pissed off the most populous nation on the planet.For nearly 40 years, the United States and made it policy that the American president does not contact the leader of Taiwan for the sake of stable relations with China.But Donald Trump violated that policy on Friday by talking to Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen.China does not recognize Taiwan as an independent nation and considers the island its territory. This goes all the way back to 1949 when Chiang Kai-shek evacuated his Nationalist forces to Taiwan after being defeated by Communist forces in the Chinese Civil War.China has refused to recognize Taiwan ever since and considers it a renegade territory.Trump claims that the phone call was merely congratulatory and that both sides expressed that  close economic, political and security ties exist between Taiwan and the United States. But if you believe that, I have a golden tower to sell you. Most likely, Trump is getting cozy with Taiwan because his company wants to build luxury hotels and resorts on the island, which is yet another conflict of interest Trump has refused to deal with and is more proof that Trump only wants to use the presidency for his own selfish financial gain.Trump s action has been criticized by diplomats and state department personnel. And his recklessness has now drawn an angry response from the Chinese government.In a statement, the Chinese foreign ministry lodged a formal protest and warned Trump to beware of risking relations between our two nations again.  It must be pointed out that there is only one China in the world,  Chinese officials said.  We urge the relevant side in the US to adhere to the  one China  policy, abide by the pledges in the three joint China-US communiques, and handle issues related to Taiwan carefully and properly to avoid causing unnecessary interference to the overall China-U.S. relationship. Again, Trump has not even taken office yet and he is already screwing up decades worth of established foreign policy, proving once again that he is too irresponsible to be president.China is a major holder of U.S. foreign debt and is a major manufacturer of products sold by American businesses. So pissing the Chinese off could not only lead to a war, it could substantially cripple our economy.Donald Trump serious needs to read the relevant intelligence and foreign policy briefings so he doesn t do anything stupid like this again.Featured Image: Drew Angerer/Getty Images",Fake
"Russia probe special counsel interviews ex-Trump chief of staff Priebus (Reuters) - President Donald Trumpâ€™s former White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus was interviewed on Friday by the special counsel investigating whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 U.S. election. â€œMr. Priebus was voluntarily interviewed by Special Counsel Muellerâ€™s team today,â€ said his lawyer, William Burck. â€œHe was happy to answer all of their questions.â€ Special Counsel Robert Muellerâ€™s investigators are interviewing a number of White House and other officials as part of the inquiry into any ties between Trumpâ€™s presidential campaign and Russia. Muellerâ€™s inquiry includes whether Trump might have obstructed justice by trying to persuade then-FBI Director James Comey to drop an investigation of Michael Flynn, the presidentâ€™s first national security adviser. Flynn resigned in February after disclosures that he had discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia with the Russian ambassador to the United States before Trump took office and misled Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations.

" Trump Firing Special Counsel Investigating Russian Connections A Possibility According To Attorney Robert Mueller, the man selected in May by the Justice Department to head the investigation into Russia s interference in the 2016 presidential election, probably thought the job was relatively secure when he initially accepted the position, but now Donald Trump s attorneys most likely have Mueller second-guessing his decision.In an interview on Sunday, Jay Sekulow, one of Trump s attorneys, alluded to the fact that he wouldn t completely rule out the possibility that the president may fire Mueller from leading the investigation into Trump s campaign. Why would he fire Mueller? Simply because he can.ABC s George Stephanopoulos was interviewing Sekulow on the program This Week on Sunday and the topic of the investigation came up. Stephanopoulos asked Sekulow if the president would give any assurance that he would not interfere in the investigation into Russian ties or order U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a man that many believe has already committed perjury on more than one occasion since he was sworn in for the position in early February, to fire Mueller. Sekulow s response wasn t particularly convincing. Look, the President of the United States, as we all know, is a unitary executive,  Sekulow said during the interview.  But the president is going to seek the advice of his counsel and inside the government as well as outside. And I m not going to speculate on what he will, or will not, do. So, not only did Sekulow not give any assurance that Trump would pledge not to meddle in the investigation or have Mueller fired, he completely avoided acknowledging both points. In fact, Sekulow went on to add that he  can t imagine  the issue of firing the head of the investigation would arise, but  that, again, is an issue that the president with his advisers would discuss if there was a basis. Nobody said getting to the bottom of the Russia scandal was going to be easy.Featured image via Andrew Burton/Getty Images",Fake

"Democrats amass support to force showdown over Trump Supreme Court pick WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats on Monday corralled enough support to hold up a Senate confirmation vote on President Donald Trumpâ€™s Supreme Court nominee but Republicans threatened to change the Senate rules to ensure conservative judge Neil Gorsuch gets the lifetime job. The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 11-9 along party lines to send Gorsuchâ€™s nomination to the full Senate, setting up a political showdown this week between Trumpâ€™s fellow Republicans and the opposition Democrats that appears likely to trigger a change in long-standing Senate rules to allow his confirmation. Democrats, portraying Gorsuch as so conservative he is outside the judicial mainstream, have amassed 42 senators in support of a procedural hurdle called a filibuster requiring a super-majority of 60 votes in the Republican-led, 100-seat Senate to allow a confirmation vote. Even before the panel voted, committee member Christopher Coons put the Democrats over the threshold as the 41st senator backing the filibuster bid. (GRAPHIC - Where senators stand on bid to block Gorsuch vote tmsnrt.rs/2ov6ko0)  The Senateâ€™s Republican leaders insist Gorsuch will be confirmed on the Senate floor on Friday regardless of what the Democrats do. Republicans hold a 52-48 Senate majority. In the face of the filibuster, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would be expected to force a confirmation vote by having the Senate change its rules and allow for a simple majority vote for confirmation of Supreme Court justices, a move sometimes called the â€œnuclear optionâ€ that Trump favors. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, leading the filibuster effort, said McConnell should have the â€œvision and courage to see past this impasseâ€ and not â€œgo nuclear,â€ suggesting that Trump replace Gorsuch with a new consensus nominee chosen after meeting with Democrats. Senate confirmation of Gorsuch, 49, would restore the nine-seat high courtâ€™s conservative majority, fulfilling one of Trumpâ€™s top promises during the 2016 presidential campaign. Trump in January nominated Gorsuch, a conservative appeals court judge from Colorado. He could be expected to serve for decades. On the Senate floor, McConnell called the Democratic strategy â€œa new low,â€ saying there was no principled reason to oppose a judge as well qualified and widely respected as Gorsuch. He did not explicitly say he would use the â€œnuclear option,â€ but several Republicans said that would happen. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the decision would be McConnellâ€™s. Republican Senator John McCain, a long-time opponent of Senate rules changes, told reporters he would support the move. Judiciary Committee Republicans blasted Democrats for pursuing what they called the first â€œpartisan filibusterâ€ of a Supreme Court nominee - there was a successful bipartisan filibuster five decades ago against a Democratic presidentâ€™s nominee - and said it would come to naught because of the threatened rule change. But it was Senate Republicans who last year refused to even consider Democratic former President Barack Obamaâ€™s nomination of appellate judge Merrick Garland to fill the same high court vacancy that Trump has selected Gorsuch to fill. â€œDemocrats, including me, are still furious at the way Judge Merrick Garland was treated last year. But the traditions and principles that have defined the Senate are crumbling, and we are poised to hasten that destruction this week,â€ Coons said. Gorsuch was nominated to fill a vacancy created by the February 2016 death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia. Democrats have accused Gorsuch of being insufficiently independent of Trump, evading questions on key Supreme Court rulings of the past including on abortion and political spending, and favoring corporate interests over ordinary Americans. Republicans control the White House and Congress for the first time in a decade. The inability of Senate Republicans to coax enough Democratic support to avoid the â€œnuclear optionâ€ reflected the intense partisan divide in Washington and the Trump administrationâ€™s failure to win the cooperation of the opposition party. Senators Dianne Feinstein, the committeeâ€™s top Democrat, and panel member Patrick Leahy, along with fellow Democrats Mark Warner and Ben Cardin, also announced filibuster support on Monday. Spicer accused Democrats of partisan obstruction that sets â€œa very dangerous precedentâ€ and told a briefing that â€œweâ€™re obviously disappointed that the overwhelming majority of them are still playing politics with the nationâ€™s highest court.â€ The actual confirmation vote would be by a simple majority if the filibuster is stopped. To date, four Democrats oppose a filibuster, four short of the eight that Republicans needed. With the failure of Republican healthcare legislation in Congress and with courts blocking the presidentâ€™s ban on people from several Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States, winning confirmation for Gorsuch has taken on even more importance for Trump. The 60-vote super-majority threshold that gives the minority party power to hold up the majority party has over the decades forced the Senate to try to achieve bipartisanship in legislation and presidential appointments. Republican committee member Lindsey Graham said, â€œIf we have to, we will change the rules, and it looks like weâ€™re going to have to. I hate that. I really, really do.â€ While Gorsuchâ€™s opponents would fight a Senate rule change, it was the Democrats who in 2013 changed the Senate rules to limit filibusters after Republicans used the procedure against Obamaâ€™s appeals court nominees.  The Senate, then led by Democrats, barred filibusters for executive branch nominees and federal judges aside from Supreme Court justices. Even if Republicans do change the rules, legislation, as opposed to appointments, would still need to meet a 60-vote threshold. ",Real
" Itâ€™s Time To Stop Excusing Trump Supporters And Start Shaming Them For The Awful People They Are For nigh on two years now, people have been making the argument that not all Trump voters are racist, misogynistic bigots. This could be true; after all, there are people who voted for Barack Obama twice, but then switched to Donald Trump. The idea of this makes most of us scratch our heads because Obama was everything Trump isn t. President Obama is dignified, classy, smart, experienced, accepting of all people. Trump is bigoted to his core, narcissistic, incompetent, impulsive, undignified, unpresidential. Therefore, how could people who voted enthusiastically for Barack Obama vote for Donald Trump? I still don t know the answer to that question. What I do know is this: It s time to stop making excuses for Trump voters and start shaming them, because that is what they deserve.Even if someone who voted for Donald Trump isn t personally a racist, a misogynist, a homophobe, or an Islamophobe, they certainly are tolerant of those various bigotries and then some. They were able to look at the Access Hollywood tape, Trump s call to ban all Muslims from the nation, his kicking off his campaign by calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals, his promise (and current attempts to carry out that promise) to round up hundreds of thousands of people and kick them out of the nation, his five-year-long crusade to delegitimize the first Black president   all of it   and still vote for him. They were able to realize just what a Trump Administration and all of its disgusting white supremacist glory would do to every American who is not a straight, white, Christian man and still pull the lever for him. These voters are selfish people who took an unconscionably callous position when it comes to the fate of millions of Americans. They knew he d do things like stacking the courts   lifetime appointments, by the way   with conspiracy theorists, racists, misogynists, and birthers, and they still voted for Trump.I could go on, but you get the picture.Trump voters watched the same campaign the rest of us did, and they saw the abhorrent behavior, the unending stream of bigotry, the dangerous flirtation with authoritarian figures around the world, the clear unfitness, and they voted for him anyway. These are not good people. It s time to stop making excuses for the people who voted for the most bigoted, ignorant, dangerous president in modern history. We have literal Nazis working in the White House because of these people. We have, in Jeff Sessions, a man who was deemed too racist in 1986 to be a federal judge as Attorney General. We have birthers on the federal bench. That s all their fault.There are no good people who are Trump voters. It s time we recognized a hard truth: There s no such thing as a good person who supports Donald Trump. Stop excusing them and start shaming them. It s up to us to recognize the ills in the American populous   starting with the absolute imbeciles who voted for Donald Trump.Featured image via Daily Kos",Fake
" Hereâ€™s How Trump Is Going To F*CK Us Into WWIII, And It Doesnâ€™t Actually Start In The Middle East Has anybody ever wondered whether all these acts of war, including the MOAB we just dropped on Afghanistan, are just distractions from the growing Russia scandal? Considering the fact that he won t say whether he actually authorized the MOAB strike, it s not too far-fetched to wonder if this was to distract us from news that our intelligence community may have concrete information showing his campaign colluded with Russia during the election.But the MOAB we just dropped on Afghanistan may not be all. Trump is threatening North Korea, too, in a more direct way than saying,  See my giant penis bomb? You shouldn t mess with me. We already sent a strike force across the Pacific to intimidate Kim Jong Un, who s been shooting missiles into the Sea of Japan lately. North Korea is now talking about conducting a nuclear test within the next few days, and the Trump administration has threatened to hit them with Tomahawks if they do so.But that s not all   there may well be an attempt to get  boots on the ground  in North Korea as well:The intelligence officials told NBC News that the U.S. has positioned two destroyers capable of shooting Tomahawk cruise missiles in the region, one just 300 miles from the North Korean nuclear test site.American heavy bombers are also positioned in Guam to attack North Korea should it be necessary, and earlier this week, the Pentagon announced that the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier strike group was being diverted to the area.The U.S. strike could include missiles and bombs, cyber and special operations on the ground.Because that s totally the way to cow a foreign power. North Korea has warned that if we launch a pre-emptive strike against them, they could launch a nuke at us. Hot air? Maybe. But it would be better for Trump to take it seriously than strut around with his penis peacock feathers on full display right up until they actually do it.If dropping the biggest non-nuclear bomb in our arsenal isn t enough to scare them, then nothing will be. If we launch missiles at North Korea in a pre-emptive strike for a nuclear test, we ve committed an act of war, and no matter how we justify it, we ve made ourselves a threat to the entire world by provoking a nuclear power.And North Korea may or may not retaliate directly against us. While they ve threatened to  hit the U.S. first,  with a nuke should we strike, they might decide to hit South Korea, or even Japan, in retaliation for such an attack. In fact, Japan is worried that North Korea could send missiles tipped with sarin gas warheads their way. Sarin gas is the gas that Assad used on his people last week.In other words, Trump s aggressive actions have consequences he doesn t seem to understand. He s a macho peacock strutting around trying to convince the world that he s a bad-ass with a giant penis military at his disposal. Our military is not a toy, and bombs are not a toy, and neither are signals of strength in the situations in which Trump is using them. He needs to go. He s the biggest threat to the world we ve seen in decades.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",Fake
"White House says Trump to sign broadband privacy repeal WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump plans to sign a repeal of Obama-era broadband privacy rules as a bigger fight looms over rules governing the openness of the internet, the White House said on Wednesday. Republicans in Congress on Tuesday narrowly passed the repeal of the privacy rules with no Democratic support and over the strong objections of privacy advocates. The fight over privacy sets the stage for an even larger battle later this year over Republican plans to overturn the net neutrality provisions adopted by the administration of former President Barack Obama in 2015. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said he did not know when Trump would sign the bill. The privacy bill would repeal regulations adopted in October by the Federal Communications Commission under the Obama administration requiring internet service providers to do more to protect customersâ€™ privacy than websites like Alphabet Incâ€™s Google or Facebook Inc. Under the rules, internet providers would need to obtain consumer consent before using precise geolocation, financial information, health information, childrenâ€™s information and web browsing history for advertising and marketing. The reversal is a win for AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc. Websites are governed by a less restrictive set of privacy rules overseen by the Federal Trade Commission. Republican commissioners have said the rules would unfairly give websites the ability to harvest more data than internet service providers.  Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said in a tweet the vote was â€œTerrible for American ppl, great for big biz.â€ Republicans next plan to overturn net neutrality provisions that in 2015 reclassified broadband providers and treated them like a public utility.     FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, a Republican, in December said he believes that net neutralityâ€™s days are numbered. The rules bar internet providers from obstructing or slowing down consumer access to web content and prohibit giving or selling access to speedy internet, essentially a â€œfast laneâ€ on the webâ€™s information superhighway, to certain internet services. Critics say the rules opened the door to potential government rate regulation, tighter oversight and would provide fewer incentives to invest billions in broadband infrastructure. Pai told Reuters in February be backs â€œa free and open internet and the only question is what regulatory framework best secures thatâ€ but has steadfastly declined to disclose his plans.  Trump has not talked as president about net neutrality but in 2014 tweeted he opposed net neutrality. ",Real

Senator Patrick Leahy, the senior Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, and Senator Jeanne Shaheen, the senior Democrat on a panel overseeing the Justice Department, made the request in a letter. They sought â€œdetails of any request for increased resources made by the FBI to DOJâ€ and â€œhow this request was communicated from the FBI to DOJ, and whether similar requests were made to the White House.â€ A congressional source with knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday that Comey told lawmakers within the past few days he had asked the Justice Department to make additional resources available - mainly more staffing - for the Russia probe. Trump fired Comey on Tuesday.  ",Real
"White House tax reform may begin in late spring: Spicer DUBLIN (Reuters) - President Donald Trump may begin his overhaul of the U.S. tax code as early as late spring, White House spokesman Sean Spicer has told Irelandâ€™s Sunday Independent newspaper.  â€œWe are going to have tax reform after we get healthcare completed... I think we are looking at late spring to summer,â€ Spicer told the newspaper in an interview during Irish Prime Minister Enda Kennyâ€™s visit to Washington late last week.  Trump has vowed to deliver major tax cuts to the middle-class and the business community this year but deepening Republican divisions over a House Republican healthcare bill which has spawned concern that action on tax reform may be delayed.

"U.S. appeals court rejects Trump's bid to bar most refugees NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Thursday rejected the Trump administrationâ€™s effort to temporarily bar most refugees from entering the country, ruling that those who have relationships with a resettlement agency should be exempt from an executive order banning refugees.  A three-judge 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel also  ruled that grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins of legal U.S. residents should be exempted from President Donald Trumpâ€™s order, which banned travelers from six Muslim-majority countries. The ruling is the latest legal blow to the Presidentâ€™s sweeping executive order barring travelers from Iran, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen for 90 days, which the Republican president said was necessary for national security. The Justices said that the government did not persuasively explain why the travel ban should be enforced against close relatives of people from the six countries or refugees with guarantees from resettlement agencies. The 3-0 ruling takes effect in five days. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June that Trumpâ€™s ban could be implemented on a limited basis, but should not be applied to people with â€œbona fideâ€ relationships to people or entities in the United States.  The government took a narrow view of that interpretation, which the state of Hawaii challenged in court. A lower court judge sided with Hawaii, and the 9th Circuit judges upheld that view.  â€œIt is hard to see how a grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, sibling-in-law, or cousin can be considered to have no bona fide relationship with their relative in the United States,â€ the court said.  The court also rejected the administrationâ€™s argument that the written assurances provided by resettlement agencies obligating them to provide services for specific refugees is not a bona fide relationship.  The agenciesâ€™ advance preparation and expenditure of resources for each refugee â€œsupports the district courtâ€™s determination that a bona fide relationship with the refugee exists,â€ the decision said. Trumpâ€™s first version of the executive order, signed in January, sparked protests and chaos at airports around the country and the world before it was blocked by courts. The administration replaced that version of the ban with a new order in March in response to the legal challenges. A Department of Justice spokeswoman said: â€œThe Supreme Court has stepped in to correct these lower courts before, and we will now return to the Supreme Court to vindicate the Executive Branchâ€™s duty to protect the Nation.â€ Hawaiiâ€™s Attorney General Douglas Chin said the ruling â€œkeeps families together. It gives vetted refugees a second chance. The Trump administration keeps taking actions with no legal basis. We will keep fighting back.â€ Refugee organizations cheered Thursdayâ€™s decision, saying it will give relief to people fleeing violence who were caught in limbo after the ban. The broader question of whether the revised travel ban discriminates against Muslims in violation of the U.S. Constitution will be considered by the U.S. Supreme Court in October. ",Real
" Comrade Trump Pushes Conspiracy Theory From Russian Propaganda Site The ties between Donald Trump s presidential campaign and the regime of Russian leader Vladimir Putin have been extensive and troubling as they ve been revealed over the course of the campaign. Trump has repeatedly praised Putin, despite his invasion of Ukraine and his belligerent attitude on the international stage, including his support of Syrian dictator Assad.In exchange, Putin has also had nice words for Trump, and it is believed that Russia is backing hackers who have attacked  Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party.Now Trump has escalated the back and forth by promoting a delusional conspiracy theory that began on Russian propaganda websites. From CNN:Trump didn t cite a source to back up his claim, but the most recent report alleging this came from Sputnik News, a Russian state-owned news agency. Google search engine was suppressing the bad news about Hillary Clinton,  Trump said, apparently referring to Google searches during the first presidential debate on Monday night.Trump s remarks Wednesday night came two weeks after Sputnik News, a Russian government-controlled news agency, published a report claiming that Google search results are biased in Clinton s favor. Conservative news outlets, including Breitbart News, whose chairman became Trump s campaign CEO last month, linked to the report.Trump has surrounded his campaign with conspiracy theorists, including radio host Alex Jones, who is an ardent Trump supporter and who believes that the 9/11 terrorist attacks were an  inside job  executed by the U.S. government. Jones also believes that the children murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary were  crisis actors. There is no truth to Trump s claim about Google, and it is very possible he got the information from Jones, who has alleged that he is in phone contact with Trump.Trump s supporters ate up the claim, as a majority of them visit and believe the same propaganda false stories as their leader does.Featured image via Wikimedia Commons",Fake
" REPORT: Paranoid Trump Forces Cabinet Members To Only Hire People â€˜Loyalâ€™ To Him Donald Trump is employing extra scrutiny to anyone his Cabinet hires to guarantee that they are loyal only to him.As he continues to whine about Democrats holding up the confirmation process for his nominees, Trump is frustrating his Cabinet members by forcing them to clear all new hires with former campaign staffers because he is paranoid that they may not be loyal to him. New hires are apparently being subjected to rigorous vetting, and if it is found that they ever criticized Trump in any way, they are dismissed.According to Politico,When an informal adviser to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos recently recommended a candidate for a high-level Senate-confirmed position at the agency, the adviser was told that the candidate had little chance of getting the job because the person had previously worked for an organization that was seen as being at odds with Trump s policy positions, one person familiar with the issue said.The same goes for the Treasury Department.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has clashed with White House officials over top officials in his department, sources say. The White House saw some of Mnuchin s picks as too liberal or not supportive enough of Trump, sources say.Even Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has had to deal with Trump s paranoia.Several high-level people were delayed or scuttled because they didn t agree with Trump during the campaign or because the White House preferred someone else.Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson has also felt Trump s wrath.At Housing and Urban Development, Shermichael Singleton, a top official, joined the department before being terminated when criticism of Trump surfaced in a final White House review.So Trump is literally firing anyone who criticizes him or has criticized him in the past, which means he isn t interested in diverse opinions or experience. He just wants a bunch of yes-men who agree with him no matter what, even if he is wrong.That s incredibly dangerous because Trump is in a job where dissenting opinions can be the difference between life and death, or war and peace. Even President Obama nominated Republicans to high-level positions and valued their input. The greatest presidents in history put together administrations that included some of their sharpest critics because they wanted differing opinions and perspectives that would help them make the best decisions. All Trump is doing is creating his own echo chamber.And because of Trump s obsession with total control and absolute loyalty, the various executive departments are very understaffed. Furthermore, Trump s insistence on scrutinizing every employee hired has apparently slowed down his own job to nominate people to positions as well. So far, he has only managed to pick less than 36 nominees to fill Senate-confirmed positions. There are over 550 such positions that need to be filled.Adding to Trump s problems is the fact that many potential hires are backing out of taking positions because they know associating themselves with Trump could ruin their reputations and careers, which is another reason why Trump is only seeking friends for positions. But Matt Sclapp, who worked for George W. Bush as his political director, correctly warned that only installing friends into government positions can seriously backfire. It often breaks down into trying to appoint your allies into jobs and that can lead to a lot of bad policy formulations,  he said.Indeed, while nominating some qualified friends is not a big deal, Trump is more interested in blind loyalty than he is in qualifications. Nominating only friends to important positions can lead to scandal, especially if those friends start using their positions to enrich themselves or give themselves government favors.Donald Trump s administration is a train wreck, and chaos and infighting reigns inside the White House as he continues to embarrass himself and the nation. Now, even his own Cabinet members are beginning to get frustrated with him, and one wonders who will be the first to resign because they have an incompetent paranoid asshole for a boss.Featured image by Mario Tama via Getty Images",Fake
"Trump's voter fraud panel to meet as U.S. states' refusals mount WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trumpâ€™s commission to investigate possible election fraud will convene this month, a government notice said on Friday, as more U.S. states have refused to hand over at least some voter data. Trump created the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity in May, after claiming without evidence that millions of people voted illegally for his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, in the 2016 election. U.S. civil rights groups and Democratic lawmakers have called the panel a voter suppression tactic by Trump, a Republican who won the presidential election by securing a majority in the Electoral College tally of delegates even as he lost the popular vote to Clinton by some 3 million votes. The Electronic Privacy Information Center, a watchdog group, has filed a lawsuit to block the commissionâ€™s data request until its privacy impact can be weighed. A hearing in the case was scheduled for Friday afternoon. There is a wide consensus among state officials from both parties and election experts that voter fraud is rare. States rejecting the commissionâ€™s attempts to gather voter information have called it unnecessary and a violation of privacy. Most U.S. states have rejected full compliance with the commissionâ€™s requests. Republican Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, the commissionâ€™s vice chairman, said in a statement sent by the White House that 14 states and Washington, D.C., had rejected the request outright.   The commission will meet on July 19 to swear in members, formulate objectives and discuss next steps after asking the 50 states to turn over potentially sensitive voter information, according to a General Services Administration (GSA) notice published in the Federal Register. A June 28 letter from the election panel sought names, the last four digits of Social Security numbers, addresses, birth dates, political affiliations, felony convictions and voting histories. Matthew Dunlap, Maineâ€™s Democratic secretary of state and a commission member, on Friday dismissed Trumpâ€™s claim that millions of voters illegally cast ballots. â€œWe just donâ€™t see that,â€ he told CNN. â€œPeople are incredibly law abiding.â€ Although Maine is one state that has pushed back at the commissionâ€™s request, Dunlap said he hopes the panel can tackle voting issues including ballot access and hacking. A Republican commission member, former Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell, defended the panel, telling CNN on Thursday that fraud with even â€œone vote per precinct ... can change the course of history.â€ A court filing in the Electronic Privacy Information Center case also showed the panel plans to house data on White House computers rather than at the GSA. The Washington Post, which earlier reported the filing, noted GSA would be required to follow specific privacy requirements. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Moscow tried to tilt the election in Trumpâ€™s favor. Moscow has dismissed the accusations. Trump has denied any collusion and has questioned the agenciesâ€™ conclusion as well as any Russian role. ",Real
"Trump declares Obamacare 'dead,' urges Democratic help for short-term fix WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday declared Obamacare â€œdeadâ€ and â€œgone,â€ but urged Republicans and Democrats in Congress to craft a short-term fix of healthcare markets under the 7-year-old law that critics say he has effectively sabotaged. â€œItâ€™s dead. Itâ€™s gone. Itâ€™s no longer - you shouldnâ€™t even mention. Itâ€™s gone,â€ Trump said of former Democratic President Barack Obamaâ€™s signature 2010 healthcare law that Republicans have repeatedly tried and failed to repeal. Speaking to reporters at the White House, Trump said: â€œI think weâ€™ll have a short-term fix with Republicans and Democrats getting together.â€ Trump also said he would work to lower prescription drug prices, which he said were â€œout of control.â€ He did not provide details. Last week, the Republican president said he would stop Obamacareâ€™s federal subsidy payments to insurers, which are designed to help lower-income people afford health insurance. Trump said that in stopping the subsidies, he was cutting off the â€œgravy trainâ€ for insurers. But Democrats and some Republicans said Trumpâ€™s move to cancel the payments would hurt poor and middle-class people and cause premiums to soar. Democratic attorneys general from 18 states as well as Washington, D.C., filed a lawsuit in federal court in California on Friday to preserve the payments.      Trump vowed during his 2016 presidential campaign to kill Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, but his fellow Republicans in Congress have been unable to pass legislation to replace it with a more limited healthcare program. Republicans call Obamacare intrusive and ineffective. Democrats defend the law, saying it extended health insurance to millions of Americans. Trump said his goal was to make healthcare more affordable and â€œthatâ€™s what we are doingâ€ by encouraging a bipartisan short-term fix followed by a Republican-only long-term program to be enacted during the first part of next year. It was not yet clear whether the Republican-controlled Congress would agree to help shore up Obamacare and reinstate the subsidies. Congress is already grappling with a crowded agenda that includes tax reform and paying for relief efforts for Californiaâ€™s wildfires and hurricanes that hit Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said he was hopeful that a deal was near to stabilize Obamacare. â€œIf heâ€™s (Trump) now supportive of an agreement that stabilizes and improves the existing system under the Affordable Care Act, we certainly welcome that change of heart,â€ Schumer said in a statement. Republican Senator Lamar Alexander and Democratic Senator Patty Murray have been trying to craft a bipartisan deal aimed at helping stabilize health insurance markets under Obamacare. Speaking to reporters on Monday, Alexander said: â€œI hope we can get a result,â€ but added that any deal he crafted with Murray would have to win the support of rank-and-file senators. He said he and Murray were trying to strike a deal that â€œextends cost-sharing payments for two years and gives states meaningful flexibilityâ€ in administering Obamacare.  ",Real
" WATCH: Kellyanne Conway Pathetically Begs People To Buy Ivanka Trumpâ€™s Products On Fox News Donald Trump is clearly using the office of the presidency to enrich himself and his family, a clear violation of the Constitution.In January, the retailer Nordstrom informed Ivanka Trump of their decision to drop her product line from their stores. A boycott of Ivanka s products and any retailer who sells them contributed to the decision. That s the way the free market works.But after the decision became public earlier this week Trump lost his shit over it on Wednesday.My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person   always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017Nordstrom responded by announcing that the decision was made purely for business reasons and that Ivanka was informed last month and understood the choice they made. Since then, Nordstrom s stock has risen and other retailers have also dropped Ivanka s products.And so, Donald Trump sent Kellyanne Conway on Fox News on Thursday to give free advertising to Ivanka s business. They are using the most prominent woman in Donald Trump s life,  Conway began.  Using her, who has been a champion for empowerment of women in the workplace, to get to him. I think she s gone from 800 stores to a thousand stores, or a thousand places where you can buy. You can buy her goods online,  she continued before literally telling Fox viewers to go buy her products. Go buy Ivanka s stuff is what I would tell you. I hate shopping, I m going to go get some myself today. This is just wonderful line. I own some of it. I fully   I m going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody. You can find it online. Here s the video via YouTube.Seriously. Kellyanne Conway actually shilled for Ivanka s products during an interview. This is not only an unconstitutional conflict of interest, it s completely unfair. Trump is literally using his platform to advertise his daughter s business, a business she was supposedly going to walk away from because she joined Trump s White House team. Clearly, she lied just like her daddy did.The fact that Conway appeared on Fox to advertise for the Trumps demonstrates that Donald Trump only sees the presidency as a way to enrich himself and his family. He doesn t give a damn about the economy or foreign policy or any other problems we face. He only cares about personal profit and this is proof of his selfishness.Featured Image: Yana Paskova/Getty Images",Fake
" Trump Just Waved His Magic Wand And Made Major Information On Climate Change Disappear (IMAGES) The White House s official website used to have lengthy pages on several topics, including climate change, the ACA, LGBTQ rights and civil rights, among other things. The instant the clock struck noon in Washington, though, Trump and his admin furiously began scrubbing the site of pretty much everything they don t like.Obama once had a very long and detailed page dedicated exclusively to fighting climate change, which is an issue that s growing in importance. 2015 was once the hottest year on record. Now 2016 is the hottest year on record. In other words, the planet is heating faster and faster, according to real science, but Trump and his administration still seem to think climate change is either a hoax, or it s a nuisance to be destroyed.Otherwise Trump wouldn t have appointed Scott Pruitt, a lying climate denier as head of the EPA, which he also happens to be suing (or was).Scientists have been scrambling to preserve as much government climate data as possible in recent weeks, downloading everything to a network of servers in Canada where Herr Trump can t touch it. And now their fears that Trump wants to squash talk of man-made climate change are starting to play out.Trump s only mention of anything having to do with the environment is his  America First Energy Plan.  That plan is committed to rolling back EPA rules and expanding fossil fuel operations because that s obviously the magic bullet we need for jobs, energy growth and the environment (the truth was spoken by a coal miner who, on Dec. 22, blasted any ideas that we can actually bring coal jobs back to coal country to smithereens).Where once there was a fount of information, a search for  climate change,   global warming,  and anything along those lines on the White House s site suddenly reveals a whole lot of nothing.  It s completely normal for whitehouse.gov to change rapidly with an incoming administration, but it doesn t appear to be customary to scrub all references to absolutely everything the incoming administration has been sneering at the whole time.Motherboard s Jason Koebler made this all the more ominous by saying: Scientists I ve spoken to who are archiving websites say they expect scientific data on the NASA, NOAA, Department of Energy, and EPA websites to be neglected or deleted eventually. They say they don t expect agency sites to be updated immediately, but expect it to play out over the course of months. This sort of low-key data destruction might not be the type of censorship people typically think about, but scientists are treating it as such. Do we really have to wonder whether Trump will try and censor all climate change information everywhere? No, we really do not.Featured image by Alex Wong via Getty Images",Fake

"Trump hits back at Clinton, with a golf ball, on Twitter WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday retweeted a doctored video of himself taking a golf swing and hitting former Democratic presidential rival Hillary Clinton, who then stumbles as she boards a plane. Clinton had been back on the Republican presidentâ€™s Twitter feed in recent days as she promoted â€œWhat Happened,â€ her new book about the 2016 presidential election, with Trump resuming his campaign attack of â€œCrooked Hillary.â€ The video, retweeted by several users, shows Trump on a golf course hitting a ball before segueing to the doctored shot of a golf ball hitting then-Secretary of State Clinton in the back as she is boarding a plane. The original video of Clinton, from 2011, does not show a golf ball. â€œDonald Trumpâ€™s amazing golf swing #CrookedHillary,â€ the tweet read.  Trump attacked Clinton directly last Wednesday in a pair of Twitter posts. â€œCrooked Hillary Clinton blames everybody (and every thing) but herself for her election loss,â€ he said. â€œShe lost the debates and lost her direction! The â€˜deplorablesâ€™ came back to haunt Hillary. They expressed their feelings loud and clear. She spent big money but, in the end, had no game!â€ White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said later that day that Clinton was pushing â€œfalse narrativesâ€ in the book. Clinton admits mistakes during the campaign in the book but gives a harsh account of factors she believes led to Trumpâ€™s victory, including alleged interference by Russia on his behalf and former FBI Director James Comey announcement that investigators were looking at a new trove of emails related to Clinton. Clinton, who has been giving a series of interviews promoting the book, responded to Trumpâ€™s earlier criticism on Twitter with a suggestion that he read her earlier book, â€œIt Takes a Village,â€ a picture book for children. A senior Democrat, U.S. Representative Adam Schiff, said the retweet did not make him question Trumpâ€™s recent outreach to Democrats but was disturbing. â€œIt is distressing, though, to have a president that frankly will tweet and retweet things as juvenile as that,â€ Schiff said on ABCâ€™s â€œThis Weekâ€ program. â€œIt doesnâ€™t help, I think in terms of his stature, it doesnâ€™t help in terms of the stature of our whole country.â€ ",Real

" Even Back In 1993, Donald Trump Was Getting Shut Down With His Nazi Bullsh*t In any other administration, this would be absolute gold. Every opposition player hopes to find some evidence of a politician acting like a complete jackass at some time in the past. They can use it in campaign ads, or even better, to keep someone from getting elected in the first place. That s not how it works with Donald Trump, though.Much like Greg Gianforte, the Montana congressman whose base turned out to elect him even better after he assaulted a reporter, Donald Trump was elected by people who wanted an asshole. After all, this is the man who famously claimed he could  stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn t lose voters.  His voters have never proved him wrong on that. He has consistently been just one of the worst humans ever to walk the planet in every way, and his base is still as fervent as the day they vaulted their racist, sexist, xenophobic, homophobic asshole into power.This video is not for them, though.

" Even Robert E. Lee Didnâ€™t Want Confederate Monuments To â€˜Keep Open The Sores Of Warâ€™ Almost three years ago, a history buff and biographer of Robert E. Lee, Jonathan Horn, wrote a book that provided a different perspective of the Confederate general. The book, titled The Man Who Would Not Be Washington, recalled a history of Lee that many casual readers don t know, and one that many fans like to whitewash. With all of Donald Trump s ridiculous comparisons between Lee and the father of our country, it s easy to overlook that the southern leader was the son of a man who d served Washington in the Revolutionary War like nearly no other.In fact, Lee s father,  Light Horse Harry,  gave the eulogy at George Washington s funeral:First in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen.In death, only the best things are remembered. There was no urban legend about Washington s  wooden teeth  while he was alive. He provided for the liberation of his own slaves in his will. His last words, after the valiant efforts of doctors to save him, were  Tis well.  Washington was a complex man, and his legacy would only unpack years after his passing.The same can be said of the eulogist s son. When the most famous Confederate looked at secession before the Civil War, he was disdainful:The framers of our Constitution never exhausted so much labour, wisdom and forbearance in its formation   if it was intended to be broken by every member of the Confederacy at will.Lee eventually resigned his commission in the Union Army. He joined his home state of Virginia in taking up arms in rebellion, and like many of the conservatives of today, he fudged on his history, insisting that he d always favored leaving the United States. But his complexity, unpacked after his death, is most compelling in looking at his view of remembrance.Robert E. Lee never wanted monuments or memorials to the Civil War.Some of the history of Lee s re-change of heart is well-known: Upon his surrender, he vowed to support the U.S. Constitution  henceforth,  and commanded his followers to do the same. But many wanted to honor Lee s service to the South with statues and memorials. Lee rebuffed them:As regards the erection of such a monument as is contemplated, my conviction is, that, however grateful it would be to the feelings of the South, the attempt, in the present condition of the country, would have the effect of retarding instead of accelerating its accomplishment, and of continuing if not adding to the difficulties under which the Southern people labor.Robert E. Lee understood then what many still do not get today: That the flags of wars past serve nothing but to fight those wars over again in our minds. He was adamant:I think it wiser moreover not to keep open the sores of war, but to follow the examples of those nations who endeavoured to obliterate the marks of civil strife and to commit to oblivion the feelings it engendered.Now, I personally am not a historian. But early America has always been a passion of mine   My great-great-great-great-great grandfather is buried in Calais, Vermont, his service in the Revolutionary War inscribed on his headstone. It should likewise at least serve as instruction for those who would fawn over its legends. Many symbols exist today commemorating the Confederacy, especially in Virginia, Lee s own state.But if you want to honor Robert E. Lee, honor the fact that he never wanted to see you waving a Confederate flag.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",Fake
"Who are Paul Manafort and Rick Gates? WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Paul Manafort, a businessman and longtime Republican Party operative, surrendered on Monday to the Federal Bureau of Investigation to face the first charges produced by a special counsel investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Manafort and his associate Rick Gates were indicted by a federal grand jury. The 12-count indictment included conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to launder money, being an unregistered agent of a foreign principal, making false and misleading statements and seven counts of failure to file reports of foreign banks and financial accounts. Both pleaded not guilty to the charges. The Kremlin has denied it meddled in the election campaign to try to tilt the vote in Trumpâ€™s favor. Trump has denied any collusion by his campaign. Who is Paul Manafort? Manafort is a veteran Republican operative who has worked as a Washington lobbyist and international political consultant. His former clients include authoritarian leaders such as the late Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines and Russian and Ukrainian businessmen and politicians. Manafort was a campaign manager for the Trump campaign in the summer of 2016.     What does the indictment charge they did? The indictment against Manafort and Gates says they both generated tens of millions of dollars of income from Ukraine work and laundered money through scores of U.S. and foreign entities to hide payments from U.S. authorities between 2006 and through at least 2016.  In June, Manafort and Gates retroactively registered with the Justice Department as foreign agents, in a Foreign Agents Registration Act filing that showedÂ they earned $17.1 million for lobbying on behalf of the Party of Regions, a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine, between 2012 and 2014. The indictment said they concealed from the United States their work and revenue as agents of Ukrainian political parties. They used their wealth to lead a â€œlavish lifestyleâ€ without paying taxes on the income, prosecutors said. The indictment says that more than $75 million flowed through Manafortâ€™s and Gatesâ€™ offshore accounts. Manafort, the indictment said, laundered more than $18 million. The indictment also alleges Manafort and Gates, along with others, conspired to defraud the United States by â€œimpeding, impairing, obstructing, and defeating the lawful governmental functionsâ€ of the Department of Justice and the Treasury Department between 2006 and 2017. Manafort was indicted on nine counts and Gates was indicted on eight counts. What are Manafortâ€™s links to Trump?  Manafort joined the Trump presidential campaign in March 2016 and later became campaign manager, but he was forced to resign in August as questions emerged about his previous work for the political party of the Kremlin-backed former Ukrainian president, Viktor Yanukovich.  Business Insider reported that Manafort and Trump have been connected since the 1980s, when Trump hired Manafortâ€™s lobbying firm to help the Trump Organization.  In 2006, Manafort and his wife bought an apartment in Trump Tower in New York, which Manafort still owns and where he lives when he is in Manhattan, Business Insider reported. How do the charges relate to Trump? â€œIt has nothing to do with the campaign or the allegations of collusion with Russia,â€ said Washington attorney John Dowd, who represents Trump in the Russia probe. A Trump confidante said: â€œAs it relates to the president, this is nothing. All of the 12 counts of the indictment that came down today, all of it predates their tenure at the campaign.â€ The special counselâ€™s indictment says Manafort and Gates laundered the money through â€œscores of United States and foreign corporations, partnerships and bank accountsâ€ from approximately 2006 through â€œat least 2016.â€ Who is Rick Gates? Rick Gates was Manafortâ€™s deputy and business associate. According to two former high-level Trump staffers, Gates essentially functioned as the Trump campaign manager for more than two months, all while not collecting a paycheck. The New York Times reported in June that the Trump transition team had been ordered to preserve materials related to ongoing investigations into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. According to the Times, the memo from the special counselâ€™s office to the former transition team also sought specific information on five people including Manafort and Gates. According to the indictment, between at least 2006 and 2015 Manafort and Gates acted as unregistered agents of the Ukrainian government, a Ukrainian political party that was headed by Ukraineâ€™s then president, Yanukovich, and Yanukovich himself. The indictment said they both generated tens of millions of dollars in income as a result of their Ukraine work.  Yanukovich has been living in exile in Russia since he was ousted by mass street protests in Kiev in 2014. His departure lit the fuse for Moscowâ€™s annexation of Crimea and a separatist uprising in mainly Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine. The indictment said Gates aided Manafort in obtaining money from offshore accounts and that Gates used that money to pay for personal expenses including â€œhis mortgage, childrenâ€™s tuition, and interior decorating of his Virginia residence.â€  How significant is Gatesâ€™ arrest? The indictment lays out the extent of Gatesâ€™ involvement with Manafort going back years. That could potentially open the door for Gates to testify against Manafort and others in the future. David Sklansky, a professor Â at Stanford Law School and former federal prosecutor, said Gates could feel pressure to cooperate and provide testimony against Trump. ",Real
"U.S. lawmaker Scalise improving after baseball field shooting WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Representative Steve Scalise, the No. 3 House Republican, has shown improvement in the past 36 hours after being shot by a man who opened fire on Republican lawmakers at a baseball practice earlier in the week, his lead surgeon said on Friday. â€œThe congressmanâ€™s status remains critical,â€ Dr. Jack Sava, the director of trauma at the MedStar Washington Hospital Center, told reporters. â€œAn excellent recovery is a good possibility.â€ Scalise, 51, sustained injuries to internal organs, broken bones and severe bleeding after being shot in his left hip on Wednesday morning on a baseball field in a Washington suburb. Scalise had been at â€œimminent risk of deathâ€ when he was first brought into the hospital on Wednesday, and he received many units of transfused blood, Sava said. The congressmanâ€™s risk of death was now substantially lower because doctors have controlled the bleeding and his vital signs have stabilized. Scalise, who has had two surgeries, will need additional operations and will be in the hospital for â€œa considerable period of time, presumably weeks,â€ Sava said. Because the bullet shattered, there may be hundreds of fragments in Scaliseâ€™s body and doctors do not intend to try to remove them all, Sava said. He declined to describe specific internal injuries. Once recovered, Scalise will be able to walk and hopefully run, the doctor said. He said doctors have turned down Scaliseâ€™s sedation levels enough that he has been able to respond to visiting family members. Scalise, a police officer, a congressional aide and a lobbyist were wounded on Wednesday when a man identified as James Hodgkinson, 66, from the St. Louis suburb of Belleville, Illinois, opened fire on the lawmakers as they practiced for an annual charity baseball game between Republicans and Democrats. Hodgkinson died after being shot by police. A list of Republican lawmakers was found on Hodgkinsonâ€™s body, CBS News reported, citing an unidentified U.S. official. The list included Representatives Mo Brooks and Jeff Duncan, who were at the practice, and Representative Trent Franks, who was not, CBS said. The note was not considered an assassination list, the network said. The FBI declined to comment on the report. The U.S. Capitol Police and representatives for the three lawmakers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The FBI said that the shooterâ€™s weapons found at the scene - a 9mm handgun and 7.62mm caliber rifle - had been legally purchased. The FBI continues to process evidence in an effort to assess the potential motivations of the shooter, the agency said in a statement Friday. Hodgkinson had a history of posting angry messages against Trump and other Republicans on social media. Members of Congress took the field at Washingtonâ€™s Nationals Park on Thursday night for the charity baseball game, many wearing hats to honor Scalise, who has represented Louisiana in the House since 2008.

" Ron Paul Blames Obama For A Stock Market Crash That Hasnâ€™t Happened Yet Ron Paul, who s a retired doctor, not an economist, has a prediction that in the very near future, the stock market will lose half its value. Guess who would be to blame? Why it s the black guy, of course. A 50 percent pullback is conceivable,  Paul said on  Futures Now  recently.  I don t believe it s ten years off. I don t even believe it s a year off. According to his calculations, it would cut the S&P 500 Index in half, to 1212, and the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average would collapse to 10,837.Paul noted that there s a lot of chaos in Washington right now, with an  unpredictable president  and those who are inclined to  tear him apart  but if the market takes that big of a tumble, he doesn t see it as Trump s fault. It s all man-made. It s not the fault of Donald Trump in the last week. If the market crashes tomorrow and we have a great depression, he didn t do it in six months. It took more like six or ten years to cause all these problems that we re facing,  he said.Source: CNBCSix to 10 years ago, hmmm, who was in office for the vast majority of that time?Paul has spent much of his career as an economic doomsdayer, and sometimes it sounds like he s right, just because, well, broken clocks and all Two years ago, he predicted nearly the same collapse, but he had a solution, which could be anyone s for just $49.50   for sale on his website, of course.As part of an infomercial for Stansberry & Associates Investment Research, Ron Paul warned that a currency crisis  of epic proportions  would arrive soon and prophesied that life in America was  guaranteed to end in disaster  as  a total breakdown of the stock market  would lead to  civil unrest  and  authoritarian clampdowns.  Paul said people could avoid   and even benefit from   the collapse by purchasing Stansberry s  Survival Blueprint  for weathering the coming catastrophe for $49.50.Source: CNNThe only thing Ron Paul hates more than regulations and the Federal Reserve, is a more diverse society. He s a long-avowed racist who was never a fan of President Obama. In March, Paul s institute ran a blog post that accused Obama of sabotaging Trump.He s also a big believer in the  Deep State,  which is a shadow government that really runs the United States. According to another blog post, Obama is still part of that deep state.A 50 percent drop in the stock market would be disastrous for our economy, but as I mentioned, Paul is not an economist. He arguably predicted the real estate crash, but so did a lot of economists. Paul, like his buddy Alex Jones, is full of doomsday predictions and he has books to sell. If such a drop happens, you might be able to point fingers at some Obama policies, but it s Trump who s scaring the hell out of everyone, including investors. If we crash, Trump is driving the bus and he will get the blame   at least from most people.Featured image via Pete Marovich/Getty Images",Fake
"U.S. lawmakers gear up to block Trump plan to slash oil stockpile WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Trump administration plan to sell off half the U.S. emergency crude oil stockpile to help balance the budget faces opposition in Congress, with lawmakers from both parties worried the proposal would undermine the drilling industry and make the country vulnerable to supply shocks.  The White Houseâ€™s 2018 budget proposal, sent to Congress on Tuesday, proposes raising nearly $16.6 billion by 2027 by gradually selling millions of barrels from the reserve, which now holds about 688 million barrels of oil in underground caverns in Texas and Louisiana. News of the proposal had briefly sent oil prices tumbling on concern it would oversupply the market, but prices recovered and finished slightly higher on hopes that OPEC and other countries would extend supply cuts. Â Â Â Â â€œWe should not be selling oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve now,â€ said Senator John Hoeven, a Republican from North Dakota, a leading oil producer state. â€œWe should use the SPR for emergencies, and selling now would disrupt the markets.â€ The SPR sell-off plan is part of a broader White House proposal to balance the U.S. budget that is meant as starting point to debate policy with Congress - which will ultimately pass its own version.  Whether the SPR proposal will survive the budget process could depend in part on Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, a member of the appropriations committee and the head of the chamberâ€™s energy panel. In 2015, when Congress was considering selling a modest amount of oil from the reserve to help fund a transportation bill, Murkowski opposed the idea, saying the reserve should not be used as an ATM.  Murkowski did not directly address the SPR plan in a statement on Tuesday, but she said â€œa Presidentâ€™s budget is more of a vision than anything else.â€ Efforts to reach Murkowski on Tuesday were not successful. Â Â Â Â Murkowskiâ€™s Democratic counterpart on the energy panel, however, raised concerns that liquidating half of the reserve would run counter to the original purpose of the facility, which Congress created in 1975 to protect against global oil disruptions that could harm the U.S. economy.  Â Â Â Â â€œWe are not going to let Donald Trump auction off our energy security to the highest bidder,â€ Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington said in an email. The Arab oil embargo of the early 1970s led to chaos at U.S. filling stations and fears of long-term damage to the economy. Much has changed since then: U.S. oil production has surged in recent years and supply from Canada has increased, displacing a large portion of the imports from some less stable Middle Eastern suppliers. U.S. oil imports from the producer group OPEC have fallen to less than 3.2 million bpd in 2016 from more than 5.4 million barrels per day in 2008, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Richard Newell, a former head of the EIA, noted that the plan could cause the United States to break its obligation as a member of the International Energy Agency to hold 90 daysâ€™ worth of oil imports on reserve. Currently, the SPR holds about 145 daysâ€™ worth of oil imports.Â Â   â€œThere are a number of possible scenarios under which reducing the SPR to the levels proposed would violate our IEA treaty obligations,â€ he said.  Lawmakers from both parties also said releasing oil from the SPR could dampen crude prices and hurt drilling companies still recovering from a price crash in 2014. Trump had campaigned on a promise to revive the drilling industry. â€œPutting that much oil on the market, you will see a lot of layoffs in the energy business,â€ said Representative Gene Green, a Democrat from Texas.  Mick Mulvaney, the head of the Office of Management and Budget told reporters on Tuesday, however, there are ways to tap the SPR slowly and â€œtelegraph it over the course of timeâ€ to avoid having a dramatic impact on prices.  Representative Pete Olson, a Texas Republican, said the SPR infrastructure needs improvement because tanks and other equipment are constantly exposed to corrosive salt air. But he did not rush to embrace a sell-off of oil, saying that the larger budget deserves careful scrutiny. Some oil industry representatives also came out against the proposal. Randall Luthi, President of the National Ocean Industries Association said the plan to cut the SPR in half threatened national security. He added he also opposed a proposal in the budget to cut federal oil royalty payments to U.S. Gulf Coast states - funds meant to help them defend their coasts from hurricane damage. ",Real

" Andrea Tantaros Just Buried Fox News With Sworn Affidavit From A Professional Therapist Fox News needs to take Andrea Tantaros  sexual harassment lawsuit seriously because she refuses to back down.The conservative network has repeatedly belittled Tantaros and called her a liar ever since she slapped Fox News with a sexual harassment lawsuit naming Roger Ailes and Bill O Reilly.Tantaros has even dared her former Fox employers to take a lie detector test, even offering to take one herself because she has nothing to hide. But now Tantaros has some serious reinforcements who can back up her sexual harassment claims.As it turns out, the former host of Outnumbered was distraught enough about the demeaning working environment at Fox News that she saw a professional therapist starting in 2014 to deal with how she was constantly being treated by Fox bigwigs.Dr. Michele Berdy has now written a sworn affidavit confirming that Tantaros spoke with her about how Ailes would tell her to wear tighter dresses and how he would demand her to stand up and turn around so he could ogle her. Tantaros also told Berdy about Bill O Reilly s unwanted advances and how Fox PR chief Bill Shine ordered her to not file complaints about Ailes  behavior.Berdy wrote that after reading reports about Fox denying the claims, she reached out to Tantaros and gave her support. Over the course of many months (2014   2016), Andrea relayed to me on multiple occasions instances of Mr. Ailes s demeaning and overtly predatory behavior, as well as the abusive conduct of Fox News s public relations department,  Berdy wrote.Berdy confirmed that Tantaros spoke to her repeatedly about how she sought help from Bill Shine to make the harassment stop but he did nothing except basically tell Tantaros to just let it happen and allow Ailes to continue harassing her. In addition, Berdy confirmed Tantaros  claim that Ailes retaliated against her for refusing to comply with his sexual demands.Berdy also backed up Tantaros  story of how O Reilly approached her on multiple occasions to invite her to a private beach house, which he did because he had heard that she is  wild. Here are images of parts of the affidavit via Twitter.This is a pretty damning affidavit against Fox News, which has already had to make a pretty hefty payment to former host Gretchen Carlson over her own sexual harassment lawsuit against Ailes.The fact that Tantaros had to see a therapist to deal with the constant abuse at her workplace and that her complaints were documented long before she filed the lawsuit bring even more credibility and sympathy to her story.It s time for Fox News to clean house and fire the people who are responsible for covering for Ailes and it s time to fire anyone who sexually harassed female employees at the network, including Bill O Reilly and even Steve Doocy, whom Carlson named in her lawsuit.Fox News thinks they can bully Tantaros and make her lawsuit go away. But she isn t backing down and it s only getting worse for Fox the longer this lawsuit plays out.Featured image via Dangerous Minds ",Fake
" Melania Just Liked A Tweet That Shows Just How Much She Hates Her Husband (DETAILS) There has long been speculation that Melania Trump cannot stand her husband. After all, Donald Trump is a bloviating, compulsive bully. If he bullies the rest of the world, chances are he does the same to his wife. What s to stop him? He likely controls her money and her access to her son. If she tried to speak out against him or leave him, she d lose both. Hell, he might even be able to get her deported.There s plenty of evidence out there that Melania is terrified of The Donald, but it seems she may be getting bolder. There is, thus far, absolutely no sign that she and her son, Barron, are planning to move to the White House. The only time we see them is at a few photo-ops, and when the family travels to Mar-a-Lago. She never says a word to the press, and has not executed any of the usual duties of a First Lady. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that Melania s official Twitter account liked a tweet that mocks Trump s border wall plan, saying that the only wall he s been able to build is between himself and his wife. Here is a screenshot of that particular like, in case someone pulls it down:Now, this is a pretty bold move for Melania, and kudos to her or whoever had the guts to do it. As much as Trump is on Twitter, it s likely he d see it, especially as it gets spread around the interwebs. Hopefully, he s too busy attacking political opponents, the free press, and anyone else who dares to criticize him to attack his own wife. Then again, knowing Trump, he won t be able to restrain himself.Melania, I hope you ve got good security after this one.

After all, Trump has been obsessed with nuclear weapons since the 2016 campaign and is mentally unstable enough that he may actually use them to retaliate against even the smallest personal slight against him.Hillary Clinton was right when she warned that,  A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. On Wednesday morning, Trump bragged about America s nuclear arsenal on his Twitter feed and promised that America would remain the most powerful nation on Earth because of it. He even had the audacity to claim that he is responsible for the renovation of the arsenal.My first order as President was to renovate and modernize our nuclear arsenal. It is now far stronger and more powerful than ever before .  Donald J.

So once again, Trump gets caught taking credit for something President Obama did.In addition, Donald Trump must not be aware that Russia has more nuclear weapons than the United States.And, finally, America s nuclear arsenal does not make us the most powerful nation in the world. It now makes us the number one threat against it because of Trump.Forcing Trump out of office has never been more important than it is right now.

They complained for days about the utter lack of respect shown toward Reagan. Of course, Reagan s inaction during the AIDS epidemic during his presidency understandably angers many people.However, two gay activists from Philadelphia is not the same as three people who are public figures. Nugent and Kid Rock are both musicians and Palin is a former vice-presidential candidate.As such, they are and should be held to a higher standard.Sarah Palin was invited to the White House by Donald Trump, who told her to bring some friends. For some reason, she chose Nugent, a man who shit his pants to avoid serving his country in Vietnam and later wrote an ode to pedophilia, and Robert Ritchie (Kid Rock), an alcoholic who has committed assault and battery and has a sex tape.Seriously, these people got to pal around in the Oval Office. It s disgraceful.But the trio did more than that. Instead of just acting like adults for the day, they decided to act like complete jackasses by mocking Hillary Clinton s White House portrait. Hillary Clinton has a White House portrait because she was the First Lady. And a classy First Lady at that, unlike Melania Trump, whom you can find nude photos of simply by running a search on Google.In the photo, Nugent holds his thumb out as if to say Clinton is  outta here  while Palin had a look of disgust on her face. Ritchie merely folded his arms across his chest in disdain.Here s the photo via Facebook:Of course, conservatives are cheering about this utter lack of disrespect even though they would have thrown a massive hissy fit had three liberal celebrities done the same to a portrait of a Republican First Lady.Most Americans, however, did not appreciate Palin and her friends  disrespect of a former First Lady.Again, Sarah Palin is a quitter and grifter who will never work in the White House. Ted Nugent is a racist who has a thing for underage girls. And Kid Rock is the poster boy for who the war on drugs should be waged against. Donald Trump degraded the White House by inviting these three losers to visit and he should be ashamed of himself for once again demonstrating why America is a laughingstock around the world.Featured Image: Facebook",Fake
"Traveling abroad, Trump struggles to escape crisis RIYADH (Reuters) - President Donald Trump was taking off on Air Force One when the latest bad news pinged into the inboxes of his besieged staff - a report that he had told Russian officials that fired FBI Director James Comey was â€œa nut jobâ€. Officials on board the Riyadh-bound presidential plane scrambled to coordinate with staff in Washington and those who had just landed in the Saudi capital for a response to the New York Times story about Comey. A second bombshell came from the Washington Post, which reported that a federal investigation about Russian contacts with the Trump campaign last year had reached a current White House official, who was not named. White House chief of staff Reince Priebus sought to play down the reports of disarray. Speaking to reporters on Air Force One, Priebus said Trump had spent the flight reading newspapers, meeting with national security advisers and other staff, getting briefed about the trip and getting a little sleep. But the sense of frustration was clear. Presidential aide Dan Scavino captured the mood of confrontation, seizing on a comment from Trumpâ€™s nemesis in the 2016 Republican presidential race, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who called Trump a â€œchaos presidentâ€ for all the bad headlines of late. Scavino fired back by reviving the derogatory nickname Trump had given Bush last year to raise doubts about his energy level and ultimately defeat him. â€œLOW ENERGY JEB is out of stock on Jebbity JEB Jebbers. Perhaps @RedBull or @MonsterEnergy could help out. Â¯\_( ãƒ„)_/Â¯â€ Scavino tweeted. Trumpâ€™s nine-day tour takes him to four countries. White House staffers, shell-shocked from the daily barrage of bad news, were soldiering on, trying to keep the focus on a trip that could bring some significant achievements. â€œWeâ€™re focused on that. The media will talk about what they talk about and people will get hysterical about what they get hysterical about but thereâ€™s a lot of people who are not focused on the day-to-day horse race and they are just making sure that the presidentâ€™s objectives are followed through on,â€ a senior aide told Reuters. It will be Trumpâ€™s longest time away from the White House since he took office on Jan. 20. He is joined on the trip by some aides who have squabbled in the past but who have sought to set aside their differences to try to advance the presidentâ€™s agenda, such as his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and senior strategist, Steve Bannon. Trumpâ€™s agenda has been sidetracked by the hubbub over his firing of Comey and the appointment of a special counsel to investigate the Russia ties. â€œI think this foreign trip is something theyâ€™re all looking forward to because it changes the narrative. It buys them a little time,â€ said a Republican close to the White House. While Trump has privately vented about his staff, the source doubted there would be a major staff shakeup in the near-term. The source said there might be some adjustments in the communications team to enable the White House to respond much more swiftly to the news. ",Real

"Senate quickens pace of approving Trump judicial picks WASHINGTON (Reuters) - One thing is definitely going right for U.S. President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans who control Congress: they are steadily getting conservatives appointed as judges, advancing their long-held ambition of reshaping the federal judiciary. So concern among conservatives arose after Democrats swept to victory in state and local elections in Virginia, New Jersey and elsewhere this month, signaling potential trouble for Republicans in the November 2018 mid-term elections in which control over Congress is at stake. If the partyâ€™s slim 52-48 majority in the Senate, which reviews and confirms federal judicial nominees, is at risk, Republicans may need to move even more quickly on getting judges confirmed by the Senate for their lifetime posts, some legal experts said. â€œObviously, who gets nominated and the pace of confirmations ... changes dramatically if the Senate were to flip back to the Democrats,â€ said John Malcolm, a former Justice Department lawyer and now an analyst at the Heritage Foundation conservative think tank in Washington. Republicans â€œshould be paying particular attention to pushing through as many nominees as they can,â€ added Malcolm, also active in the Federalist Society, a conservative lawyersâ€™ group whose members have frequently been tapped for judicial posts by Republican presidents.  Trump and congressional Republicans have not passed any major legislation since he took office in January despite controlling the White House and Congress. But after a slow start that had worried conservative activists, Republicans have made major headway on judicial appointments in recent weeks. The Senate has now voted to confirm 14 Trump judicial nominees, including Donald Coggins on Thursday as a district judge in South Carolina. That includes Supreme Court appointee Neil Gorsuch, eight others on regional appeals courts ranking just below the Supreme Court and five on trial courts. Obama had only seven confirmed at this point in his presidency. Democrats, who accused Republicans of impeding nominations from Trumpâ€™s Democratic predecessor Barack Obama, have said Republicans are trying to ram Trumpâ€™s nominees through the Senate, including some they say lack basic qualifications. Conservative groups that just last month were criticizing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for the pace of confirmations are now applauding him. McConnell, in a move with little precedent in U.S. history, last year refused to act on Obamaâ€™s nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court, paving the way for Trump to restore the high courtâ€™s conservative majority with Gorsuchâ€™s appointment. â€œWhen the history books are written about the Trump administration, I believe perhaps the most long-lasting and significant legacy will be the men and women appointed and confirmed to the federal bench,â€ Republican Senator Ted Cruz said at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday.  Trump has a unique opportunity to reshape the judiciary. He inherited more than 100 vacancies when he took office, twice the number Obama inherited. The number has since climbed above 160.  Trump generally has selected deeply conservative nominees, many in their 40s and 50s and able to serve for decades. He could name up to 30 percent of the federal bench in his first four-year term, said Leonard Leo, a Trump advisor on judicial nominations. Having a more conservative judiciary could be pivotal on legal disputes involving presidential powers, abortion, the death penalty, religious rights, gay rights, litigation involving corporations and other matters. The main impact of this infusion of conservative jurists will be to flip the ideological breakdown of several liberal-leaning federal appeals courts, said political scientist Sheldon Goldman, an expert in judicial selection at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.  Federal appeals courts, divided into 11 geographic regions plus two based in Washington, often have the final say in major legal disputes because the Supreme Court hears only a small number of cases annually.  During Wednesdayâ€™s Judiciary Committee hearing for six Trump judicial nominees, Democrats said Republicans were acting on too many too quickly, preventing proper questioning of the candidates. Trumpâ€™s appointees may be more reliably conservative than those of previous Republican presidents. Goldman said nearly all have a connection to the Federalist Society, providing a â€œvery consistent ideological vetting process.â€ Leo, the societyâ€™s executive vice president, helped compile a shortlist of Supreme Court nominees for Trump that included Gorsuch. Judges will be a focus of the societyâ€™s national convention that started on Thursday in Washington, with Trump selections including Gorsuch due to appear. While Republican lawmakers have been divided over legislation on issues including taxes and healthcare, judicial nominees are an issue on which tend to agree. â€œFixing Obamacare is no easy task,â€ said Carrie Severino, chief counsel of the Judicial Crisis Network conservative legal advocacy group, â€œwhereas the president has done such an excellent job of choosing nominees that itâ€™s a no-brainer.â€ ",Real
"Separate mothers and children: How a Trump threat deterred illegal migrants WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump has won the first major battle in his war on illegal immigration, and he did it without building his wall. The victory was announced last week by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which released figures showing a 93 percent drop since December of parents and children caught trying to cross the Mexico border illegally.  In December, 16,000 parents and children were apprehended; in March, a month in which immigration typically increases because of temperate weather, the number was just over 1,100.  It was a remarkable decline - steeper than the 72 percent drop in overall apprehensions - but for eight DHS officials interviewed by Reuters it was not surprising.  Trump has spoken about the need to crack down broadly on all illegal immigrants. But, internally, according to the DHS officials familiar with the departmentâ€™s strategy, his administration has focused on one immigrant group more than others: women with children, the fastest growing demographic of illegal immigrants. This planning has not been previously reported.  In the months since Trumpâ€™s inauguration, DHS has rolled out a range of policies aimed at discouraging women from attempting to cross the border, including tougher initial hurdles for asylum claims and the threat of prosecuting parents if they hire smugglers to get their families across the border. The department has also floated proposals such as separating women and children at the border. DHS Secretary John Kelly told a Senate hearing on April 5 that the sharp drop in illegal immigration, especially among women and children, was due to Trumpâ€™s tough policies. To date, it has been the threat of new policies rather than their implementation that has suppressed family migration. Mothers and children arenâ€™t being separated - and DHS has shelved the plan; parents havenâ€™t been prosecuted, and there is no wall along most of the border. Yet the number of migrants trying to cross â€“ especially women and children â€“ has dropped drastically.  Asked to comment on the policy of targeting women with children, DHS spokesman Jonathan Hoffman referenced the March drop, saying, â€œThose were 15,000 women and children who did not put themselves at risk of death and assault from smugglers to make the trip north.â€   The White House declined to comment and referred Reuters to DHS. For months, Central Americans had heard about Trumpâ€™s get-tough policies. And public service announcements on radio and television presented bleak pictures of what awaited those who traveled north. Some of the ads were funded by the United States, others by United Nations agencies and regional governments. One radio ad in Honduras featured a mother, saying, â€œItâ€™s been a year and I donâ€™t know if she is alive or dead. Iâ€™d do anything to have her here with me. Curse the day I sent her north.â€ The possibility that mothers and children might be separated at the border caused particular alarm, Honduran Deputy Foreign Minister Maria Andrea Matamoros told Reuters â€œThat worries any mother that wants to go to the United States with their kid, and being separated drastically changes their plans,â€ she said.  The policies targeting women and children have their roots in a working group consisting of Capitol Hill staffers and others called together by Trumpâ€™s transition team in the weeks after the Nov. 8 election. The group was asked to develop policies to discourage illegal border crossings and more quickly expel illegal immigrants after they crossed the border, according to two of the DHS officials and a congressional aide.  One goal was to help Trump fulfill a major campaign promise:Â ending so-called â€œcatch and release,â€ the practice of apprehending illegal immigrants but then freeing them to live in the United States while their asylum or deportation cases were resolved.Â   The group quickly identified a major obstacle - the large numbers of women and children continuing to cross the border, said the DHS officials and the aide.  Because a federal court ruling bars prolonged immigration detention of juveniles, the Obama administration generally released mothers and children to live in the United States while awaiting resolution of their asylum or deportation cases. The incoming Trump administration viewed that policy as providing encouragement for women to make the dangerous journey north with their children in tow. But the new administration was bound by the same court ruling. After Kellyâ€™s confirmation as Homeland Security chief in late January,Â several members of the original working group stepped into key roles at DHS. Gene Hamilton, who had worked for then Republican Senator Jeff Sessions, became senior counselor to Kelly, andÂ Dimple Shah, who had been staff director of the House National Security Subcommittee, became deputy general counsel.  Kathy Nuebel-Kovarik, formerly a staffer for Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, became policy chief at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.Â Julie Kirchner left her position as executive director of the conservative Federation for American Immigration Reform to become a top policy adviser at U.S. Customs and Border Protection. None of the groupâ€™s members agreed to be interviewed by Reuters. Several DHS officials said that in their new roles they continued to focus on the issue of women and child migrants. Soon, they had the bare bones of a plan: Since the court ruling on children was an obstacle to prolonged detention, why not separate them from their mothers, sending children into foster care or protective federal custody while their mothers remained in detention centers, the two DHS officials and congressional aide said. The group also advocated two other policies directly affecting mothers and children: raising the bar for asylum and prosecuting parents as human traffickers if they hired human smugglers. The thinking was that â€œif they can just implement tough policies for eight weeks - or even threaten to do that - they would see the numbers of families crossing just plummet,â€ said one DHS official familiar with the planning. On Jan. 25, five days after taking office, Trump issued an executive order ending â€œcatch and release.â€ (A U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official said the agency still releases most women and children in compliance with the federal court order.)  A week later, in a town hall with U.S. Customs and Immigration Services officers, Chief Asylum Officer John Lafferty outlined the possibility of separating women and children in a semi-public setting for the first time, according to notes of the meeting seen by Reuters. For more than a month after that meeting, the proposal did not leak, but after Reuters broke news of it in early March, Kelly confirmed that it was under consideration. Democratic members of Congress blasted the proposal, and within days it had made headlines across Mexico and Central America.  That month, the number of children traveling with guardians apprehended at the border fell to one-third of what it had been in February.  When Kelly and his advisers saw the numbers dropping, they announced they were shelving the idea of separating women and children â€“ at least for now. Asked whether it may be revived, DHS spokeswoman Jenny Burke said, â€œFamilies caught crossing the border illegally, generally will not be separated unless the situation at the time requires it.â€ ",Real
" GOP Governor Demands A â€˜Thank Youâ€™ From Rep. John Lewis Because Republicans Freed The Slaves Just when you thought Republicans couldn t be bigger pricks toward Rep. John Lewis, one governor is demanding that Lewis thank today s GOP for ending slavery in 1865.Rep. John Lewis is a civil rights hero who risked his life fighting for voting rights with Martin Luther King during the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s. He was at the Lincoln Memorial as King delivered his  I Have A Dream  speech, So he knows full well what President Abraham Lincoln and the early Republican Party did to free the slaves and advance civil rights.But that Republican Party has changed significantly over the last 150 years, and is now controlled by white supremacists and racists and spends most of its time trying to suppress voting rights and deny civil rights to people of color more than it does defending the legacy Lincoln built.Maine s Tea Party Governor Paul LePage, however, still thinks Republicans like himself deserve praise for something the party did over a century and a half ago.During an interview with WVOM, LePage criticized Lewis for calling Trump illegitimate and demanded that Lewis thank white Republicans for freeing the slave. John Lewis ought to look at history,  LePage said.  It was Abraham Lincoln who freed the slaves, it was Rutherford B. Hayes and Ulysses S. Grant who fought against Jim Crow laws. A simple thank you would suffice. Except that Hayes sold-out the fight for civil rights in exchange for the presidency. As the Bangor Daily News pointed out, Hayes struck  an informal deal after a contested election that gave him the White House in exchange for promising to pull Northern troops out of the South. Pulling out those troops marked the premature end of Reconstruction and the beginning of Jim Crow laws in the South that would remain intact for a century until King and Lewis spearheaded a renewed fight for equality.It should be pointed out that Democrats were the ones who passed the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act into law while Republicans began pandering to racist southerners and have turned their backs on their liberal past ever since.But now Republicans like LePage think that they are owed praise for ending slavery even though Republican today would like to bring slavery back.According to Alternet,Not content to merely support an insurrection against the duly elected government of the United States, 80 percent of the Republicans surveyed by CNN also expressed admiration for the leaders of the South a cabal whose allegiance to white supremacy was most tellingly summed up by the Vice President of the Confederacy s sentiment that its,  foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man, that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition. This, our new government, is the first, in the history of the world, based on this great physical, philosophical and moral truth. In fact, 20 percent of Donald Trump supporters think freeing the slaves was a bad idea. Seriously.So the idea that John Lewis owes thanks to Republicans like LePage is absolutely laughable, especially since LePage has called for  people of color  to be shot.If the only civil rights accomplishment Republicans can point to is the freeing of the slaves 150 years ago, their r sum  is in severe need of an update. Of course, that will never happen because Republicans are controlled by racists. Abraham Lincoln is surely rolling in his grave.Featured image via Flickr",Fake
"McConnell to support Trump-Democratic deal on debt ceiling, Harvey WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Wednesday he supports fellow Republican President Donald Trumpâ€™s deal with Democratic congressional leaders to extend the U.S. debt ceiling and fund the government into December in legislation that would provide relief for victims of Hurricane Harvey. â€œThatâ€™s what I will be offering, based on the presidentâ€™s decision, to the (House of Representatives) bill.

"Trump acknowledges he is under investigation in Russia probe WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump acknowledged on Friday he is under investigation in a probe of alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential race and possible collusion by his campaign - and seemed to assail the Justice Department official overseeing the inquiry. Robert Mueller, the special counsel named by the department to investigate the Russia matter, is now examining whether Trump or others sought to obstruct the probe, a person familiar with the inquiry said on Thursday. â€œI am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director! Witch Hunt,â€ Trump wrote on Twitter, referring to his May 9 dismissal of James Comey. Trump did not identify â€œthe manâ€ but appeared to be questioning the integrity of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the Justice Departmentâ€™s No. 2 official who appointed Mueller on May 17, supervises the probe and wrote a memo to Trump critical of Comey that preceded Comeyâ€™s firing. Hours later, a source close to Trumpâ€™s outside legal team said Trump did not intend his tweet to be confirmation of the investigation but rather was reacting to a Washington Post story on Wednesday about the probe. The source spoke on condition of anonymity.  Rosenstein has said privately he may need to recuse himself from matters relating to the Russia probe because he could become a witness in the investigation, ABC News reported on Friday. ABC said Rosenstein told Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand she would have authority over the probe if he were to step aside. The Democratic National Committee called on Rosenstein to recuse himself from the Russia matter, but it said authority over the investigation should be given to Mueller and not another Trump appointee. While the Republican Trump administration initially said Rosensteinâ€™s letter was the reason the president fired Comey on May 9, Trump later said he did so because of the â€œRussia thing.â€ Comey told a Senate panel last week he believed Trump fired him to undermine the Federal Bureau of Investigationâ€™s Russia probe. Comey testified that Trump directed him in February to drop an FBI investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn relating to the Russia matter. Comey testified it would be up to Mueller to decide whether Trumpâ€™s action amounted to obstruction of justice, an act that could be cited in any effort in the Republican-led Congress to impeach him and remove him from office. The Russia issue has cast a shadow over Trumpâ€™s five months in office. In another indication of the seriousness of the probe, Michael Cohen, a personal attorney to Trump, said he has retained attorney Stephen Ryan, a former assistant U.S. attorney, to represent him in the ongoing probes. Cohen has received a subpoena from one of the congressional committees looking into the Russia issue. Rosenstein has authority over the inquiry because Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself on March 2 after revelations of previously undisclosed meetings with Russiaâ€™s ambassador to Washington while he was a Trump campaign adviser. Brand was confirmed as the No. 3 Justice Department official on a 52-46 vote in the Senate on May 18, with Democrats lining up against her. From 2011 until her confirmation, she was a lawyer for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce business lobbying groupâ€™s legal arm, which played a major role in marshaling legal opposition to environmental and labor regulations championed by Democratic former President Barack Obama. Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Senate Intelligence Committee member, said she was â€œincreasingly concernedâ€ Trump would try to fire not only Mueller, but also Rosenstein. â€œThe message the president is sending through his tweets is that he believes the rule of law doesnâ€™t apply to him and that anyone who thinks otherwise will be fired,â€ Feinstein said. A Trump confidant said this week the president had considered firing Mueller. Rosenstein, who would be responsible for actually dismissing Mueller, told U.S. lawmakers he would fire him only with good cause. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in January that Russia interfered in the presidential race to try to help Trump win, in part by hacking and releasing emails damaging to his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. Moscow has denied any interference. The White House denies any collusion. Trump kept up his criticism of the investigations, writing on Twitter, â€œAfter 7 months of investigations & committee hearings about my â€˜collusion with the Russians,â€™ nobody has been able to show any proof. Sad!â€ ",Real

"Clinton, in book, says Trump's debate stalking made her skin crawl WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton says in her new book that Donald Trump made her skin crawl by stalking her around the stage in a campaign debate and she wonders if she should have told him to â€œback up, you creep.â€ In audio excerpts of the book â€œWhat Happenedâ€ aired on Wednesday on MSNBC, Clinton described her 2016 campaign as â€œjoyful, humbling, infuriating and just plain bafflingâ€ and acknowledged she failed her millions of supporters by losing to Trump in the November election. In the excerpts, Clinton described the Oct. 9 debate in St. Louis in which Trump followed her closely about the stage, lurking behind her as she fielded questions from a live television audience. The debate came two days after an audiotape emerged in which Trump was heard bragging about groping women. â€œThis is not OK, I thought,â€ Clinton says. â€œIt was the second presidential debate and Donald Trump was looming behind me. â€œWe were on a small stage and no matter where I walked, he followed me closely, staring at me, making faces. It was incredibly uncomfortable. He was literally breathing down my neck. My skin crawled,â€ Clinton said. â€œIt was one of those moments where you wish you could hit pause and ask everyone watching: â€˜Well, what would you do?â€™ Do you stay calm, keep smiling and carry on as if he werenâ€™t repeatedly invading your space? Or do you turn, look him in the eye and say loudly and clearly: â€˜Back up, you creep. Get away from me. I know you love to intimidate women but you canâ€™t intimidate me.â€™â€ Clinton says she chose the first option. â€œI kept my cool, aided by a lifetime of dealing with difficult men trying to throw me off,â€ she says. But Clinton questions whether she should have chosen the second option. â€œIt certainly would have been better TV,â€ she says. â€œMaybe I have over-learned the lesson of staying calm, biting my tongue, digging my fingernails into a clenched fist, smiling all the while, determined to present a composed face to the world.â€ Clinton says writing the book, due to be released in the coming weeks, â€œwasnâ€™t easy.â€ â€œEvery day that I was a candidate for president, I knew that millions of people were counting on me and I couldnâ€™t bear the idea of letting them down.

"Ex-Trump aide Flynn's family creates fund for 'enormous' legal fees (Reuters) - Relatives of former national security adviser Michael Flynn have set up a fund to help pay for his legal defense against federal and congressional investigations into potential collusion between Donald Trumpâ€™s presidential campaign and Russia.

Flynn, a central figure in a federal probe led by special counsel Robert Mueller, as well as a focal point of congressional investigations, broke a months-long silence to thank his siblings for their support on Twitter. â€œLori and I are very grateful to my brother Joe and sister Barbara for creating a fund to help pay my legal defense costs,â€ Flynn said in a tweet, referring to his wife Lori. Flynn was fired by Trump as national security adviser after less than a month on the job. The firing came 18 days after a senior Justice Department official warned that Flynn could be blackmailed because Moscow knew he made misleading statements about his contacts with Russian officials. Flynn in August reported income of at least $1.8 million,  according to an amended financial disclosure form, which included paid speaking engagements to Russian entities, including the Kremlin-funded RT TV and Volga-Dnepr Airlines and payments for lobbying for the Turkish government.

" WATCH: Trump Insults Poland By Downplaying The Horrors They Experienced During World War II Six million Poles lost their lives during World War II. But to Donald Trump, that s just  tough. Perhaps no nation suffered as much devastation as Poland did during the war. The nation was invaded and terrorized by the Nazis and then invaded and terrorized by the Soviet Union. Poland was caught in the middle as two brutal military powers clashed.Poland experienced war first-hand, as well as poverty, homelessness, starvation, disease, and the Holocaust. In fact, Poland lost the highest percentage of citizens during the war and its population did not recover until the 1970s.On top of that, Poland went from suffering under Nazi rule to suffering under Soviet rule. The Soviets sent Poles to gulags throughout the Soviet Union. Communism would dominate Poland until the free elections of 1989, and after that, communism in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union itself collapsed.The utter devastation suffered by Poland demands proper recognition. And Trump proved that he is incapable of expressing true sadness about such a human tragedy.During his speech to the people of Poland, Trump spoke of Poland s tragic history as if it was simply an everyday hardship like having one s car stolen or breaking a leg and having no health insurance. In 1939 you were invaded yet again, by Nazi Germany from the west, and the Soviet Union from the east. That s trouble. That s tough. Here s the video via VidMe. Tough  is not the appropriate word to describe what the Polish people went through during World War II.Hitler literally planned to wipe out the entire Polish people from existence and tried to do exactly that. The Soviets took away their nationality and treated them like non-citizens as well as taking away their lands and killing those who protested. And all Trump can say about it is that it was  tough. So Trump waltzed into Warsaw, a city that was nearly bombed out of existence, and insulted the Polish people to their faces, once again embarrassing our country. And the Polish crowds were forced to cheer for him. Seriously.Trump gets more pathetic every day.Featured image via screenshot",Fake
" EVERY State In America Just Turned On Trump, This Is A Major â€˜F*ck Youâ€™ To POTUS (DETAILS) From day one of Donald Trump s failure of a presidency, it was perfectly clear that the former reality television star thought he was a king and expected America to roll over and do whatever the hell he wanted. Unfortunately for the unworthy POTUS, his presidency is panning out a lot differently than he imagined, and he s just been sent another great big  f*ck you  by the United States.Trump s voter fraud conspiracy has just been dealt a major blow and suffered a humiliating defeat, as every single state in America is refusing to give up the voter data that Trump is demanding. According to The Washington Post: In a rare display of bipartisanship, officials in nearly every state have said they will partially or fully refuse to comply with President Trump s voting commission, which has encountered criticism and opposition after issuing a sweeping request for voter data nationwide. Even as some of the resistance centers on Trump and members of his commission, the broader responses from the states indicate a strong and widespread belief that local officials should be managing elections and that the White House s request for volumes of information went too far. That s right   America as a whole united and agreed that what Trump wanted was unconstitutional or illegal, and made moves to protect Americans  private data. This is not only extremely embarrassing for Trump, but it also reveals that his administration is increasingly lazy and sloppy, having not even bothered to look and see if their request for the voter data was legal by state law!Unlike Trump and his incompetent team, the majority of America is not so reckless and willing to bow down to a complete idiot.

" This One Sentence BEAUTIFULLY Nails Down Exactly What Kind Of â€˜Leaderâ€™ Trump Will Be The double-talk that spews forth from King Cheeto s mouth is astonishing, if for no other reason than so many people believe all of it. He s a liar, he s a hypocrite, he s an autocrat, he s a narcissist. And he promises to continue talking out of both sides of his mouth the same as he did on the campaign trail.And his audiences will continue to eat up every syllable. Why on earth do they do that? Matt Bai, a political columnist at Yahoo! News, boils it down to this one sentence: Trump is a pure opportunist, a pitch-perfect crooner of whatever note resonates.  [emphasis mine]BOOM! There it is, right there. Trump knows exactly what will make people respond favorably to him and he says it. In doing so, he renders anything he said before irrelevant, no matter how contradictory. Look at all his cabinet picks that followed his promise of  draining the swamp  of Washington insiders, elites and cronies. His cabinet is Wall Street bankers. It s establishment politicians. It s members of the very same military leadership he called stupid during his campaign.Trump embodies a type of leader known as the  charismatic leader,  and that s not necessarily a good thing. True, not all charismatic leaders are bad, but they aren t all good either. In Trump s case, this is a very bad thing. In Management Today, columnist Adam Gale says the world that Trump comes from is one where  force of personality is more important than collaboration or cold reasoning. That s all that matters, and why we re suddenly living in a post-fact world. Facts, truths, and reason don t matter if Trump can convince people they don t matter. And he himself admitted to playing his audiences like the violins they re not in The Art of the Deal: I play to people s fantasies. People may not always think big themselves, but they can still get very excited by those who do. That s why a little hyperbole never hurts.  [emphasis mine]Think he won t do that as President? Think again   he s already done it. His loyal subjects still bleat about how amazing he is to have struck a deal with Carrier to keep jobs here in the U.S. They completely ignore the facts that Carrier is still sending jobs to Mexico and is planning to raise prices. They don t seem to care that they re going to automate their Indiana plant, which will destroy some of those jobs Trump supposedly saved so they can keep their costs down. Their parent company s CEO, Greg Hayes, said that outright: We re going to automate to drive the cost down so that we can continue to be competitive. Is it as cheap as moving to Mexico with lower cost labor? No. But we will make that plant competitive just because we ll make the capital investments there. But what that ultimately means is there will be fewer jobs. In the case of the Carrier deal, Trumpkins  specific fantasy is the idea that Trump can coerce, cajole, and even strongarm companies, one by one, into not only keep jobs here, but also into at least maintaining their current workforce, or adding more jobs. The fantasy is that Trump is going to be able to erase every individual s personal economic distress.That s impossible, but that s what they see through their rose-colored glasses. There are other fantasies, too, like this: My whole life I ve been greedy, greedy, greedy. I ve grabbed all the money I could get. I m so greedy. But now I d like to be greedy for the United States. Washington Post columnist and The Nation publisher Katrina vanden Heuvel hit the nail of that Trumpkin fantasy on the head with this: It was a compelling story: the rapacious mogul turned Robin Hood, setting out to reform the rigged system that made him rich in the name of the common good. She went on to describe how that s an illusion that Trump has created for his faithful subjects, but which his actual policy positions during his campaign should have shattered.This is how Trump s followers can keep right on crowing about Trump s awesomeness and how he s the president we need to be great again. One could even say that they re brainwashed in a very real way (they also seem to be too stupid to see how stupid they are, but that s a different subject).Oh sure, there are a few who are angry. There are a few who have woken up. Former Congressman Joe Walsh, of Illinois, is one such person (and agreeing with that man on anything at all makes us feel like we re in a bizarre alternate reality where night is day, hell is cold, and dragons really do exist, but, well, there it is).Sarah Palin called out his deal with Carrier as crony capitalism.But so many others? They re on social media being as trashy as ever toward the press, toward Democrats, toward anyone who doesn t march exactly to Trump s drumbeat. They re calling any news that doesn t reinforce the golden crown they see on Cheetolini s head  fake news,  and completely ignoring how many campaign promises Trump has already broken. They trust him implicitly because he knows exactly how to sing their tune in perfect time and pitch. Whether he means it is irrelevant.And he ll keep right on playing them. Bai said he ll do it until someone can prove to him that there s a real cost. Bai is right.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images",Fake
" Chaffetz Says Screw Congress, Might Leave Before His Term Is Up (DETAILS) House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), doesn t think he wants to be a Congressman anymore. He already dropped jaws when he announced that he would not be running for Congress again, but now he says he might not even finish out his term and may just run for the hills instead.Speaking to KSL News Radio s Doug Wright on Thursday, Chaffetz said he hasn t decided what he is going to do yet, but he might choose not to finish out his term. He made it clear that he still hasn t made up his mind about what he will do and is taking into consideration what the state of Utah would have to do to replace him if he walks away from his seat. I will continue to weigh the options, but I might depart early,  Chaffetz told the radio host.On Wednesday, Chaffetz made the announcement that he would not be running for either the House or Senate in 2018. However, at no point has he tried to rule out the possibility of a future run for another office, such as governor of Utah, for example.At this point, his office has not returned requests for comment or released an official statement. Chaffetz is currently serving his fifth term. If he chooses to remain in Congress, he would be able to serve as House Oversight Committee Chairman until 2020 according to the House GOP s present rules, which limit committee chairs to three terms.Chaffetz said he is considering abandoning his career in Congress because he wants to spend more time with his family and is ready to return to the private sector. If he does decide to leave, the race to fill his seat as chairman of the Oversight Committee will commence. So far, no one on the powerful committee has been willing to publicly confirm whether they would be interested in taking his place as chairman.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",Fake

" POLL: Trump Is The Least Popular President Of All Time â€” And Itâ€™s Getting Worse Donald Trump may think he s the best, but it looks like most Americans disagree. In reality, he s the worst. Numerous polls show that Trump is the least popular president ever. And the more time passes, the lower his approval rating sinks.The most recent Gallup Poll shows Trump s approval rating at a mere 37 percent, with 58 percent of Americans disapproving of the job he s doing as president. That s down from a brief stint at 40 percent approval earlier this month. His lowest approval ratings came in March when only 35 percent thought he was doing a decent job in the White House, but he is darn close to that now.In fact, other polls show that he has already reached the magic number of 35 percent approval, his all-time low. The American Research Group has Trump s approval rating at 35 percent, which has dropped from 37 percent approval in June and 39 percent in both May and April. Rasmussen Reports, Trump s favorite poll, also showed that Trump s approval rating is currently tied with his all-time low.According to Newsweek, Trump is closing in on his record low approval ratings in just about every poll out there. Five Thirty Eight has Trump s approval rating at 38.4 percent, just 0.4 points above his all-time low.But these aren t just record lows for Trump, they are record lows for any U.S. president ever. That s right, Trump is officially the least popular president in the history of the United States and he s only been in office for six f*cking months.It s official: @realDonaldTrump is the least popular new president in history.That could mean big trouble for his presidency.

" Yet Another Asshole Just Rammed A Bunch Of Protesters With His Car (VIDEO) Yet another horrible human being decided to ram his car through a crowd of protesters in California on Thursday.Daniel Wenzyk, who was convicted of committing lewd acts against a child under the age of 14 in 2006, apparently got impatient as protesters rallied for immigrants  rights and did what we can normally expect from horrible human beings: he tried to run a bunch of people down with his car. I think he was trying to get through the crowd,  Lt.

" CNN Host Expertly SHREDS Trump And Conservative Commentator For Trashing John Lewis (VIDEO) President-elect Donald Trump made another MAJOR mistake when he had the audacity to trash civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis (D-GA) just two days before Martin Luther King Day.It all started because Lewis said what many Americans were thinking when he stated, I don t believe Donald Trump is a legitimate president , and Trump couldn t hold back his little orange fingers and gigantic temper tantrum. He tweeted: Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results. All talk, talk, talk   no action or results. Sad! The clueless former reality television star got absolutely gutted on Twitter for this, and rightfully so. Unfortunately, his moronic supporters are defending him   one of them being CNN conservative political commentator and radio host Ben Ferguson, who bashed Lewis  comments and called them  unprecedented.  Ferguson said: I can t imagine the fallout, the backfire that you would have if a Republican ever implied that about Barack Obama or Bill Clinton or JFK or anyone else for that matter. Anyone in their right mind not only knows that Lewis is right, but that Trump is a moron for criticizing the civil rights hero. CNN host Poppy Harlow was having none of it, and she immediately tore into Ferguson and the Republican party for complaining about the same things they did to President Barack Obama for the past 8 years. She said: Ben, Ben, Ben, that s exactly what many Republicans did, including the president-elect for years questioning the legitimacy of the first black president. Bringing up the fact that Trump was a major voice behind  birther  conspiracy theories involving Obama, Harlow totally shut Ferguson down by reminding him,  The president-elect did that to the sitting president for years.

" Trumpâ€™s Rhetoric Just Resulted In A Trillion Dollar Economic Loss Worldwide If Donald Trump wants to take credit for something he actually did to the economy, now would be the time.Earlier this week, Trump threatened war against North Korea, resulting in a war of words with Kim Jong-Un and escalated threats that culminated in a Friday morning tweet from Trump.Military solutions are now fully in place,locked and loaded,should North Korea act unwisely. Hopefully Kim Jong Un will find another path!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 11, 2017The rhetorical march towards what could end up being a real nuclear war wrecked havoc on global markets, including Wall Street, as stocks plunged. In all, the economic loss added up to $1 trillion, the effects of which will likely hit households in America and around the world hard.According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch,With the tense mood pushing European shares down for a third day and Wall Street set to fall again, global stocks were on course for their worst week since Donald Trump won November s U.S. presidential election. We do just not know what happens next with the North Korea situation,  said BNY Mellon FX strategist Neil Mellor. For quite some time the market hasn t really reacted to things on the Korean Peninsula because we know from the past it is largely North Korean saber-rattling, and it may yet be. But with the rhetoric having gone to a different level, the market just can t afford to take that risk. Many world stock markets have hit record or multi-year highs in recent weeks, leaving them vulnerable to a sell-off, and the tensions over North Korea have proved the trigger.Indeed, Asia Pacific shares just suffered their biggest one-day loss since December. South Korea s KOSPI dropped by nearly a full two percent.In addition,  Australian shares were down 1.3 percent, set for a weekly loss of 0.6 percent and Chinese and Hong Kong bluechips lost 1.6 percent and 1.9 percent respectively. What has changed this time is that the scary threats and war of words between the U.S. and North Korea have intensified to the point that markets can t ignore it,  said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP Capital in Sydney, reports the Post-Dispatch.The Dow Jones has also been falling since Tuesday, the same day Trump threatened North Korea with  fire and fury.  As of Friday, the Dow has shed 300 points.Trump often brags about the stock market even though the record growth began under President Obama. Donald Trump has not enacted a single economic policy since taking office. The stock market had continued setting records thanks to President Obama s handling of the economy and steady leadership. Trump was merely taking credit for Obama s achievement.But now the stock market is falling in America and around the world because of Trump s war rhetoric, which means this trillion dollar loss is all his fault. There is no blaming President Obama for this economic slide. Trump owns this. And more rhetoric or an attack on North Korea will just make things worse.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",Fake
" Republicans Kill Trumpâ€™s Dream To Repeal Obamacare, Ready To Work With Democrats (DETAILS) Despite the humiliating failure Donald Trump and the Republican Party brought upon themselves by trying to repeal and replace Obamacare, Trump continues to keep pressuring GOP lawmakers to do his pathetic bidding and pass some form of Trumpcare. Even as it s clear to everyone else that lawmakers must move on and focus on other things, Trump is threatening to withhold ACA payments from insurance companies. However, Trump has just been handed a devastating blow as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell makes moves toward a bipartisan approach to health care.This is seriously the last thing Trump wants, but it s happening and the GOP doesn t care how Trump feels about it. According to CBS News: A week after an attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act failed, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says he d consider a bipartisan effort to continue payments to insurers to avert a costly rattling of health insurance markets.McConnell told reporters Saturday there is  still a chance  the Senate could revive the measure to repeal and replace  Obamacare,  but he acknowledged the window for that is rapidly closing. Everyone knows that the Obamacare repeal is hopeless. Americans are strongly against it, and nothing the Republican Party has put forward over the last few months has even been close to an alternative. Republicans are slowly becoming aware that a bipartisan bill might be their only chance to have some sort of impact on health care   and if Congress approves a bipartisan bill with enough support to override a presidential veto, Trump will be forced to sign the bill whether he likes it or not.Trump s presidency looks more and more like a failure every single day. Even the members of his own party are ignoring him and moving away from his agenda. Trump isn t a president, he is a joke.Featured image is a screenshot",Fake
" CNN CALLS IT: A Democrat Will Represent Alabama In The Senate For The First Time In 25 Years Alabama is a notoriously deep red state. It s a place where Democrats always think that we have zero chances of winning   especially in statewide federal elections. However, that is just what happened on Tuesday night in the Special Election to replace Senator Jeff Sessions. Doug Jones, the Democratic Senate candidate who is known in the state for prosecuting the Ku Klux Klan members who bombed a church during the Civil Rights Movement and killed four little African American girls, will be the next Senator from Alabama. CNN has just called the race, as there seems no more GOP-leaning counties out there.To contrast, Roy Moore had been twice removed from the Alabama Supreme Court as Chief Justice for violating the law, and was also credibly accused of being a sexual predator toward teen girls. Despite all of that, though, the race was a nail biter, because Moore has a long history and a deep base in Alabama. Of course, decent people   including Republicans   were horrified at the idea of a man like Roy Moore going to the Senate. Despite the allegations of sexual predation, Moore also had said many incendiary things, such as putting forth the idea that Muslims shouldn t be allowed in Congress, that homosexuality should be illegal, and that America was great when slavery was legal. And that s just for starters, too.Thank you Alabama, for letting sanity prevail in this race. Oh, and a message to Democrats   this is proof we can compete everywhere.

" Trump Suffers HUMILIATING Reality Check After Bragging About The Number Of Bills He Has Signed Donald Trump stroked his own ego again and got humiliated for it.During a very creepy Cabinet meeting where each member took their turn praising Trump on national television, Trump bragged about the number of bills he has signed, claiming to have signed more legislation than any other president in history except Franklin Roosevelt. I will say that never has there been a president   with few exceptions, in the case of FDR he had a major Depression to handle   who s passed more legislation, who s done more things than what we ve done,  Trump boasted.Technically, it s sort of true. Actually, Roosevelt and Truman signed more. But the kind of legislation Trump has signed thus far is insignificant. For instance, most of the bills include creating memorials, designating buildings, appointing members to the Smithsonian board, encouraging Americans to display the flag on a certain day, and a bunch of other pithy bills that really are pathetic when you consider all the major pieces of legislation other presidents signed after they took office.But that didn t stop Trump from blowing his own horn again on Twitter Friday morning.I ve helped pass and signed 38 Legislative Bills, mostly with no Democratic support, and gotten rid of massive amounts of regulations.

"'Nonsense': Powerful Republican denounces White House information shut-out WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An already contentious move by Republican President Donald Trump to block opposition Democratic lawmakers from getting information about his administration received its most scathing criticism yet on Friday - from one of the most powerful Republican members of the U.S. Senate. Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa, in a more than 2,100-word letter to the White House, asked Trump to rescind unprecedented guidance that told executive agencies they do not have to honor requests for information from lawmakers in the minority party, currently the Democrats. This week in hearings all over Capitol Hill members of both parties have criticized the information block. Democrats have posited that the Trump administration is trying to hide mistakes, problems or wrongdoing from them. Grassley, who has served in the Senate since 1981, called the guidance â€œnonsenseâ€ and described it as â€œa bureaucratic effort by the Office of Legal Counsel to insulate the executive branch from scrutiny by the elected representatives of the American people.â€  The Judiciary Committee has jurisdiction over the Justice Department and its Office of Legal Counsel, which published the guidance last month. Grassley said it goes against the U.S. Constitution by misrepresenting how Congress functions and trying to tell the legislative branch how to do its job. It also impedes Democratic lawmakersâ€™ ability to check up on the president, a responsibility also laid out in the constitution, Grassley wrote in a letter replete with footnotes and case citations. â€œI know from experience that a partisan response to oversight only discourages bipartisanship, decreases transparency, and diminishes the crucial role of the American peopleâ€™s elected representatives,â€ he wrote.Â â€œOversight brings transparency, and transparency brings accountability.â€Â  The Justice Department declined to comment on Grassleyâ€™s letter or the guidance. The White House did not return a request for comment. The Office of Legal Counsel has not explained the impetus for publishing the opinion. The guidance did not single out Democrats by name. Instead, it addressed information requests to executive agencies from the highest-ranking lawmaker from the minority party sitting on congressional committees, called ranking members. The Republicans hold the majority in both the Senate and U.S. House of Representatives and therefore chair all the committees, with Democrats as ranking members.  The opinion said that agencies only have to respond to  information requests from committee chairs. Ranking member requests â€œdo not trigger any obligation to accommodate congressional needs and are not legally enforceable through a subpoena or contempt proceedings,â€ it said. ",Real

"U.S. ends program for Central American minors fleeing violence NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Homeland Security terminated a program on Wednesday that allowed minors fleeing violence in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras to settle in the United States, ending travel hopes for more than 2,700 children awaiting approval. In a notice published in the Federal Register that goes into effect Aug. 16, the government said it was ending the practice of granting parole under the Central American Minors (CAM) Program, which was offered to children even if they had been denied refugee status. The program started at the end of 2014 under the administration of former President Barack Obama as a response to tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors and families from Central America who arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border seeking entry into the United States.   An executive order on border security signed by U.S. President Donald Trump days after he took office in January triggered a review of the program, putting on hold applications of more than 2,700 children who had been conditionally approved for entry into the United States. Now those applications will be canceled. The bulk of the children approved for the program were from El Salvador. Immigration advocacy group Kids in Need of Defense (KIND) said that cancelling the program would lead to more children to try to find other means to enter the United States.  â€œThese children have been repeatedly told by the U.S. government, including the Trump Administration, not to migrate to the United States due to safety concerns,â€ the organization said in a statement. â€œNow this Administration is cutting off the only authorized channel and leaving children no choice but to make the perilous journey to the United States.â€ The program allowed children under 21 years old with parents lawfully living in the United States to apply for a refugee resettlement interview before making the journey to the United States.  As of August 4, more than 1,500 children and eligible family members had arrived in the United States as refugees under the CAM program, according to the State Department.  Children who did not qualify for refugee status and had no other means of reuniting with their parents in the United States  could also apply for entry under the program. They would be approved for parole for two years, allowing them to travel and stay in the United States and apply for work permits.   Since its inception, more than 1,400 children were granted parole and allowed to travel to the United States. They included  1,110 from El Salvador, 324 from Honduras and 31 from Guatemala, according to a spokesman from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).  Now, they will have to re-apply for parole once their two-year term expires but will only be able to have it renewed if they can demonstrate â€œan urgent humanitarian or a significant public benefit reasonâ€ for them to stay, the federal register said. Parole decisions would be determined on a case-by-case basis. More than 13,000 people have applied for the program since it began, the State Department said. Around 1 percent of applicants were denied both for refugee status and parole, according to the USCIS spokesman. The refugee portion of the program will not be affected by Wednesdayâ€™s termination and children stranded abroad can still apply as refugees.  ",Real
" WATCH: Jake Tapper BURIES Kellanne Conway For Lies And Hypocrisy About Terrorism Coverage Jake Tapper laid into Kellyanne Conway on Tuesday over Donald Trump s claim that the media is covering up terrorist attacks.On Monday, Trump literally accused the media of ignoring terrorist attacks to keep the American people in the dark and to keep them in opposition to his Muslim ban. It s gotten to a point where it s not even being reported,  Trump told U.S. Central Command.  And in many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn t want to report it. They have their reasons and you understand that. Except that the media has covered lots of terrorist attacks over the years, most of them extensively and journalists have risked their lives to report on some of them.Trump released a list of supposed undercovered terrorist attacks and the list somehow included Paris, Nice, and San Bernardino among other significant attacks even though the media exhaustively covered them.So CNN let Conway appear again on the network to answer for Trump s lies, and they apparently did that so she could get her ass handed to her by Jake Tapper.During the interview, Tapper demanded to know why Trump won t stop lying and refused to take Conway s bullshit when she attempted to spin. After he said that, the White House released a list of the attacks that he was supposedly referring to as, in his words, not even being reported, I want to put some footage of CNN reporters covering attacks that were on that list,  Tapper said.  Saying that we don t cover terrorism, that s just false. And, indeed, he did put the footage up and forced Conway to concede that not only did CNN cover many of the attacks on the list, they did a good job doing it.But Conway still tried to claim that Trump was somehow making a point by including those attacks and she soon began whining about how the media has covered Trump from the campaign trail to the White House.Apparently, the Wicked Witch of the West expected all the media coverage to be one big cheerleading squad for the Trump administration.That didn t fly with Tapper. That s a lovely spin, but that s not what he was saying Kellyanne,  Tapper said, reminding her that Trump literally accused the media of not reporting on these attacks.And then Tapper went for the jugular and demanded to know why Trump has remained silent about a terrorist attack in Quebec, Canada that was committed against a mosque by a white right-wing Trump fan. President Trump has not said or tweeted one public word about this,  Tapper said.  You want to talk about ignoring terrorism, why hasn t the president offered his sympathy to our neighbors in the north? Mic. Dropped.Conway tried to claim that Trump is opposed to any loss of life, but the fact is that while he constantly whines about petty things on Twitter on a daily basis, he couldn t even be bothered to say anything about the attack in Quebec. In fact, all of the terrorist attacks Trump listed were committed by Muslim extremists, conveniently ignoring the higher number of terrorist attacks committed by white right-wingers in this country.Tapper even noted that Trump found time to tweet about the attack at the Louvre in Paris in which no lives were lost but completely ignored the Quebec attack that killed six innocent people.Here s the video via YouTube.Seriously, CNN and every other media outlets should permanently ban Kellyanne Conway from appearing on their programming. Even when confronted with the truth she continues to lie for Donald Trump and then spins by whining about media coverage. It s the only play she has in her playbook and it is embarrassing and pathetic.Featured Image: Screenshot",Fake
" Scumbag Gets ONLY 10 Days In Jail For Trying To Murder A Woman When She Refused To Have Sex With Him These kinds of slaps on the wrist should get judges fired. Period.Wesley Dylan Marshall is probably only going to serve 75 percent of a ridiculous 10 day jail sentence for what he did to a 19-year-old woman this past July.During a stay at the Church Hill Motel with the woman and another man, Marshall became angry and assaulted the woman by literally throwing her off the side of a balcony two stories high because she consented to having sex with the other man and not him in celebration of her birthday.According to the Kingsport Times-News,Aside from the jail time and anger management classes, Marshall was sentenced to 11 months and 29 days of probation, ordered to serve 96 hours of community service, issued fines and fees totaling $1,237 and ordered to have no contact with the victim.It all adds up to yet another light sentence for a white guy who committed violence against a woman, proving once again that the judicial system and the law does not go far enough to protect women from assholes like Marshall.Judges across the country have disgraced themselves by sentencing rapists and abusers to light sentences.In June, Judge Aaron Persky sentenced rapist Brock Turner to only six months in jail, igniting a firestorm of criticism.In August, Colorado Judge Patrick Butler gave a rapist ZERO prison time.A Massachusetts judge did the same thing during the same month and even gave the perpetrator permission to serve his probation in another state so he can attend college.And a Montana judge is facing impeachment for sentencing a man to just 60 days in jail for raping his own daughter.This latest sentencing in Tennessee is just adding to the pattern.Clearly, there are far too many judges in this country who have a frat boy attitude about the way white guys treat women and it s only getting worse.Featured Image: Raw Story",Fake
"U.S. Senate still on track to release tax bill Thursday: aide WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate is still on track to release on Thursday its version of a bill to overhaul the nationâ€™s tax code, a congressional source told Reuters. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch has not announced a specific day for the billâ€™s release and said only that it would be toward the end of the week.   Axios reported on Wednesday that the bill would be delayed past Thursday, but the source told Reuters it was on track to be released that day. Friday is a U.S. holiday and the Senate will not be in session. The House of Representatives released its version of the tax  legislation backed by Republican President Donald Trump last week and is aiming to vote on its bill next week, a senior Republican said. Passing the tax overhaul has been a priority for Trump, who says it will stimulate economic growth and create jobs. But Republicans have yet to score a major legislative accomplishment since the president took office in January, even though the party controls also both chambers of Congress. ",Real
" WATCH: Chuck Todd BLASTS Trumpâ€™s Goldman Sachs Cabinet Picks As Hypocritical Bullsh*t Kellyanne Conway was absolutely grilled by Chuck Todd on Friday because Donald Trump has been picking Goldman Sachs executives for his cabinet.Donald Trump spent a good part of his campaign trashing Hillary Clinton for having mere connections to Goldman Sachs. Now he has picked three Goldman Sachs alums, including Steve Bannon as his chief policy strategist, Steven Mnuchin as Treasury Secretary, and Gary Cohn as the head of the National Economic Council.Chuck Todd began by playing video of Trump demonizing Ted Cruz and Hillary Clinton for taking donations from Goldman Sachs. They have total control over him just like they have total control over Hillary Clinton,  Trump said, claiming that he doesn t need money from Goldman Sachs and that doesn t want it, therefore, Goldman Sachs has  no control  over him. He railed against Goldman Sachs,  Todd told Conway.  Three Goldman Sachs alums. Fairly prominent positions. How is that not hypocritical? Of course, Conway tried to spin in defense of Trump. He railed against their political influence,  Conway said, which doesn t really make sense since Trump literally just gave three Goldman Sachs executives tremendous political influence.Nevertheless, Conway claimed that they  don t have influence over him politically and they will not have influence over him politically in the White House. However, Trump has said that Goldman Sachs  owns  Ted Cruz because he took loans from them. But that logic backfired because it turns out Trump has also taken loans from Goldman Sachs, which according to Trump means they own him. And now three of them are in Trump s cabinet.Todd once again cornered Conway and demanded answers.First, he wanted to know how she would react if Hillary Clinton had won and appointed three Goldman Sachs alums. She claimed that she wouldn t have whined about but we all know Trump and all of his supporters would be throwing a collective temper tantrum.The Todd wondered,  Was the trashing of Goldman just simply campaign rhetoric and sort of B.S.? The answer is yes but Conway again went with the whole  he was just talking about political influence  line, and Todd refused to let Conway get away with that bullshit. Those are political appointments!  Todd exclaimed.But the facts don t matter to team Trump, and Conway simply kept talking and talking and talking to run out the clock and force Todd to move one to the next topic.Here s the video via YouTube.Once again, Donald Trump gets caught being a complete hypocrite and his team spews bullshit to defend him. These people have no shame and their supporters should be pissed.Featured Image: Screenshot",Fake
"Pro-Trump groups take no prisoners in rush to help an embattled president WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Flush with cash, political groups outside the White House are aggressively coming to President Donald Trumpâ€™s aid as he battles low public approval numbers, questions about his election campaignâ€™s ties to Russia and a stalled legislative agenda. Through television attack ads and online campaigns normally seen only during the tumult of an election, the groups are helping Trump to strike back against his perceived enemies and boost his agenda, adding to the firepower of his Twitter account and the bully pulpit of the White House. On Tuesday, one of the groups, America First Policies, launched an attack ad against a senator from Trumpâ€™s own Republican Party who had balked at a Senate plan to overhaul healthcare that would leave millions more Americans uninsured. The attack angered Senate leader Mitch McConnell, who is struggling to rustle up the votes for the plan. It is the first time that a U.S. president has had Super PACs - political action committees that can raise unlimited amounts of money and typically operate during elections - or political non-profits, which do not have to disclose their donors or where they spend their money, actively working to support him after the dust of campaigning has cleared.  The pro-Trump groups are prohibited from coordinating with the White House, which declined to comment for this story. The New York Times reported that McConnell had complained to White House chief of staff Reince Priebus about America First Policiesâ€™ ad. The group later pulled the ad. America First Policies and the other pro-Trump groups were set up to promote Trump and his legislative agenda - healthcare reform, building a wall along the Mexican border, and pushing for lower taxation and deregulation. They are not allied to the Republican Party, which can pose a problem for Republican leaders as Tuesdayâ€™s attack ad showed. With Trumpâ€™s approval ratings sagging and his agenda now overshadowed by a federal investigation into his 2016 campaignâ€™s ties to Russia, the groups are pouring resources into protecting Trumpâ€™s image, demonizing his opponents and amplifying his message that he is the victim of a witch-hunt. â€œThe establishment is shaken, angry, losing control,â€ begins another new ad by America First Policies, which says on its website that it is a non-profit organization â€œsupporting key policy initiatives.â€ Images of the U.S. Capitol, Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and liberal MSNBC host Rachel Maddow flash in the background.  â€œDesperately waging an all-out war to protect their interest,â€ the narrator continues. â€œThey lie, they leak, they leech onto power.â€ America First Policies is comprised of more traditionally conservative RepublicansÂ and was founded after the election by a close ally of Vice President Mike Pence, Nick Ayers.Â  The group said in a statement their mission was to promote Trumpâ€™s agenda and that they were not afraid to push House Republicans through grassroots and advertising to support the healthcare overhaul. The groupsâ€™ shift from policy promotion to attack mode, does not surprise Marjorie Hershey, a political science professor at Indiana University. â€œA lot of research tells us that negative ads tend to be more attention-getting than positive ads, and because Super PACs themselves arenâ€™t on the ballot, they can afford to risk the unsavory reputation that negative advertisers often get,â€ Hershey said.  Strategists and political scientists say it is hard to know if the groups are actually moving public opinion. But the groups point to their fundraising as evidence of their success â€“ much of it raised not from millionaires, but in small donations from voters. â€œGreat America Allianceâ€ - which was set up as a sister organization to a Super PAC created by Trump supporters Rudy Giuliani and Newt Gingrich - has spent $400,000 on an ad attacking former FBI Director James Comey, the groupâ€™s director, Eric Beach, told Reuters.     The video tried to discredit Comey, who was fired by Trump over his handling of the Russia probe, the week he testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee. â€œJust another DC insider in it for himself,â€ the ad concludes. The group launched a new ad this week featuring conservative media star Tomi Lahren attacking Robert Mueller, the special counsel now leading the Russia investigation. Mueller is investigating whether Trump may have attempted to obstruct justice by pressuring Comey to drop his inquiry.  On its website the group says its mission is â€œto advocate for a stronger economy, a more secure nation, and a society with less government intrusion and more freedom for American citizens.â€ Asked to reconcile its stated mission with the attack ads, the groupâ€™s director, Eric Beach, said, â€œOur goal is to really get on the ground and fight back. Our supporters want to get out there and fight ... the mischaracterization of not just Donald Trumpâ€™s rhetoric but also his policies.â€  Alison Dagnes, a political science professor at Shippensburg University who specializes in Super PACS, said the well-resourced groups play a key role in spreading Trumpâ€™s message that what his supporters are reading or seeing in the media is false.  â€œTheyâ€™re saying we see whatâ€™s happening now and you shouldnâ€™t believe it.â€ The Committee to Defend the President, another Super PAC, launched an ad calling on supporters to â€œdefendâ€ Trump. The groupâ€™s leader, Ted Harvey, said unfair attacks on Trump had forced his group to shift their focus to defending the president instead of promoting his policies.  â€œCertainly, I would rather be talking about policies than talking about made-up lies that the Democrats and the mainstream media cabal have put together to discredit the administration from moving forward on its agenda,â€ said Harvey.

"Trump on Hurricane Irma: 'This is some big monster' WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump called Hurricane Irma â€œsome big monsterâ€ as it battered the Florida coast, saying he wanted to go to the state very soon and praising emergency officials for their efforts to protect people. â€œThe bad news is that this is some big monster,â€ Trump told reporters at the White House, saying damage from the storm would be very costly. â€œRight now, we are worried about lives, not cost,â€ Trump said after returning from Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland where he monitored the storm and met with his Cabinet. The path of the storm, tracking the west coast of Florida, meant it might be less destructive than it would otherwise have been, Trump said, noting the next five or six hours would be critical. â€œI hope there arenâ€™t too many people in the path,â€ he said. â€œYou donâ€™t want to be in that path.â€  The U.S. House of Representatives canceled votes scheduled for Monday because of the hurricane. Trump said the U.S. Coast Guard had been heroic and that the Federal Emergency Management Agency was doing a good job to help coordinate the response with states. He added, however: â€œI think the hard part is now beginning.â€ Trump has offered the full resources of the federal government to Florida and the affected states, Vice President Mike Pence told reporters during a visit to FEMAâ€™s Washington headquarters on Sunday. â€œWherever Hurricane Irma goes, weâ€™ll be there first,â€ Pence said. â€œWeâ€™ll be there with resources and support, both to save lives and to help to recover and rebuild these states and these communities.â€ On Sunday, Trump also issued a disaster declaration for the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, and expanded federal funds available to the U.S. Virgin Islands in the aftermath of Irma, the White House said. Trump owns a resort in Palm Beach, Florida, where he has often traveled during his presidency, as well as three golf courses in the state. He told reporters he hoped to travel to the state soon. â€œWeâ€™re going to Florida very soon,â€ Trump said. ",Real
" John Boehner Has A New Job, And Itâ€™s Vile (VIDEO) When John Boehner left Congress, he left behind a stench so bad it took a team of professionals and a hefty chunk of change to get rid of it. No, I m not talking about his obstructionism. I m talking about the fact that Boehner is a massive chain smoker, and his office reeked so bad that Paul Ryan had to have new carpets, furniture and paint in his new office.Now, Boehner has found a new home, and it can only be imagined that the entire building stinks just like Boehner s old office. He s now a Class 2 director on the board of Reynolds American Inc, the company that makes his beloved Camel cigarettes. Yes, his job will be to lobby Congress to help prevent and eliminate those pesky regulations that tobacco companies have to jump through   you know, like the ones that say the tobacco companies can t market to children, although a Boehner spokesman spun it to sound like just the opposite. RAI is striving to transform the tobacco industry through innovative strategies that include speeding the decline in tobacco use among young people and reducing the harm caused by smoking,  said a Boehner spokesman.  These are objectives Speaker Boehner supports and looks forward to helping RAI advance through his service on the board. Source: NPRHere s the video:The reality is much bleaker. There is a tiny grain of truth in the statement that fewer young people are using tobacco, but one of the things tobacco companies are trying to sell as a safer alternative to tobacco are e-cigarettes, which for children, are even worse than traditional cigarettes, just because the cartridge can be broken and children have been known to swallow toxic doses of nicotine.Not only that, tobacco companies are specifically marketing e-cigarettes to young children, often with ads touting their candy-like flavors.If you recall, Boehner stepped down from his speakership and announced that he would be leaving Congress immediately after a congressional visit from Pope Francis. He seemed to imply that the Pope had put the  pro-life  Speaker into a crisis of conscious. In truth, Republicans wanted him out, badly, but what happened to the man who claimed his life was changed after meeting the Pope?Nothing that the Pope would approve of. Smoking is still the leading cause of preventable death in this country. Nearly half a million Americans die from smoking ever year. While not as many children are picking up cigarettes, hence the panic and the hiring of Boehner, more than 3,200 new smokers each day are younger than 18. Of those, 2,100 will become addicts. This is what John Boehner is promoting. He s almost better back in Congress. At least there, he got nothing done. Now, he ll be personally responsible for the deaths of millions and he ll be pushing cigarettes on children.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images.",Fake
" Trump Just Threw The WORST Insult YET Out To The White House Press Corps Donald Trump hates the press, unless the press is the far-right wing rags that kiss his ass nonstop, and report only what he likes. On Friday, Sean Spicer held a press gaggle in his office and included some of those rags, while excluding established media outlets with long histories in the White House. The AP and TIME Magazine boycotted the gaggle in solidarity with The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, CNN and Politico.CNN and The New York Times hit back pretty hard, and the White House Correspondents  Association likewise hit back. Now, with the White House Correspondents  dinner coming up in a couple of months, Trump is yet again insulting the press. He just announced on Twitter he s not going to attend the dinner this year.I will not be attending the White House Correspondents  Association Dinner this year. Please wish everyone well and have a great evening!  Donald J.

Trump, however, is at war with the press as evidenced not just by Spicer s treatment of certain media outlets, but also by his own speech at CPAC, where he railed against the  fake news  media.He does it all the time on Twitter, too, and some press outlets are getting tired of it.As far as the dinner, CNN and MSNBC have indicated that they might not attend this year. Vanity Fair and The New Yorker have both announced they won t be there. A list of attendees hasn t been published yet, but we can probably expect more outlets to refuse to attend even if Trump isn t going to be there.Featured image by Olivier Douliery via Getty Images",Fake
"Trump embraces Democrats again on debt ceiling and immigration WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Thursday embraced a suggestion from the Senateâ€™s top Democrat to end congressional battles over the U.S. debt ceiling, a day after he stunned fellow Republicans by striking a major budget deal with the opposition party. Testing his new opening with Democrats, Trump also reached out on another tricky issue, the fate of 800,000 so-called Dreamers, young adults brought illegally to the country as children. He even honored a request by Nancy Pelosi, the top House of Representatives Democrat, to publicly reassure the Dreamers they do not face imminent deportation. The Senate voted 80-17 to approve the deal Trump reached with Democrats on Wednesday, which would raise the federal debt limit and fund the government through Dec. 8. The legislation included $15.25 billion in aid for areas affected by Hurricane Harvey and other natural disasters. The bill now goes to the House for final congressional approval, where it faces opposition from conservatives who traditionally favor raising the ceiling while also cutting spending. Representative Bill Flores, a Republican helping round up votes for the deal, said his count of party members intending to vote yes on the legislation â€œdidnâ€™t look very good.â€ Trump voiced support on Thursday for the idea of eliminating the statutory cap on the U.S. Treasury Departmentâ€™s authority to borrow. â€œFor many years, people have been talking about getting rid of debt ceiling altogether, and there are a lot of good reasons to do that,â€ Trump told reporters. â€œIt complicates things, itâ€™s really not necessary.â€ â€œSo certainly thatâ€™s something that will be discussed,â€ he added. Legislation that would end the need for Congress to regularly authorize debt ceiling increases came up during a White House meeting Trump had on Wednesday with Pelosi, top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, people familiar with the meeting said. Schumer proposed eliminating the limit, and Trump and Vice President Mike Pence said they liked the idea, one source said. Schumer said the parties should canvass rank-and-file lawmakers to gauge support for getting rid of the ceiling ahead of the next deadline to raise it, in December, the source said. The meetingâ€™s participants did not say whether they would seek to repeal the cap or revert to a practice of automatic increases tied to Congress approving its annual budget, the sources said. Republican Ryan said he opposed any effort to do away with lawmakersâ€™ role in approving debt limit increases, citing the powers given to Congress under the U.S. Constitution. The United States spends more than it raises through taxes and other revenue, and issues debt to make up the difference. The limit on how much it can borrow is the debt ceiling. Congress must regularly vote to raise the cap, which frequently sparks nasty political fights that spook financial markets over the prospect of an unprecedented U.S. default. Representative Barry Loudermilk, a member of the conservative Republican Study Committee, said the proposal to scrap the debt ceiling was worth exploring. â€œThis is something that just comes up over and over again and weâ€™ve never done anything to fix it,â€ he said, adding lawmakers should have a conversation about finding a permanent fix that also leads to cutting deficit spending, such as a constitutional amendment to balance the budget.  But Republican Representative Joe Barton, who belongs to the partyâ€™s right-wing Freedom Caucus, said scrapping the debt ceiling was wrong and he hoped Trump â€œreconsiders his position.â€ Schumer said on Thursday he hoped the meeting was â€œa ray of hope for both parties coming together on the big issues.â€ Pelosi said Trump also made clear he wanted Congress to act on the Dreamers issue. U.S. lawmakers for years have failed to pass comprehensive immigration reform legislation. On Tuesday, Trump rescinded a program created by his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, that protected the immigrants from deportation and provided them work permits. Trump gave Congress six months to work on an alternative by delaying implementation until March.  Democrats want a bill addressing the Dreamers without other issues attached, but Pelosi did not rule out including border security measures that Trump and Ryan want. Pelosi said â€œwe have a responsibility to secure our borders,â€ but that does not include Trumpâ€™s planned wall along the U.S.-Mexico border that many Democrats oppose. â€œWe want to do it as soon as possible to strike while the iron is hot, because public opinion is so much in favor,â€ Pelosi told reporters. Pelosi said she told Trump the Dreamers needed his assurance he was not planning a six-month-long roundup for deportation. Trump subsequently wrote on Twitter: â€œFor all of those (DACA) that are concerned about your status during the 6 month period, you have nothing to worry about - No action!â€  ",Real

" WATCH: Jake Tapper SLAMS Trump Campaign Manager For Touting Fake â€˜Assassination Attemptâ€™ By now, the only people in the world who still think Trump was the target of an assassination on Saturday are his supporters and campaign staff.That was certainly the case on Sunday morning as Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway refused to acknowledge that Austyn Crites was NOT carrying a gun during a Trump rally and was merely trying to hold up an anti-Trump sign.Tapper began by pointing out the facts and then reported that Trump supporter Dan Scavino and one of Trump s sons are retweeting misinformation about the incident in an effort to claim that there actually was a real assassination attempt. It s not an assassination attempt,  Tapper repeated before asking Conway,  Should they be spreading this misinformation? Of course, Conway tried to capitalize on the incident by bragging about how  nimble  and  resilient  Trump is, even though Secret Service agents were the ones who got Trump off stage and he retreated from a guy who was just holding up a sign. To Conway, the guy holding the sign was  scary  and she proceeded to smear him and ignore the fact that there was no assassination attempt. It s scary. All the coverage is usually about our protesters wreaking havoc and making people feel afraid. And it certainly goes both ways. I m with Mr. Trump and the Secret Service routinely. They do an amazing job. I also want to point out because some people are spreading misinformation about the protester. He had canvassed for Hillary Clinton and he had donated to her campaign. So, this is a Democratic plant or operative trying to disrupt our rally. And I think people saw a nimble resilient Donald Trump who would be nimble and resilient as president as well. Tapper responded by calling Conway out. Except it wasn t an assassination attempt. It was apparently a local voter, a Republican who says he is supporting Hillary Clinton. He has given money to Hillary Clinton. He has canvassed for Hillary Clinton. But he says he s a Republican. But most importantly, he was not trying to assassinate anyone. This was not an assassination attempt, but why is your campaign spreading that it was? That s really remarkable that that s what the storyline is here,  Conway whined before trying to bargain with CNN.

"Trump greets Japanese emperor with a handshake and nod - but no bow TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump greeted Japanese Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko on Monday with a genteel handshake and nod, but no bow, avoiding the pitfall of U.S. President Barack Obama who was criticized at home for his deep bow to the monarch. Trump, wearing a suit and tie and his wife, Melania, in a long, dark blue dress, were met at the palace entrance by the royal couple, who were both wearing suits. Trump smiled, shook hands and nodded at the 83-year-old emperor before greeting Michiko as well. The four entered the palace where they chatted through interpreters in footage aired live on television, but without sound as is customary. After the meeting, Trump shook hands again, and tapped the emperorâ€™s arm repeatedly with his left hand. â€œThank you for the great meetingâ€, he told Akihito. â€œIâ€™m sure we will meet againâ€. Obama came under fire after meeting the emperor in Tokyo in 2009 for what his critics back home said was bowing too low to Akihito. Some U.S. commentators said the U.S. president should not lower his head before foreign monarchs. Akihito has spent much of his reign working to heal the wounds of World War II, which was waged across Asia in his fatherâ€™s name, Emperor Hirohito. Obama also faced criticism from a different quarter - etiquette experts - who noted he combined a bow with an handshake, which is not done in Japan traditionally, whetherÂ meeting the emperor or anyone else. Japanese guests are not supposed to touch the royal couple or shake hands, but foreign guests often do. Hillary Clinton shook hands and air-kissed the empress on both cheeks, then took her hand as they entered the palace when she met the royal pair as secretary of state in 2011, a month or so after the triple disasters of an earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown hit northeastern Japan in March of that year. Traditionalists say that Japanâ€™s Chrysanthemum throne dates back more than 2,000 years. Akihito was the first royal heir in the Japanese imperial family to marry a commoner â€” a symbol of Japanâ€™s new modernity and confidence. Japan earlier this year enacted a law clearing the way for Akihito, to step down, clearing the way for the first abdication by a Japanese monarch in nearly two centuries and the accession of his son, Crown Prince Naruhito in late 2018 early 2019. Akihitoâ€™s father, Emperor Hirohito, was considered divine until after Japanâ€™s defeat in World War Two. The current emperor is defined by the constitution as a symbol of the people, and has no political authority although he is widely respected. ",Real
" Democrat Examines Trumpâ€™s Latest Twitter Meltdown, Asks The ONE Question We Were ALL Wondering (DETAILS) Donald Trump s presidency is still one of the most baffling train wrecks Americans have seen in a long time. If his racist, misogynist rhetoric and pathological lying weren t enough to raise concerns about, his Twitter activity alone should have prevented people from voting for him   and for those that had hope for him, he s been busy proving them wrong every single day since he got in the White House.He hasn t even lasted a month in his new role yet, and already people are scrambling to find ways to get rid of him before he destroys the country. With his massive amounts of inhumane executive orders and reckless handling of world affairs, Trump s mental competency is under scrutiny   and for good reason.On Saturday, Trump launched into one of his insane Twitter fits, and this time he was more incoherent than ever. He not only whined about  FAKE NEWS  and the New York Times, but he attacked the  so-called judge  who dared to block his disgusting Muslim ban. Oh, and let s not forget about the fact that Trump also shared a fake article about Kuwait, forcing the country to respond and the situation to erupt in chaos before the situation was corrected.Given the emotional roller coaster that the Trump presidency has already become in such a short amount of time, many people are calling for him to have a psychological review   and one of those people is Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA), who took a look at Trump s Twitter tantrum and asked the question we ve all been wanting to know. Here it is: Should he get a mental health exam? Hell YES. A few hours later, Lieu fired back at Trump again for posting yet another weird, narcissistic tweet: his campaign slogan,  Make America Great Again. It would be in America s best interest if Trump were professionally evaluated. Lieu is not the only politician calling for a psychological review, either. Earlier this week, top Democrat Nancy Pelosi spoke out in support of having mental evaluations for presidents   which we all know would have destroyed every chance Trump had.Like him or hate him, Trump is not well and being in his role is not only dangerous for him, but for the rest of the world.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images",Fake
"FBI chief sees no evidence of White House interference in Russia probe WASHINGTON (Reuters) - FBI Director Christopher Wray said on Thursday he has â€œnot detected any whiff of interferenceâ€ by the White House into the ongoing investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Speaking publicly for the first time since being confirmed as head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Wray also expressed confidence in Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating whether President Donald Trumpâ€™s campaign colluded with Russia during the election. â€œI can say very confidently that I have not detected any whiff of interference with that investigation,â€ Wray said during a panel discussion at the Intelligence and National Security Summit in Washington.  Wray was installed as FBI director after his predecessor, James Comey, was fired by Trump in May. In an interview with NBC after Comeyâ€™s removal, Trump admitted he was thinking about â€œthis Russia thingâ€ when he decided to fire the then-FBI chief. Comey later told Congress he believed Trump had tried to get him to drop an FBI probe into former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, as part of the broader Russia investigation - testimony that has raised questions about whether Trump was potentially trying to obstruct justice. The White House has repeatedly denied the Trump campaign colluded with Russia in the election. Trumpâ€™s advisers and allies also have questioned Muellerâ€™s independence and credibility, with some pointing out that he has hired attorneys who have given political donations to Democrats. But Wray said he has â€œenormous respectâ€ for Mueller, who is also a former FBI director. He stressed that Mueller is running the probe but said the FBI is assisting by dedicating agents and providing other support to the investigation. Wray also reiterated his confidence in a January report compiled by U.S. intelligence agencies which concluded that Russia had interfered in the 2016 election and tried to tilt it in Trumpâ€™s favor - a finding Trump has often questioned. Prior to his confirmation as FBI director, Wray had only read a non-classified version of the report. â€œI have no reason to doubt the conclusions that the hard- working people who put that together came to,â€ Wray said.

" Pence On Aircraft Carrier Lie: No, It Wasnâ€™t Strategy, Weâ€™re Just Morons The White House led people to believe that a U.S. aircraft carrier was on his way to the waters off the Korean peninsula in a show of military strength. White House press secretary said,  I think when you see a carrier group steaming into an area like that, the forward presence of that is clearly, through almost every instance, a huge deterrence,  he said, adding that it  gives the President options in the region.  However, none of that is true because the U.S. aircraft carrier was traveling in the opposite direction.According to vice-president Mike Pence, the claims of the location of the U.S. aircraft carrier supposedly on its way off the Korean peninsula were not made intentionally. Or in reality, he s saying the White House doesn t know how to communicate because it s so inept, or perhaps, Trump used this to bolster his alleged presidency so that his first 100 days in office won t appear to be a complete disaster.Politico reports:Earlier this month, White House and Pentagon officials announced that the USS Carl Vinson and its accompanying battle group had been deployed off the coast of the Korean peninsula, a response to a missile test launched by North Korea. But on Monday, Defense News reported that the Carl Vinson was nowhere near the Korean peninsula and had instead been photographed near Indonesia.After reports from major outlets saying that the Carl Vinson had not immediately turned north towards the Korean peninsula, government officials were left having to explain why the aircraft carrier had not been deployed as initially described.Pence was asked during an interview with CNN if the remarks from White House and Pentagon officials had been intentional and the vice-president said,  oh, I think not  then went on to say there was already a strong U.S. military presence in the Asia-Pacific region, including in Japan and South Korea. Pence did not explain why government officials declared that the that the strike group was  steaming up toward the sea of Japan. Here is Sean Spicer saying exactly that on Monday:CNN interviewed Pence aboard the USS Ronald Reagan at the U.S. Yokosuka naval base in Tokyo Bay and addressed the crew saying that the U.S. would  work diligently  with allies to maintain and increase pressure on North Korea. The United States of America will always seek peace but under President Trump, the shield stands guard and the sword stands ready,  Pence said.  Those who would challenge our resolve or readiness should know, we will defeat any attack and meet any use of conventional or nuclear weapons with an overwhelming and effective American response. The word  effective  doesn t mean what Pence thinks it means.Just one week after the announcement that the carrier was off the Korean peninsula, an official Navy photo showed that the strike group was actually farther away from the claimed location than it had been at the time of the announcement.Photo by Aaron P.

Perhaps he remembered how disgusting Trump s behavior was while he was running against him in the primaries, so the look on Rubio s face said it all.

"Trump retains Marc Kasowitz as private attorney for Russia probe: source  (This May 23 story corrects name to Fox Business Network in second paragraph) By Julia Edwards Ainsley WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump has tapped a longtime legal adviser to serve as his private attorney while a special counsel investigates whether his campaign worked with Russia in last yearâ€™s election, a source familiar with the decision told Reuters Tuesday.  Fox Business Network and ABC first reported that Trump hired Marc Kasowitz, a New York-based trial lawyer known as a tenacious litigator, to represent him in a Justice Department investigation headed by former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Robert Mueller. The appointment of a private attorney may indicate that Trump is seriously considering the impact the federal investigation could have on him personally and that he may wish to protect himself should others in his administration turn against him. The source said Kasowitz is expected to bring other lawyers on to work as a team to protect Trump.  Other candidates for the job, including Brendan Sullivan and Robert Giuffra, withdrew their names from consideration, the source said.  â€œHe can be aggressive - heâ€™s got that in him for sure,â€ said John Quinn of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart and Sullivan, who has worked with and opposite Kasowitz. â€œHe also can be smooth as silk, respectful and deferential.â€  Kasowitz and the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters. Kasowitz has represented Trump for more than 15 years but he is not known as a criminal defense lawyer. During last yearâ€™s presidential campaign, Kasowitz threatened to sue the New York Times if it did not retract a story about women who accused Trump of touching them inappropriately. The Times did not retract the story. He also assisted in the defense of fraud claims against Trump University, a series of real-estate seminars. After the election, Trump settled the claims for $25 million. Trump has looked to Kasowitzâ€™s firm to fill positions in his administration. He has described former Senator Joseph Lieberman, a senior counsel at the firm, as a top candidate to serve as FBI director and is considering Edward McNally, a white-collar defense lawyer at the firm, as the next U.S. attorney in Manhattan. A former partner at the firm, David Friedman, was chosen by Trump as U.S. ambassador to Israel. Kasowitz also represents OJSC Sberbank of Russia, the countryâ€™s largest bank, which is being accused in a U.S. federal court of conspiring with granite company executives and others to raid the assets of a competitor.  The outside counsel would be separate from the White House Counselâ€™s Office, led by Donald McGahn. Mueller was appointed as special counsel by the Justice Department last week to investigate the Trump campaignâ€™s possible ties to Russia. Several congressional committees and the FBI are also investigating the matter. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in January that Moscow tried to sway the November vote in Trumpâ€™s favor. Russia has denied involvement, and Trump has denied any collusion between his campaign and Russia. Controversy has engulfed Trump since he fired FBI Director James Comey two weeks ago as Comey oversaw an investigation into possible collusion between his presidential campaign and Russia. ",Real
"Manafort tried to pen positive op-ed on Ukraine work: special counsel WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The special counsel investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election on Monday accused President Donald Trumpâ€™s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, of working with a Russian colleague to draft an opinion piece about his political work for Ukraine. In court filings, a prosecutor working with Special Counsel Robert Muellerâ€™s team said Manafort was working on the article as recently as Nov. 30. Had it been published, prosecutors say it would have violated a Nov. 8 court order not to discuss the case publicly.  The Russian colleague who was working with Manafort allegedly to shape public opinion about his work for a Ukrainian political party has ties to Russian intelligence agencies, according to the filing.  Manafort ultimately never published the opinion piece, after prosecutors reached out to his attorneys to alert them, they said in the filing.  Due to Manafortâ€™s actions, prosecutors said the judge should reject his request to modify his bail conditions.  Manafort has proposed an $11.65 million bail package in exchange for lifting him from house arrest and electronic monitoring.   As part of that deal, he would forfeit four of his real estate properties if he violated his bail conditions. â€œEven if the ghost-written op-ed were entirely accurate, fair and balanced, it would be a violation of this courtâ€™s November 8 order if it had been published,â€ wrote prosecutor Andrew Weissmann.  A spokesman for Manafort did not have any immediate comment.  Manafort and his business associate Rick Gates were both indicted in October in a 12-count indictment by a federal grand jury. They face charges including conspiracy to launder money, conspiracy against the United States and failing to register as foreign agents of Ukraineâ€™s former pro-Russian government. Initially, Manafortâ€™s lawyers had said in their court filing that the special counselâ€™s office was willing to accept the proposed terms of his release.  But prosecutors wrote that they can no longer trust Manafort, and cannot accept his proposed terms. â€œBecause Manafort has now taken actions that reflect an intention to violate or circumvent the courtâ€™s existing orders, at a time one would expect particularly scrupulous adherence, the government submits that the proposed bail package is insufficient,â€ the filing said.

"Pope hopes Trump re-thinks DACA decision on immigrant children ABOARD THE PAPAL PLANE (Reuters) - Pope Francis said he hoped U.S. President Donald Trump would re-think his decision to end a program protecting undocumented immigrant children, saying it was important for young people to have roots. â€œOne hopes that it is re-thought somewhat,â€ Francis said on Sunday in answer to a question on the plane returning from Colombia about the program started by his predecessor and known as Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals (DACA). He spoke about DACA and the problems of immigrant families in general, adding that he wanted to learn more about Trumpâ€™s decision. Trumpâ€™s move this month to end the five-year-old program instituted by former President Barack Obama plunged almost 800,000 young people, known as â€œDreamers,â€ into uncertainty. It drew criticism from business and religious leaders, mayors, governors, Democratic lawmakers, unions and civil liberties advocates. Trump said during his election campaign he would end DACA if he became president. Last week, 15 states and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit challenging Trumpâ€™s decision. It claims his decision was â€œmotivated, at least in part, by a discriminatory motiveâ€ against Mexicans, who are the largest beneficiary of the program. It points to his statements from the 2016 presidential campaign.. â€œIn the end, young people feel like they have no hope. And who robs them of hope? Drugs, other addictions, suicides - youth suicides are very high - and this happens when they are torn from their roots,â€ Francis said. â€œThe relationship between a young person and his roots is very important. Young people who have been uprooted today are asking for help,â€ he said. He appeared to take a swipe at Trump when he said: â€œThe president of the United States ... presents himself as a man who is pro-life. If he is a good pro-lifer, he understands that the family is the cradle of life and you have to defend its unity.â€ The pope has already clashed with Trump over immigration issues, such as the presidentâ€™s intention to build a wall on the border with Mexico and deport undocumented aliens. Francis, the first Latin American pope, has made defense of immigrants a major plank of his papacy. The pontiff said during the presidential campaign that a man who thought about building walls and not bridges was â€œnot Christianâ€. Trump, who grew up in a Presbyterian family, shot back saying it was â€œâ€˜disgracefulâ€ for the pope to question his faith. Trump met the pope at the Vatican during a tour of the Middle East and Europe last May. ",Real
"Senator McCain suggests subpoena to make White House cyber aide testify WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senator John McCain suggested on Thursday that the Senate Armed Services Committee, the powerful congressional panel he chairs, may consider issuing a subpoena to make the White Houseâ€™s top cyber security official testify. White House cyber security coordinator Rob Joyce did not appear before the committee on Thursday, as requested, to discuss cyber threats facing the United States. His vacant seat drew frustration from lawmakers in both parties. Senator Bill Nelson, a Democrat on the panel, urged McCain to consider a subpoena to compel Joyce to appear. â€œI think that needs to be discussed in committee,â€ McCain said. In a statement, a White House spokesman said it has been â€œlongstanding practiceâ€ of presidents of both parties to not make White House advisers available for congressional testimony. â€œThis practice is rooted in the separation of powers and in the confidentiality interests of the executive branch,â€ the spokesman said. â€œOfficials from relevant departments and agencies are available to accommodate the committeeâ€™s legitimate oversight needs without violating the confidentiality interests that attach to White House staff.â€ McCain countered, however, that the absence was a â€œmisinterpretationâ€ of the presidentâ€™s executive authority to have private counsel. Several other senators expressed frustration at Joyceâ€™s absence.  â€œThe empty chair is outrageous,â€ Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill said. â€œI am disgusted there is not a representative here.â€ ",Real
"U.S. allies show support for strikes on Syria (Reuters) - U.S. allies expressed support on Friday for Washingtonâ€™s missile strikes on Syria, calling them a proportionate response to Syrian forcesâ€™ suspected use of chemical weapons.  The strikes were denounced as illegal by Syria and its allies Russia and Iran. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani called on the world ""to reject such policies, which bring only destruction and danger to the region and the globe"". (Graphic locator map on attack - tmsnrt.rs/2nm68H0)  Iraq criticized â€œhasty interventionsâ€ in an apparent comment on the U.S. action. But a wide range of U.S. allies from Asia, Europe and the Middle East expressed support, if sometimes cautiously, in similar terms. â€œThe U.K. government fully supports the U.S. action, which we believe was an appropriate response to the barbaric chemical weapons attack launched by the Syrian regime and is intended to deter further attacks,â€ a British government spokesman said. Japanâ€™s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters: â€œMany innocent people became victims from the chemical attacks. â€œJapan supports the U.S. governmentâ€™s determination to prevent the spread and use of chemical weapons,â€ he said. Turkey viewed the strikes positively and the international community should sustain its stance against the â€œbarbarityâ€ of the Syrian government, Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus said. In an interview with Turkish broadcaster Fox TV, Kurtulmus said Assadâ€™s government must be punished in the international arena and the peace process in Syria needed to be accelerated. French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said Russia and Iran needed to understand that supporting Assad made no sense and that the escalation of the U.S. military role in Syria was a â€œwarningâ€ to â€œa criminal regimeâ€. â€œUse of chemical weapons is appalling and should be punished because it is a war crime,â€ Ayrault told Reuters and France Info radio. French President Francois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel issued statements saying Assad was solely to blame for the air strikes. The Dutch government said: â€œThe United States has given a clear signal that the use of poison gas crosses a line.â€ It also labeled the strikes a â€œproportionateâ€ response. â€œU.S. strikes show needed resolve against barbaric chemical attacks. EU will work with the US to end brutality in Syria,â€ the chairman of the council of EU leaders, Donald Tusk, said on Twitter. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said the strikes sent â€œa vitallyÂ important messageâ€ that the world would notÂ tolerate the use of chemicalÂ weapons. â€œThe retribution has been proportionate and it has been swift,â€ he told reporters in Sydney. â€œWe support the United States in thatÂ swift action.â€ Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which back rebels fighting Assad, said they supported the U.S. strikes and held only the Syrian government responsible for the attacks. Other Gulf countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Kuwait, also expressed support for the attacks.  Some countries expressed reservations about the U.S. decision to launch strikes without authorization from the U.N. Security Council. Indonesia, home to the worldâ€™s largest Muslim population, condemned the use of chemical weapons in Syria. â€œAt the same time, Indonesia is concerned with unilateral actions by any parties, including the use of Tomahawk missiles, in responding to the chemical weapon attack tragedy in Syria,â€ Foreign Ministry spokesman Armanatha Nasir said in a text message. â€œMilitary actions, undertaken without prior authorization of the U.N. Security Council, are not in line with international legal principles in the peaceful settlement of disputes, as stipulated in the U.N. Charter.â€ ",Real

"Maryland, District of Columbia sue over payments to Trump hotels (Reuters) - The attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit on Monday claiming that government payments to President Donald Trumpâ€™s businesses violate the U.S. Constitution. Payments to the presidentâ€™s enterprises from foreign and domestic governments through his hospitality empire draw business away from Maryland and D.C. venues and put local governments under pressure to give Trump-owned businesses special treatment, according to the complaint.  Foreign and domestic government payments to Trumpâ€™s businesses were the target of a similar lawsuit brought in January by plaintiffs including an ethics nonprofit group, and Democratic lawmakers have blasted them as potential corrupting influences on Trump. The Trump Organization has said it will donate profits from customers representing foreign governments to the U.S. Treasury but will not require the customers to identify themselves.  â€œEvery time the president has spoken about drawing a line between his presidency and his businesses, heâ€™s walked those promises back,â€ said D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine said at a news conference on Monday. The case by Racine and Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh, both Democrats, has a better chance in court as the first government action over allegations that Trump, a Republican, violated the Constitutionâ€™s so-called emoluments clauses, legal experts said.  Democratic attorneys general have taken a lead role in challenging Trump policies, successfully blocking executive orders restricting travel from some Muslim-majority countries.  The Maryland and D.C. attorneys general are seeking an order in U.S. District Court in Maryland preventing Trump from continuing to receive government payments beyond his salary.  White House press secretary Sean Spicer on Monday rejected the claim that Trumpâ€™s business interests violated the Constitution and said â€œpartisan politicsâ€ were behind the lawsuit. Trumpâ€™s lawyers will likely move to dismiss the case, he said. The Justice Department declined to comment.  Trumpâ€™s ownership in hundreds of businesses hurts Maryland and D.C. and violates â€œemolumentsâ€ clauses in the Constitution that bar the president from accepting gifts from foreign governments without congressional approval as well as from domestic governments under any circumstances, according to the  complaint.  While Trump turned over management of the umbrella Trump Organization in January to a trust controlled by his two elder sons, he still owns his businesses, including the Trump International Hotel in Washington, and can draw revenue from them at any time. The attorneys general argued they had standing to sue Trump because their citizens will be harmed if payments to Trump are used to influence his allocation of federal funds. They also said local hospitality companies, including state-owned facilities, are being harmed.  The Justice Department on Friday argued in the other lawsuit that the plaintiffs lacked legal standing to sue because they cannot allege enough specific harm caused by Trumpâ€™s businesses.  The attorneys general have a better chance of establishing standing, legal scholars said, although they are divided over whether the AGs will ultimately succeed. Plaintiffs typically only have standing to file lawsuits under federal law if they can show they have been injured and a court ruling would remedy the harm.  Fordham Law School Professor Jed Shugerman said state governmentsâ€™ special duty to protect their citizens means they face a lower bar to standing in federal court, and the AG lawsuit should proceed.  However, Derek Muller, a professor at Pepperdine University School of Law, said it was unclear that this harm could be remedied by a favorable ruling.  The government has also said Trump hotel revenue does not fit the definition of an improper payment under the Constitution. Payments to Trumpâ€™s hotels do not qualify as a violation of the emoluments clause, which is intended to cover personal services performed by the president, the government said. â€œIf the Justice Department is correct, the emoluments clause has no meaning whatsoever,â€ said Frosh, the Maryland official.  â€œThe president can stand over here with his president of the United States hat and heâ€™s not allowed to take payments. But he takes a step over here and puts on his businessman hat, they can funnel as much money to him as they want.â€ ",Real

" ACLU Issues Shocking Warning: Itâ€™s Not Safe To Travel In Texas The Americal Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued a shocking warning on Tuesday: Thanks to the xenophobia of Donald Trump and his Republican cronies, it is no longer safe to travel in the state of Texas.The travel alert warns that  anyone planning to travel to Texas in the near future [should] anticipate the possible violation of their constitutional rights when stopped by law enforcement. The alert comes amid the passing of a Texas law known as SB4. The law gives a green light to police officers in the state to investigate a person s immigration status during a routine traffic stop, leading to widespread racial profiling, baseless scrutiny, and illegal arrests of citizens and non-citizens alike presumed to be  foreign  based on how they look or sound. The travel alert applies to all travelers to Texas, including U.S. travelers from other states and U.S. citizens. In addition, this alert applies to all encounters with federal, state, county law enforcement including local police and sheriffs.Constitutional rights no longer mean anything thanks to the hateful nature of Trump s administration. And Republicans, the very people who relentlessly scream about how important our  freedom  is, are ready to set a match to the Constitution as long as it gets rid of all those icky brown people. Even U.S. citizens aren t safe anymore. We plan to fight this racist and wrongheaded law in the courts and in the streets. Until we defeat it, everyone traveling in or to Texas needs to be aware of what s in store for them,  said Terri Burke, executive director of the ACLU of Texas.  The Lone Star State will become a  show me your papers  state, where every interaction with law enforcement can become a citizenship interrogation and potentially an illegal arrest. It is simply a matter of time before illegal arrests occur. Local law enforcement will have to decide between violating a person s rights and being severely fined, thrown in jail, or even being removed from office for choosing not to do so,  Burke added.Lorella Praeli, the ACLU s director of immigration policy and campaigns said, Everyone has constitutional rights in this country. The state of Texas, and every law enforcement officer, must respect those rights. The ACLU stands ready to safeguard those freedoms against those who seek to diminish them.

"Trump names interim consumer agency head, likely sparking showdown WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has designated White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau until a permanent director is nominated and confirmed, the White House said on Friday. The action came hours after Richard Cordray submitted his formal resignation and named a deputy director as his replacement, setting the stage for a political and legal battle over the regulatorâ€™s leadership. â€œThe president looks forward to seeing Director Mulvaney take a common sense approach to leading the CFPBâ€™s dedicated staff, an approach that will empower consumers to make their own financial decisions and facilitate investment in our communities,â€ the White House said in its statement. Democratic lawmakers are eager to preserve the regulator for as long as possible while Republicans want to put in place new leadership to chart a drastically different course.  The six-year-old bureau has policed consumer financial markets, drafting aggressive rules curbing products like payday loans, while issuing multimillion dollar fines against large financial institutions like Wells Fargo. But Republicans have consistently complained the agency is too powerful and lacks oversight from Congress on its operations, and they are eager to take control. Mulvaney, who has criticized the bureau in the past, said, â€œI look forward to working with the expert personnel within the agency to identify how the bureau can transition to be more effective in its mission, while becoming more accountable to the taxpayer.â€ The succession plan has never been tested, with Cordray as its first and only full-time director. Cordray had previously announced plans to resign by the end of November. In a statement to staff, he said that Leandra English, the CFPBâ€™s chief of staff, had been named deputy director and would take over as acting director of the agency upon his exit. However, the White House had already said it planned to name its own interim leadership at the regulator. Trump has pushed to ease regulations on businesses, including the financial sector, a stance seemingly at odds with Cordrayâ€™s more aggressive regulatory approach. Earlier this month, White House deputy press secretary Raj Shah said that the administration â€œwill announce an acting director and the presidentâ€™s choice to replace Mr Cordray at the appropriate time.â€ There are competing theories in Washington as to who can name Cordrayâ€™s replacement. Democrats point to language in the Dodd-Frank law that created the CFPB, stipulating the deputy director replaces the director when he or she leaves. But others say a separate law governing federal vacancies gives Trump power to name someone elsewhere in the administration to that role temporarily, while the White House identifies a full-time nominee who would be confirmed by the Senate.

"Trump could target 'carried interest' tax loophole: official WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administrationâ€™s push to overhaul tax laws might soon target a loophole used by some financial managers to lower their tax rates, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said on Sunday. President Donald Trump campaigned before the Nov. 8 election to eliminate the so-called â€œcarried interestâ€ loophole, which is used by many financial managers to lower tax obligations. But a rough outline for a major tax overhaul released last week failed to mention the loophole. Priebus, however, hinted that carried-interest could be on the chopping block and warned against analysts taking the view that financial managers would keep on benefiting from it. â€œThat balloon is going to get popped pretty quick,â€ Priebus told ABCâ€™s â€œThis Week.â€  â€œCarried interest is on the table,â€ he said. â€œThe president wants to get rid of carried interest so that balloon is not going to stay inflated very long, I assure you of that.â€ The carried interest rule allows financial managers at private equity, hedge fund and other firms to pay a capital gains tax rate on their income instead of the higher income tax rate. Trumpâ€™s tax overhaul plan would slash rates for businesses. Vice President Mike Pence told NBC â€œMeet the Pressâ€ on Sunday the plan might widen budget deficits â€œin the short term,â€ but faster economic growth would eventually lead to higher revenue.

"Co-leader of Germany's far-right AfD to quit in major blow BERLIN (Reuters) - Frauke Petry, co-leader of the far-right Alternative for Germany, said on Tuesday she was leaving the party in a major blow to its credibility just two days after it surged to third place in a national election. The anti-immigrant AfD won 12.6 percent of the vote in Germanyâ€™s election on Sunday, becoming the third-largest group in parliament and the first from the far-right to win seats in the Bundestag since the 1950s.  Petry, the highest-profile figure in the AfDâ€™s more moderate wing, had shocked other senior members by saying on Monday she would not sit with the AfD in the Bundestag (lower house) but rather as an independent member of parliament. Her husband, another senior AfD figure, is also leaving the party.  â€œWe tried to change course but you have to realize when you reach a point when that is no longer possible,â€ Petry, a 42-year-old chemist, told reporters in the eastern city of Dresden. â€œI have five children for whom I am responsible and ultimately you have to be able to look yourself in the mirror.â€ Petry has clashed with other senior members, arguing for the party to take a more moderate course to make it possible for it to join a coalition government. Her husband, Marcus Pretzell - head of the AfD in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) and also an MP in the European Parliament - is quitting the party and will become an independent MP, a spokesman for the AfD in NRW said. The spokesman said Pretzell and another AfD lawmaker in NRWâ€™s regional assembly who is also leaving the party had made the decision for reasons of â€œpersonal integrityâ€. On Monday, four of the 17 AfD lawmakers in the assembly of the eastern state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern announced they were bolting because the party had become more radical. Europeâ€™s far-right parties have a history of infighting among their various factions. Marine Le Pen, leader of Franceâ€™s National Front, last week lost her deputy over policy differences.  Alexander Gauland and Alice Weidel, the AfDâ€™s top candidates during the election campaign, were elected as chairs of the partyâ€™s parliamentary group on Tuesday. Gauland is a supporter of Bjoern Hoecke, a senior AfD member who has courted controversy by denying that Adolf Hitler was â€œabsolutely evilâ€ and calling Berlinâ€™s Holocaust Memorial a â€œmonument of shameâ€. Weidel was originally an opponent of Hoecke but has not been so critical of him lately. Weidel said she did not expect other lawmakers to quit the party but added: â€œWeâ€™ll have to see. The step surprised us all, but there are not yet any trends recognizable in the future parliamentary group.â€ Senior AfD member Dirk Driesang, who in July founded a moderate group within the AfD called the â€œAlternative Centreâ€, with which Petry was said to sympathize, told news magazine Der Spiegel that the group could not understand Petryâ€™s decision and would not be following in her footsteps. He said the group would continue to fight for the AfD to take a moderate course and added that â€œa spin-off from the AfD is a stillbirthâ€. Driesang pointed to the example of Bernd Lucke, who founded the AfD then left in 2015 due to what he saw as rising xenophobia and then formed a new, unsuccessful party. Petry was the most recognizable face in the AfD during its swift rise over the past two years. But she said on Monday she could not stand with an â€œanarchistic partyâ€ that lacked a credible plan to govern. For months, Petry has urged the AfD to soften its stance and prepare to join coalition governments, while others wanted the party to stick to opposition. Mainstream parties refuse to work with the AfD. She had also distanced herself from some of the AfDâ€™s more radical senior members, saying their comments were putting voters off. Gauland caused a scandal during the election campaign by saying Germans should be proud of their World War Two soldiers. He also said the integration minister should be â€œdisposed ofâ€ in Turkey, where her parents come from. As the AfD convened in Berlin on Tuesday for its first parliamentary group meeting, Gauland said discussions in the Bundestag would not echo those of the partyâ€™s campaign. â€œItâ€™s clear that the talks during the campaign are different to those held in parliament,â€ he said.

" Obama And THREE Other Presidents Dwarf Trumpâ€™s Inaugural Audience, And These Numbers PROVE It Trump and his minions act like they re dead certain his inaugural numbers broke records, and that the press is lying about it via deceptively edited photos and numbers that can t possibly exist. Sean Spicer claimed that Trump s inaugural audience was the biggest in history, period, while Trump himself said he could see maybe 1.5 million people out there. Then Spicer tried to spin it to sound like he was talking about all viewers   the live crowds, television audience, and people who streamed it online.Oh, well, when you put it that way, we suppose it s possible Trump s inauguration was the most-watched in history.Or is it?It s not.The actual numbers don t support any version of their insistence that Trump s numbers broke records. The Washington Post did an analysis of inaugural numbers, past and present, and found that Trump doesn t even rank in the top three.In fact, he s in fifth place in modern history when you count the television audience. He s behind Obama in 2009, Nixon in 1973, Carter in 1977 and Reagan in 1981. In fact, Reagan s  81 inauguration at 41.8 million is where the record is, and where it will remain. Trump s 33.5 million total misses that by a hefty factor:Chart via the Washington PostAmazingly enough, Spicer does have one fairly accurate number   the 16.9 million people who he says streamed the inauguration. He s using it in a very deceptive way, though. That number is how many started streaming, but then switched to something else or turned it off entirely. The number of people who started streaming and stayed put was just 2.3 million at the time Trump took his oath of office.He s still behind Reagan and Obama, and also behind Carter s 34.1 million.And he misses Obama s numbers by a whopping 6 million. Obama had over 30 million presumable streaming starts for his inauguration that year. Even if all 30 million turned it off (they didn t), Obama still comes out ahead.The Post report also mentions that Trump s audience is older than Obama s audience was, so it s not nearly as likely that more of his remote viewers streamed it online rather than watched it on TV.It doesn t matter how you slice it; Trump s numbers were nothing special.Featured image by Kevin Dietsch via Getty Images",Fake
" Sean Hannity Disrespects Family Of Slain DNC Staffer In Sorry Quest To Prove No Trump/Russia Link Conspiracy-loving conservatives are once again all over last summer s murder of Seth Rich, a DNC staffer they believe leaked the DNC s emails to Wikileaks rather than Russia. They re yelling about it as loudly as they can because if it were true, then it would serve to demonstrate that there s no connection between Trump s campaign and Russia. This latest round of frothing over Rich s death began when Rod Wheeler, a legal commentator at Fox News, claimed he could confirm that Rich leaked those emails during an appearance Fox 5 D.C. Now Rich s family is demanding that Wheeler stop altogether, which should make others shut up too out of simple respect for them. But some don t seem to care.Rich s family sent a cease-and-desist letter to Wheeler, threatening legal action if he continued to spew his conspiracy theories about Rich s death. It seems, though, that Sean Hannity is either unaware of the family s wishes, or he just plain doesn t care. Chances are, it s the latter, since he wants to continue telling himself that Trump is his lord and savior and perfect in every way. He tweeted:Seth Rich was murdered last year in what officials believe was a botched robbery. Hannity has been screaming about it on Twitter ever since Wheeler claimed to  know  stuff on television, ignoring key facts and statements about the case is his desperation to prove that there was zero collusion between Trump s campaign and Russia.Rich s family blasted Wheeler for his statements, as well they should. A sudden death in any family is exceptionally traumatic. They said: Your statements and actions have caused, and continue to cause, the Family severe mental anguish and emotional distress. Your behavior appears to have been deliberate, intentional, outrageous, and in patent disregard of the Agreement and the obvious damage and suffering it would cause the Family Your improper and unauthorized statements, many of which are false and have no basis in fact, have also injured the memory and reputation of Seth Rich and have defamed and injured the reputation and standing of the members of the Family. Hannity should be castigated for his insistence on pushing this conspiracy theory to his not insignificant Twitter audience, as should Newt Gingrich and the Fox News network for pushing it on the air. This story has repeatedly been debunked, and the family wants everyone to shut it and let Rich rest in peace.If the story were true, it might be easier to understand why the media wouldn t leave it alone against Rich s family s wishes. But it s a vapid conspiracy that right-wingers like Hannity are pushing in a pathetic, desperate attempt to deflect attention away from the Trump-Russia connection.Featured image by Paul Zimmerman via Getty Images",Fake
" Transition Official Stuns MSNBC Anchor When He Says Not To Take Trump â€˜Literallyâ€™ (VIDEO) Every single time Donald Trump makes an absurd statement, his supporters rush in to explain what the president-elect really meant. This country will be led by a man who doesn t know how to communicate. According to a member of the transition team, Trump should be taken symbolically, not literally. Well, that s just great.MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle pressed aide Anthony Scaramucci on why Trump hasn t held a news conference since July 27th and the president-elect canceled one scheduled for December 15th.Scaramucci suggested that Trump canceled the news conference because  he s a very precise, very detail-oriented guy  who wants to have  all of the answers to all of the types of questions that s he s gonna get thrown,  according to Politico. Hold on. If he s a detail-oriented guy, then how does this statement that we ve been hearing for months   don t take him literally, take him seriously   make sense?  Ruhle asked.  Because that s sort of the opposite. Then Scaramucci blamed the media. You should definitely take him seriously because he s a man of his word, but I do think that some of the things that happens with the media is when he s sending out tweets or he s speaking in a certain way that sets the hair on fire of the nation s media   particularly the left-leaning media   I think his supporters see that more as symbolism and a rejection of sort of that egg and tomato throwing that he s experienced from June of 2015 when he announced his campaign,  he said.Scaramucci said  some people out there that do get a little crazy with the president-elect.  Well, if he d stop putting terrifying creatures in that swamp, maybe people would calm down a little. Just a suggestion.Ruhle shot back saying that Trump puts information out there but doesn t answer questions.Trump is  the most scrutinized person in the world,  Scaramucci said.  And so [as] a result of which, when that press conference comes, my guess is he s gonna have nine and 10 derivative-like questions, and he just wants to be ready for it. And that s why he delayed it, which I think is a sign of his great temperament and very good judgment. Watch: If that were true, Trump would be able to refrain from attacking people on Twitter. That does not display a  great temperament  or  good judgement.  His own aide is suggesting that Trump isn t prepared for the job. And if we take Trump  symbolically,  that kind of sucks, too. He s the hero of every white supremacist group across the board.Image via screen capture. ",Fake
"Trump to make decision on Paris climate pact after G7 summit WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will not make a decision on whether to pull the United States out of the Paris climate agreement until after he returns from the May 26-27 Group of Seven summit, the White House said Tuesday. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Trump is continuing to hear from advisers on the pros and cons of the United States remaining in the global accord. He will make a decision when he returns from the G7 summit in Italy, not prior to that, as originally planned.   â€œItâ€™s a sign that the president wants to continue to meet with his team ... and come to a decision on whatâ€™s (in) the best interest of the United States,â€ Spicer told reporters.

" BREAKING: Melania Trumpâ€™s Immigration Records Made Public, Show Trumpâ€™s ULTIMATE Hypocrisy GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump has taken a ridiculously hardline   and even bigoted   stance on immigration. He has promised to build a wall and force Mexico to pay for it, and he has said that he will erect  deportation forces  to root out and get rid of all people in the United States without proper documentation. Well, as we already knew, it turns out that The Donald is the ultimate hypocrite on this one.According to the Associated Press, it turns out that Donald Trump s wife Melania violated immigration laws by working illegally in the United States when she first arrived from her native Slovenia. Melania often modeled using just her first name, and was first granted entry into the country on a visitor s visa, known as a B1/B2 visa. This occurred on August 27, 1996. Melania did not get a legal work visa until October 18, 1996. During the time when she was prohibited from working in the country, Melania made money on ten different modeling assignments, totaling upwards of $20,000. She got a green card in 2000, and became a naturalized citizen in 2006.So, in other words, Melania Trump lied about her immigration story, as recently as Thursday, when she once again touted how a million percent legal immigration is the only way to go, and that this is how she did it. Melania said, in part, in her stump speech: As a young entrepreneur, I wanted to follow my dream to a place where freedom and opportunity were in abundance. So of course, I came here. Living and working in America was a true blessing, but I wanted something more. I wanted to be an American. Well, it appears that, as has long been suspected, that Melania Trump wasn t as kosher in her immigration and work practices as she claims. The information obtained by the AP include, but are not limited to, her contract from Metropolitan International Management   a modeling agency. Also, there s the ledgers from the agency, which is no longer in business, that shows Melania working during the time when she had the visitor s visa, but no work visa. It seems to be a complicated story full of many attempts to cover up Melania s wrongdoing, but it is certainly quite interesting. This would be why Melania Trump never released actual records regarding her initial immigration to the United States and her eventual path to citizenship. While it is unlikely that her citizenship is at risk, it certainly means that she committed immigration fraud. You can read more here at the Associated Press.The long and short of it is this: Donald Trump launched his crazy bid for the presidency preying on the fears of the  other.  Namely, immigrants. That is the height of hypocrisy, seeing as how his own wife didn t completely comply with immigration law. Hopefully this story, and the many other lies and cover-ups and shady dealings surrounding the Trump campaign break through the hypnotism that the demagogue has spun onto so many desperate citizens of this great country, and they figure out that they are falling for the biggest con of all time.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",Fake

"Comey to be pressed on whether Trump interfered with Russia probe WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former FBI Director James Comey will be grilled on whether President Donald Trump tried to get him to back off an investigation into alleged ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, key U.S. senators said on Sunday ahead of Comeyâ€™s testimony this week on Capitol Hill. Comey, who was leading the Federal Bureau of Investigationâ€™s probe into alleged Russian meddling in last yearâ€™s U.S. presidential election, was fired by Trump last month, four years into his 10-year term. The move sparked accusations that Trump dismissed Comey to hinder that investigation and stifle questions about possible collusion between his campaign and Russia. â€œI want to know what kind of pressure - appropriate, inappropriate - how many conversations he had with the president about this topic?â€ Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told CBSâ€™s â€œFace the Nationâ€ program on Sunday. The former FBI chief is due to testify on Thursday before the intelligence committee as part of its own Russia-related investigation. After Comeyâ€™s dismissal, news reports emerged that Trump asked Comey to end the probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynn during a February meeting in the Oval Office, the day after Flynn was fired for misrepresenting his contacts with the Russian ambassador. The account, first reported by the New York Times, was based on a memo Comey wrote after the meeting. The Comey memo caused alarm on Capitol Hill and raised questions about whether Trump tried to interfere with a federal investigation. â€œIt would be unthinkable if the president actually did what was reported, asked FBI Director Comey to, in effect, back off of at least the investigation into General Flynn,â€ Warner said. The potential for explosive testimony from Comey that could impact a sitting president makes Thursdayâ€™s hearing a highly anticipated event, akin to the hearings in the 1970s examining the Watergate scandal, said Linda Peek-Schacht, a political adviser who worked in President Jimmy Carterâ€™s White House. â€œThere are only a few times when Americans come together to watch one thing,â€ said Peek-Schacht, founder of a civics institute at Lipscomb University in Tennessee. â€œAmericans will be watching this.â€ U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in January that Moscow tried to sway the November vote in Trumpâ€™s favor. Russia has denied involvement, and Trump has denied any collusion between his campaign and Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin said in an interview that  he does not have any relationship with Flynn and only spoke briefly with Flynn when he sat next to him at a 2015 dinner for Russian TV network RT. â€œI made my speech. Then we talked about some other stuff. And I got up and left,â€ Putin told NBC Newsâ€™ â€œSunday Night with Megyn Kellyâ€ program. â€œThatâ€™s it. I didnâ€™t even really talk to him. Thatâ€™s the extent of my acquaintance with Mr. Flynn.â€  Republican Senator Susan Collins, who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said she is eager to question Comey to find out more about Trumpâ€™s allegation that Comey told him on three separate occasions that he was not under investigation. â€œWe need to hear directly from Mr. Comey on these important issues,â€ Collins told â€œFace the Nation.â€  â€œThe tone, the exact words that were spoken and the context are so important and thatâ€™s what we lack right now and we can only get that by talking to those directly involved,â€ she said. Trump has called the investigation into alleged ties between his campaign and Russia a â€œwitch huntâ€ designed to undermine the legitimacy of his electoral win. After reports that Trump asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein hired former FBI chief Robert Mueller as special counsel to lead the FBIâ€™s Russia probe.

"'Dreamer' issue adds to packed U.S. congressional agenda WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress, back from vacation on Tuesday, already had its plate full with urgent fiscal and disaster relief issues when President Donald Trump saddled it with deciding the fate of people brought illegally to the United States as children. The future of almost 800,000 young â€œDreamers,â€ protected from deportation by the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, now rests with lawmakers who have failed repeatedly to deal effectively with immigration issues. Trump on Tuesday scrapped DACA while giving Congress six months to do something about it. Republican Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona said permanent legislation to fix the immigration system had been Congressâ€™ prerogative all along, and that lawmakers should and could act quickly. â€œThereâ€™s a program, kids are protected by it, they are going to lose that protection if we donâ€™t act,â€ Flake said. Other critical issues are bearing down on lawmakers. Leading U.S. lawmakers said on Tuesday they were preparing to swiftly approve disaster relief for victims of Hurricane Harvey and two other must-pass priorities: preventing a default on U.S. government debt and avoiding a government shutdown. The House of Representatives was scheduled to consider on Wednesday a first installment of aid for Harvey relief and recovery, about $8 billion, and the Senateâ€™s leadership promised swift action once the House has passed the measure. Senators will then move on to making sure government creditors are paid and avoiding a government shutdown, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told the chamber, outlining the agenda for September. â€œWe have to get all three of these things done and we have to do it very quickly.â€ Republican conservatives were concerned that the various urgent items would be packaged together and rushed through in a way that would prevent lawmakers from attaching conditions that could restrain or even reform government spending. Representative Mark Walker, leader of a large group of House conservatives, said in an interview with Fox News: â€œFor Republicans, we have to be willing to hold the line when it comes to the out-of-control spending.â€ The Senateâ€™s No. 2 Republican, John Cornyn, said Republican leaders were preparing to attach a measure raising the U.S. debt ceiling - unpopular with conservatives - to the Harvey aid package when it arrives in the Senate, The Hill reported. Such a combined measure would then have to be sent back to the House for approval. â€œItâ€™s imperative that we get that (Harvey aid) supplemental passed. And the leader has made the decision to attach the debt limit to that, and I support that,â€ Cornyn told a group of reporters, according to The Hill. The Trump administration has urged that the two measures be combined. The debt ceiling caps how much money the U.S. government can borrow, and many conservatives in Congress are loath to raise it without spending reforms. Representative Mark Meadows, chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, acknowledged on Tuesday evening that conservatives probably did not have the votes to stop a measure combining Harvey aid with a debt ceiling hike. â€œIt will probably pass, with a majority of Democrats and enough Republicans to get it across the finish line,â€ Meadows said after a meeting of the caucus. Nonetheless, he said the caucus would propose that a requirement capping government spending as a percentage of gross domestic product be attached to the debt ceiling hike. Congress must raise the debt ceiling by early October to stave off an unprecedented U.S. government debt default, which would shake global markets. Lawmakers also need to approve by late September a government funding bill or the government will have to close on Oct. 1. ",Real

" Fmr. Mexican President: Trump Is Not Welcome In Our Country (VIDEO) Donald Trump has decided to make his way down to Mexico on Wednesday for a meeting with President Enrique Pena Nieto. For obvious reasons, this is a visit that is not being well received by the Mexican people. Trump s long history of insulting Mexico, its people, and Mexican immigrants in America has their community incensed at his nerve to show his face in Mexico City. Therefore, former Mexican President Vicente Fox has decided to weigh in on the situation.Appearing on CNN, Fox said: I m sure he s going to be rejected by everybody here in Mexico. We cannot accept this going on. And yes, it could be a desperate move.   To me, it is a desperate move on both sides. Fox went on to say that Trump  is not welcome to Mexico,  and continued: We don t like him. We don t want him. Fox also criticized current President Pena Nieto for entertaining Trump s visit: I think President Pena is taking an enormous political risk by hosting Trump,  going on to call Pena Nieto s decision a  big mistake.  Fox also straight   out apologized for the visit and the president s insistence on going along with it: I really apologize for our president taking this step forward. After that, Fox turned his attentions to Trump himself, and his many hypocrisies regarding the issues of immigration and trade: How can you believe him when we are hearing right now that he and his wife violated migration laws in the United States?How can he speak about trade war when he s manufacturing all his products for his business outside of the United States? It s absolutely incongruent, absolutely inconsistent. Fox then appealed directly to Americans, warning us of Trump s incompetence when it comes to being president: I just cannot envision him sitting on that chair that was the chair of President Washington, President Jefferson, President Kennedy, President Reagan   all the great presidents that nation has had.This guy is not up to be a president. Of course, Trump, unwilling to let any criticism go, actually tried to lie regarding a proposed visit with Vicente Fox. He lashed out at Fox on Twitter:Former President Vicente Fox, who is railing against my visit to Mexico today, also invited me when he apologized for using the ""f bomb.""  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 31, 2016Fox fired back, though, setting the record straight:@realDonaldTrump, I invited you to come and apologize to all Mexicans. Stop lying! Mexico is not yours to play with, show some respect.  Vicente Fox Quesada (@VicenteFoxQue) August 31, 2016Fox is likely right. The Mexican people  have every reason to loathe Donald Trump. Trump, in all his arrogance, likely thinks that this visit with President Pena Nieto will mean concessions   and, dare I say it   a check for his border wall. None of that will happen, though, and hopefully Trump returns from Mexico humiliated, as he so richly deserves.Watch video of Fox s comments below:Featured image via Patrick T. Fallon/Getty ",Fake
"U.S. energy head: Nuclear power rescue helps national security WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. energy secretary defended his plan to reward nuclear plants with incentives against criticism it would manipulate markets by telling a congressional hearing on Thursday that a strong domestic nuclear industry boosted national security.  Rick Perry pushed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Sept. 29 to issue a rule within 60 days that would reward aging nuclear and coal-fired power plants that store 90 days of fuel on site. He has said those plants should be supported for their ability to boost the reliability of the U.S. power grid.  Many U.S. representatives at the hearing, including Democrat Frank Pallone, said the plan favored aging industries, killed free markets and would saddle consumers with higher power bills. One lawmaker pointed to a study by ICF Consulting that said power bills could rise $800 million to $3.2 billion annually if FERC issued Perryâ€™s plan.   But Perry said the federal government had disregarded nuclear power for decades at a risk to national security. â€œIf we lose our supply chain, if we lose our intellectual chain of supply of bright scientists because we basically pushed the nuclear industry back, then weâ€™re going to lose our role as a leader when it comes to nuclear energy in the world,â€ Perry said. That in turn could hurt the countryâ€™s ability to address nuclear nonproliferation, Perry said.  The United States has more nuclear power reactors than any other country. But Russia, China and other countries are rapidly building nuclear plants and some in the industry worry those countries could become the worldâ€™s top nuclear innovators.  Perryâ€™s plan has divided the energy industry, with coal and nuclear interests squaring off against natural gas drillers, solar and wind power, and consumer groups. It is unclear what FERC will decide on the plan. The agency, an independent arm of the Energy Department, declined a request to lengthen a comment period on Perryâ€™s plan.   Republican Representative Pete Olson suggested that Perry was more in favor of free energy markets when he was governor of Texas. But Perry said the notion that energy markets were free and without subsidies was a â€œfallacy.â€ Pallone said a study that Perry had directed Energy Department staff to conduct concluded the grid was already reliable and that most recent grid outages were caused by problems in energy transmission, not by power plants. Several coal plants were forced to shut by recent hurricanes because their mounds of coal supply were soaked by heavy rains.   Perry said his plan was a directive for FERC, but he added that he initiated it to start a conversation about protecting people from outages during extreme storms.  ",Real
" GOP Rep Blames Media For Trumpâ€™s Attacks On Sessions On Thursday, GOP Rep. Dave Brat took to CNN to blame, of all people, the media for Donald Trump s relentless attacks on Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Brat represents Virginia s 7th District, which may explain his love of both Sessions and Trump, and his desire to blame someone else for their falling out. The 7th District was created in 1993 by decree of the Department of Justice, who forced the state to create at least one  majority minority  district in order to comply with Section 5 of the Civil Rights Act. Much of the urban areas of Richmond were carved out into a new 3rd District, and what was left   the mainly white voters   were left in the 7th.Being as Trump and Sessions are now the two most powerful racists in America, it stands to reason that a guy representing an area that hasn t voted for a single Democrat in more than 45 years   and never elected a person of color  would want them to get along.In a statement released by Brat s office on Wednesday, he decried the  full-throated obsession over Russia  by the media, which he said could not have been foreseen at the time of Sessions  recusal from the investigation. That recusal has been the source of the recent enmity between the AG and the president. From the statement:The media s attacks have only escalated since Trump s inauguration. Fake news dominates. Anchors now make the news by opinion, instead of reporting objective reality. The President is frustrated with those who have called for his impeachment since day one.But CNN s Kate Bolduan took Brat to task for seemingly blaming the press for Trump s social media outburts. In a testy exchange, she maintained a difficult smile as she said  the media s not forcing the president to tweet his attacks.  Brat s response?  I think you did.  Bolduan was incredulous:Are you kidding me?

"Despite healthcare setback, Trump says big surprise on bill could come WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Despite a major setback in the U.S. Senate, President Trump said on Wednesday that the Republican healthcare bill was moving along well and predicted a â€œsurpriseâ€ was yet to come. In a big hit to a seven-year quest to undo Democratic former President Barack Obamaâ€™s signature legislative achievement, U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday abandoned plans to get the bill passed this week. Trump, who met with Republican senators on Tuesday, made his optimistic comments to reporters at the White House on Wednesday while meeting with players from the World Series-winning Chicago Cubs. â€œWeâ€™re going to have a great, great surprise,â€ he said. Trump later said he did not think U.S. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer was serious when asking for a meeting for all 100 U.S. senators to negotiate healthcare changes. â€œI donâ€™t think heâ€™s serious. He hasnâ€™t been serious. Obamacare is such a disaster. And he wants to try and save something thatâ€™s hurting a lot of people,â€ Trump said. Trump promised as a presidential candidate to do away with Obamaâ€™s Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Republicans would like to make progress on that issue to clear the way for other priorities such as tax reform. ",Real
" Obama Puts Trump In His Place, DESTROYS Him With This One Statement During Farewell Address (VIDEO) President Barack Obama gave an amazing farewell address last night as he captivated Americans across the country and said goodbye to his time as President of the United States. At a time when many of us were feeling heartbroken and depressed that this great leader would now be followed by an underserving former reality television star, Obama made sure to leave us with a message of hope and reminded us of what we re fighting for. It was a beautiful speech, and it highlighted everything we are going to miss about him.One of the more notable parts of the speech was an epic burn Obama delivered, aimed right at President-elect Donald Trump. While Obama never once said Trump s name, it was blatantly obvious who he was talking about as he spoke about the need for diverse groups of workers to unite and stand together. Slamming Trump s divisive rhetoric and policies, Obama reached out to workers of all ages, races, genders, and professions when he said: But we re not where we need to be. All of us have more work to do. After all, if every economic issue is framed as a struggle between a hardworking white middle class and undeserving minorities, then workers of all shades will be left fighting for scraps while the wealthy withdraw further into their private enclaves. If we decline to invest in the children of immigrants, just because they don t look like us, we diminish the prospects of our own children   because those brown kids will represent a larger share of America s workforce. And our economy doesn t have to be a zero-sum game. Last year, incomes rose for all races, all age groups, for men and for women. Beautifully said. While Trump may have won the election by dividing Americans and speaking only to white workers in certain professions, Americans can stop him from dividing us further by standing together. Aside from preventing Trump from creating more division, united workers must also defy him by standing up to his greedy pro-corporation agenda which will only benefit the wealthiest.Obama knew that he had to inspire Americans enough to get them through the next four years under the worst administration they ve ever been faced with. He succeeded once again.You can watch Obama a full farewell address below, starting at around the 17 minute mark:Featured image via Darren Hauck / Getty Images",Fake
"Factbox: A report card on Donald Trump's first 100 days (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump took office on Jan. 20 with a long list of promises for his first 100 days. His record has been mixed. Here are the main issues he has confronted and what he has achieved ahead of Saturdayâ€™s 100th day.  A pledge to repeal and replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obamaâ€™s signature domestic policy, was among Trumpâ€™s central 2016 election campaign promises. It is also one of the biggest failures of his first 100 days.  A bill in the House of Representatives was withdrawn in late March when Republicans could not muster enough votes for passage even though they control the chamber.  A reworked plan this week has drawn support from the House Freedom Caucus, the conservative bloc that helped sink the original bill. That improves the chances of a deal in the House though it is unclear if it can win enough support from moderate Republicans, and it would face tougher challenges in the Senate.   Trump repeatedly promised the biggest tax reform since the 1980s. This week he proposed legislation to slash the corporate tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent, cut the top personal income tax rate to 35 percent, repeal the inheritance tax, and temporarily slash the rate on overseas profits repatriated to the United States. The plan, however, is vague and even senior Republican lawmakers described it as offering only â€œguidepostsâ€ for legislative changes.  Trumpâ€™s foreign policy has been marked by major shifts. Russia: Trump spoke admiringly of Russian President Vladimir Putin during the campaign and indicated he wanted a rapprochement with Moscow. But the administration has not been able to fend off a controversy that has led to a congressional investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, including possible links between Trumpâ€™s campaign and Moscow. TrumpÂ has cooled considerably toward Putin. Putin condemned Trumpâ€™s decision in early April to launch cruise missile strikes on Syria in punishment for a chemical weapons attack by the Syrian government, and Trump said the relationship with Russia â€œmay be at an all-time low.â€  North Korea: A growing nuclear and missile threat from North Korea is perhaps Trumpâ€™s most serious security challenge. He has vowed to prevent North Korea from being able to hit the United States with a nuclear missile, a capability experts say Pyongyang could have some time after 2020. Trumpâ€™s administration aims to push North Korea into dismantling its nuclear and missile programs through tougher international sanctions and diplomatic pressure. He has pressed China, North Koreaâ€™s biggest trading partner, to do more to curb Pyongyangâ€™s nuclear program.  NATO: Trump alarmed U.S. allies during the election campaign by calling NATO â€œobsolete.â€ In mid-April he lavished praise on NATO and said it is not obsolete.  Syria: Trump had vowed to avoid entanglements in Middle East conflicts and, in his first days in office, said he did not want the United States dragged deeper into the Syrian conflict. But he responded to the chemical weapons attack, which killed dozens of people, by ordering strikes on a Syrian air base. That won praise from allies in Europe and from U.S. lawmakers.  Trump promised a crackdown on illegal immigrants entering the United States and the deportation of illegal immigrants living in the country, especially those with criminal records. He also pledged to build a wall along the border and to get Mexico to pay for it.  The approach and strong rhetoric have had an effect with the number of migrants caught trying to enter the country illegally hitting a 17-year low in March. The number of children traveling with a guardian and apprehended at the southern U.S. border plunged by more than 90 percent in March from December. Trump insists he will build the border wall, but in order to lift the threat of a government shutdown, he gave way on his demand this week that Congress include full funding for it in a spending bill.  Trump campaigned on a promise to bar the entry of Muslims into the United States, casting it as part of the fight against the Islamic State militant group. On Jan. 27, he ordered a temporary ban on the entry of nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Syria. He also indefinitely banned refugees from Syria and temporarily banned refugees from all other countries. A federal judge temporarily halted the ban, and a federal appeals court upheld that ruling. Trump issued a revised travel ban in early March, only to see it again blocked in federal court. Similarly, a federal judge this week blocked his order to withhold federal funding from so-called sanctuary cities, which offer safe harbor to illegal immigrants.  This is one of Trumpâ€™s clearest wins. His promise to select a like-minded successor to Justice Antonin Scalia, who died early last year, was kept with the nomination of Neil Gorsuch. The Senate confirmed Gorsuch despite Democratic opposition, restoring a conservative majority on the court.  Trump withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal just days after his inauguration, keeping a campaign promise. Trump had both threatened to withdraw from or renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), blaming it for an exodus of U.S. jobs to Mexico. The threats of withdrawal had jolted financial markets at various times. On Thursday, Trump extended an olive branch, saying he would not terminate NAFTA after the leaders of Mexico and Canada asked him to work on a new trade deal. Â  Trump also ordered a review of the causes of U.S. trade deficits, such as dumping of products below cost; unfair subsidies; â€œmisalignedâ€ currencies; and â€œnon-reciprocalâ€ trade practices.  Trump had vowed to name China a currency manipulator, meaning the United States could then impose tariffs on Chinese goods. But in mid-April he changed course and said that China was not a currency manipulator. Trump has acted aggressively on his promise to eliminate regulations that he said were hurting the U.S. economy. He issued a permit for the controversial Keystone XL pipeline. He also rescinded Obama-era climate change regulations, including the Clean Power Plan; a ban on coal leasing on federal lands; and rules to curb methane emissions from oil and gas production.  As part of a push to open up more federal lands to drilling, mining and other development, Trump ordered a review to identify national monuments that can be rescinded or resized. Legal challenges are expected.  His administration has approved a dozen measures rolling back regulations passed in the final months of the Obama administration on the environment, energy, education and financial services. Trump has pledged to keep U.S. companies from shipping jobs overseas. Before taking office, Trump used the muscle of his election victory to threaten companies about moving jobs abroad. He claimed victories with the Carrier unit of United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) and with Ford Motor Co (F.N), though Carrier still cut hundreds of jobs in Indiana and Ford said it scrapped plans for a Mexican factory because of declining demand for small cars in North America. The jury is still out on how successful he can be in keeping jobs from going overseas. Trump ordered a review of the H-1B visa program, which brings highly skilled foreign workers into the United States. He says he wants to modify or replace the current lottery system with a merit-based system for highly skilled workers.  This was one of Trumpâ€™s rallying cries during the campaign, saying he would change Washington by cracking down on the influence of special interests and political elites. He criticized Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton for her paid speeches to Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs but has named several former Goldman executives to his inner circle. He did ban appointees of any executive agency from lobbying for five years after leaving government employment and permanently banned future former appointees from activity on behalf of any government or political party abroad.

"Trump says he recalls little about meeting where aide spoke of Russia WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Friday he did not remember much about a meeting last year with a former campaign aide who pleaded guilty last month as part of a federal probe into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. Asked about a meeting in which aide George Papadopoulos  suggested arranging a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump told reporters: â€œI donâ€™t remember much about that meeting. It was a very unimportant meeting.â€ According to court documents filed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, Papadopoulos said at the meeting of foreign policy advisers in March 2016 â€œthat he had connections that could help arrange a meeting between then-candidate Trump and President Putin.â€  A photograph posted on Trumpâ€™s Instagram account shows Papadopoulos sitting at the same table with Trump as well as  Jeff Sessions, now Trumpâ€™s attorney general, and several others. Papadopoulos has pleaded guilty to lying to Federal Bureau of Investigation agents about contacts with people who claimed to have ties to top Russian officials, in the first criminal charges alleging links between the Trump campaign and Moscow. His plea was made public this week.        Sessions is under pressure from Senate Democrats to testify again about the Trump campaignâ€™s Russia contacts. In testimony to the Senate Judiciary committee, Sessions has denied knowing anything about contacts between the campaign and Russians or Russian government intermediaries. The president spoke before leaving for a trip to Asia, where his domestic woes are expected to dog him. Trump denies any collusion with Russia and Moscow denies interfering in the 2016 election. Sessions is also under pressure from his boss, who has made clear he thinks the Department of Justice should look into his former presidential rival, Hillary Clinton, and her campaignâ€™s behavior with the Democratic National Committee during the presidential primary race.  Trump told reporters on Friday that many people were unhappy with the Department of Justice, including him. Those comments followed remarks he made during â€œThe Larry Oâ€™Connor Showâ€ on WMAL radio in which he lamented not having more say in the departmentâ€™s work. â€œThe saddest thing is, because I am the president of the United States, I am not supposed to be involved with the Justice Department. Iâ€™m not supposed to be involved with the FBI. Iâ€™m not supposed to be doing the kind of things I would love to be doing. And I am very frustrated by that,â€ he said. Trump on Friday repeated his urgings that the Justice Department and FBI investigate Clinton. â€œEverybody is asking why the Justice Department (and FBI) isnâ€™t looking into all of the dishonesty going on with Crooked Hillary & the Dems,â€ he said on Twitter. His comments elicited criticism from several U.S. senators. â€œPresident Trumpâ€™s pressuring of the Justice Department and FBI to pursue cases against his adversaries and calling for punishment before trials take place are totally inappropriate and not only undermine our justice system but erode the American peopleâ€™s confidence in our institutions,â€ Republican Senator Bob Corker, who has frequently sparred with Trump, said in a statement. Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said: â€œWe canâ€™t allow ourselves to become numb to the president of the United States calling on independent law enforcement organizations to investigate his political opponents. Thatâ€™s characteristic of authoritarian regimes, not democracies, and it needs to stop.â€ Trump has expressed frustration repeatedly over the Russia investigation, which has overshadowed his administration, at times referring to it as a â€œhoaxâ€ and a â€œwitch hunt.â€ Federal investigators this week charged Trumpâ€™s former campaign manager Paul Manafort and another ex-aide, Rick Gates, with money laundering and other crimes. In a court filing on Friday, Mueller estimated he would need three weeks to present his case against Manafort and Gates if it went to trial. Both men pleaded not guilty. Manafortâ€™s attorney Kevin Downing said in a filing on Friday that he would challenge what he called â€œevidence improperly obtained by search warrant, subpoena or otherwise.â€ FBI agents seized documents and other material from Manafortâ€™s Virginia home in a July raid. (This version of the story was corrected to say that Papadopoulos pleaded guilty in October, not November in paragraph one) ",Real

" Trumpâ€™s Response To Special Counsel Shows Just How Bad Things Really Are The Department of Justice announced on Wednesday that former FBI Director Robert Mueller has been named as special counsel for the investigation into Donald Trump s likely collusion with Russia. After a week that has rocked Washington to the core and left the White House in utter chaos, the statement released by Trump in response to the news that special counsel had been appointed shows just how bad things really are within the Oval Office.The statement consisted of a mere three sentences: As I have stated many times, a thorough investigation will confirm what we already know   there was no collusion between my campaign an any foreign entity. I look forward to this matter concluding quickly. In the meantime, I will never stop fighting for the people and the issues that matter most to the future of our country. The first thing that stands out about this statement is that it is distinctly un-Trumplike. And this uncharacteristically coherent statement also shows the White House is understanding the gravity of the current situation. Despite the words themselves, these three short sentences show that Trump clearly knows he is in deep sh*t.After he fired FBI Director James Comey, news broke that Trump had tried to pressure him to drop the Russia investigation and Trump s Twitter feed went silent. Something very unusual for the tweeter-in-chief. Until he released this short statement, the only remarks he had made were at a commencement speech for the U.S. Coast Guard, where he whined that he had been treated more unfairly than any other president in history. (Insert eye roll here.)At this point, pundits are speculating that Trump may have hired an outside attorney who is telling him to shut the hell up. No one really knows whether he has sought counsel or not, although he clearly should if he hasn t because he s definitely going to need it. But his statement and his silence make one thing very clear, Trump knows he s in trouble. He may want it all to just go away, but the appointment of special counsel guarantees that this  matter  will NOT be  concluding quickly.  And even Trump is smart enough to know it this time.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",Fake

There s been a lot of analysis of who s voted by party, but really no sense given of how they re voting.Really what s fueling, honestly, this somewhat surprising eight percent margin for Secretary Clinton is the fact that she s performing incredibly strongly with registered Republican voters. So, what we re seeing in this survey is winning 28% of registered Republicans who have already cast a ballot in Florida. This certainly doesn t look too good for Trump, but it s still early and the election is still a week a way, so who s really to know. BUT it s definitely looking good for Clinton thus far. Watch here:28% of GOP early voters in Florida voted for #HillaryClinton & she has an 8 point lead in early voting!#ImWithHer #LastWord pic.twitter.com/zNIk7UEyEE  Khary Penebaker (@kharyp) November 2, 2016Featured Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images",Fake

"Factbox: Republicans' Obamacare plan would dump Medicaid expansion, taxes (Reuters) - After months of internal discord, Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday were still trying to craft a bill to overhaul the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, a law they have been attacking since it was enacted in 2010. Two attempts in recent weeks to pass an overhaul bill have collapsed in confusion, with conservatives pushing for a more complete repeal and moderates keen to avoid going too far for fear of angering their constituents. Obamacare brought health insurance coverage to millions of Americans. The first version of the Republican bill, known as the American Health Care Act, or AHCA, would have left 24 million more Americans without coverage, according to an estimate by nonpartisan congressional researchers. The House has recently added two amendments to the AHCA to try to appease both conservatives and moderates. Here are the latest versions of the billâ€™s main provisions:  The Republican plan would maintain some of Obamacareâ€™s most popular provisions. It would allow young adults to stay on their parentsâ€™ health plan until age 26 and it would ban insurers from setting a lifetime dollar limit on coverage. An amendment introduced by moderate Republican Representative Tom MacArthur would let states opt out of Obamacareâ€™s mandate that insurers charge sick and healthy people the same rates. It would also allow states to opt out of Obamacareâ€™s requirement that insurers cover 10 essential health benefits, such as maternity care and mental health treatment.  The measure would provide states with $100 billion, largely to fund high-risk pools to provide insurance to the sickest patients. An amendment added Wednesday would provide another $8 billion over five years to help those with pre-existing conditions pay for health insurance. The bill would let insurers mark up premiums by 30 percent for those who have a lapse in insurance coverage of about two months or more. Insurers won another provision they had long sought: The ability to charge older Americans up to five times more than young people. Under Obamacare, they could only charge up to three times more. The Republicans want to end in 2018 Obamacareâ€™s income-based tax credits that help low-income people buy insurance. These would be replaced with age-based tax credits ranging from $2,000 to $4,000 per year that would be capped at upper-income levels. While Obamacareâ€™s credits gave more help to those with lower incomes, the Republican plan would be largely age-based. The Republican bill would abolish most Obamacare taxes, including on medical devices, health insurance premiums, indoor tanning salons, prescription medications and high-cost employer-provided insurance known as â€œCadillacâ€ plans. Those taxes paid for Obamacare. Republicans have not said how they would pay for the parts of the law they want to keep. The bill would also repeal the Obamacare financial penalty for the 2016 tax year for not purchasing insurance, as well as a surtax on investment income earned by upper-income Americans. It would repeal the mandate that larger employers must offer insurance to their employees.  Under Obamacare, more than 30 states, including about a dozen Republican states, expanded the Medicaid government health insurance program for the poor. About half of Obamacare enrollees obtained insurance through the expansion. The bill would allow the Medicaid expansion to continue until January 1, 2020, providing states chose not to expand. After that date, expansion would end and Medicaid funding would be capped on a per-person basis. State Medicaid plans would no longer have to cover some Obamacare-mandated essential health benefits, fulfilling a Republican promise to return more control to the states. ",Real
"Factbox: U.S. Justice Department's special counsel probe of Russia WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s dismissal of FBI Director James Comey has raised questions about the future of the agencyâ€™s probe into Russian attempts to sway the 2016 presidential election and possible collusion with Trumpâ€™s campaign. The Justice Department announced on May 17 that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had appointed former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Robert Mueller as a special counsel to lead an independent probe. Here is what to expect: * The FBIâ€™s investigation will continue.  Comeyâ€™s firing did not end the FBIâ€™s investigation into Moscowâ€™s role in the 2016 election. The career FBI staffers Comey put in charge of the probe will likely continue it, legal experts told Reuters, even as the White House interviews new directors. * Probes underway in the U.S. Congress will also continue. Investigations already underway in the Senate Intelligence Committee and House Intelligence Committee and other panels will progress. Congress could also create a special commission or appoint a special master separate from the committee probes even after Muellerâ€™s appointment, experts said. Senate Republicans, including some from leadership, previously argued that the appointment of a special counsel could imperil ongoing congressional probes. Mueller will not have the authority to demand Congress halt a probe. Though criminal probes can at times complicate congressional matters, legal experts said the complications would be indistinguishable from those created by the already ongoing FBI investigation. * Mueller will steer a parallel probe at the Justice Department.  Mueller will interview relevant witnesses, subpoena documents and, if the evidence merits, work with the FBI to bring criminal charges related to the probe. *Mueller will operate with a high degree of independence from the Trump administration. Rosenstein appointed Mueller to head the departmentâ€™s Russia probe citing department regulations that allow attorney generals to appoint a special counsel from outside the federal government.  The department regulations are â€œnot quite as robustâ€ as a law related to the appointment of a special prosecutor that lapsed in the 1990s, according to Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. But â€œthe regulations are designed to give the special counsel a great degree of independence - decisions can be overridden but if they are, to make sure that Congress knows about them,â€ Levitt said. Rosenstein appointed Mueller because Attorney General Jeff Sessions had to recuse himself from involvement in Russia-related probes because he had not told Congress about his own contacts with Russian officials. *It would be difficult to fire Mueller from the job. Only the attorney general - or in this case Rosenstein, as the acting attorney general in matters related to Russia - has the authority to fire a special counsel. Justice Department regulations state that a special counsel can only be removed â€œfor cause,â€ such as misconduct, conflict of interest or dereliction of duty, Levitt said. Though Rosenstein, like Comey, serves at the pleasure of the president and could be removed without cause at any time, Levitt cautioned that doing so in order to jeopardize Muellerâ€™s probe would come at a high political cost. â€œEach of those actions will come with increasing public and congressional scrutiny,â€ Levitt said.

" Ivanka Trump Shares Famous Jewish Quote, But Hilariously Credits Harry Potter Star (IMAGE) Ordinarily, it s not cool to go after a presidential candidate s family, but seeing as Ivanka Trump, daughter of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, is so active within the campaign, sorry, this is totally fair game.Ivanka, taking to both Twitter and Instagram to presumably share one of her favorite quotes with the many who follow her, posted: If not me, who? If not now, when? Which, ordinarily, is quite apropos for a person to post especially during a presidential campaign despite whether you think it s accurate or not.There s one big problem, however, she credited the quote not to its originator Hillel the Elder, an extremely important person in Jewish history, but rather to Harry Potter star Emma Watson.See more #ITwisewords: https://t.co/KzEUXBsXFb #quote #inspiration pic.twitter.com/mWFdLSxaL3  Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) September 9, 2016Watson, who is also notably a UN Women Goodwill Ambassador, used the quote in her famous speech from 2014.

"Trump withdrawal from climate deal gets mixed response from U.S. companies NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday withdrawing the country from the Paris climate accord would stave off an economic crisis and protect American jobs - but many American companies seemed to disagree. Criticism of his decision rolled in from blue-chip companies like Facebook Inc, Apple Inc , Ford Motor Co  and Microsoft Corp , while the response from fossil fuel groups with the most to gain from a relaxation of U.S. carbon emissions standards was muted.  Tesla Inc Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk and Walt Disney Co CEO Robert Iger said they would leave White House advisory councils over Trumpâ€™s decision. In an interview on Thursday, the president of the World Coal Association, Benjamin Sporton, told Reuters that he had mixed feelings about Trumpâ€™s announcement, adding he was eager to see a U.S. policy that actively promotes a place for coal in the global energy mix. â€œWhat we really need to see, if the president wants to re-enter the deal, is that he can change the agreement to recognize the role of all sources of energy, including coal,â€ Sporton said, adding his group had described to administration officials the benefits of remaining in the agreement. The American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industryâ€™s biggest trade group, meanwhile, issued a statement saying it had never taken an official position on the Paris accord.  A number of its members, including Exxon Mobil Corp and ConocoPhillips, had publicly supported the deal. â€œFor us, our position on the Paris agreement... we need a framework like that to address the risks of climate change,â€ Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods told reporters on the sidelines of the companyâ€™s annual general meeting on Wednesday. Some other groups expressed measured support for Trumpâ€™s decision, saying it provided an opportunity to fix problems with the deal. â€œManufacturers support the spirit of the Paris Agreement and the effort to address climate change through a fair international agreement. But as the president has acknowledged, certain elements of this deal were not equitable for U.S. manufacturers,â€ said Ross Eisenberg, vice president for energy and resources policy at the National Association of Manufacturers, in a statement to Reuters.  A spokesman for Peabody Energy Corp, Americaâ€™s largest publicly traded coal miner, had said on Wednesday that the company would support a decision by Trump to withdraw from the Paris deal because the â€œaccord is flawed on a number of levels.â€ Trump vowed during his campaign to pull the United States out of the Paris deal, arguing the pact would cost the United States trillions of dollars, kill jobs, and stymie economic growth without providing tangible benefit. His critics have argued, however, that the risks of climate change require action, and that a shift to a low-carbon energy economy can create more jobs than it eliminates. Spokespeople for other extractive oil and mining groups, like the National Mining Association and the American Fuel & Petrochemicals Manufacturers, declined to comment on Trumpâ€™s decision to withdraw from the Paris accord. But a number of other business leaders derided it in forceful terms. â€œTodayâ€™s decision is a setback for the environment and for the U.S.â€™s leadership position in the world,â€ said Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein in his first-ever tweet.  â€œDisappointed with todayâ€™s decision on the Paris Agreement. Climate change is real. Industry must now lead and not depend on government,â€ tweeted General Electric Coâ€™s Jeff Immelt. Appleâ€™s CEO Tim Cook, meanwhile, posted to Twitter: â€œDecision to withdraw from the #ParisAgreeement was wrong for our planetâ€ and â€œApple is committed to fight climate change and we will never waverâ€. â€œWithdrawing from the Paris climate agreement is bad for the environment, bad for the economy, and it puts our childrenâ€™s future at risk,â€ wrote Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a Facebook post.

Since then, conservatives have suddenly become the arbiter of political correctness and they suddenly give a crap about gay people, well, they care that their beloved leader had a sex joke made about him, which somehow makes Colbert homophobic. #FireColbert immediately became a trending hashtag on Twitter.I am a conservative who respects free speech.

" White House Officials Caught Openly Mocking Trump, Administration In Free Fall (DETAILS) Donald Trump s behavior and outlandish ways have made him countless enemies   and some of them are in the White House. Apparently, there s a lot of animosity over the fact that Trump s team keeps trying to do damage control and save Trump from the several federal investigations that are haunting the White House, and Trump continues to undo their hard work every day.This couldn t be more clear in the way the White House has reacted to Trump s lashing out at his own Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein, on Friday morning. The Daily Beast is reporting that Trump s team is so disgusted by this, Trump s aides and advisers are actually mocking him and making jokes about how they can get him to shut the hell up.In response to Trump s tweet about Rosenstein this morning, in which Trump said I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director! , an anonymous  senior Trump administration official  reportedly joked: Has anyone read his Miranda rights? At this point in Trump s flawed presidency, we all know that the best thing he could do for himself and his numerous criminal investigations would be to remain silent   which he is incapable of. One senior Trump administration official even placed blame on Trump for bringing the obstruction of justice inquiry upon himself. That senior aide said: The president did this to himself. Another White House official shared that no one in the administration is surprised when Trump goes off the rails on Twitter anymore. That official said that for  all the heartburn and misery , they should expect that dealing with Trump s insanity is just part of the job now: If you haven t made this a settled factor in your morning routine, why are you still here? Thanks to Trump s erratic behavior, GOP insiders are seriously worried that he s not mentally fit to continue on with the rest of his presidency. Republican strategist Evan Siegfried said: President Trump has started the clock on the Rosenstein firing watch. This is feeding the private discussions in the GOP about the president s state of mind. As Trump s erratic behavior gets worse, we can expect more White House and GOP leaks as Trump s team turns on him one by one.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images",Fake
" Michael Moore LAYS WASTE To Anyone Who Says They Are â€˜Christianâ€™ Yet Supports Trumpâ€™s Bigotry If you claim to be a  Christian  but support Donald Trump and all the hate and bigotry he embodies, you re a hypocrite.And that s exactly what Michael Moore told Joy Reid during her Saturday morning show on MSNBC.Ever since Trump won the election on Tuesday night his deplorable supporters have been terrorizing minorities and women across the country, causing fear and panic in communities to the point that a movement has begun in which people wear safety pins to signify to others that they are safe to be near.But Moore believes more has to be done, particularly by white people. White people, no matter how painful, have a responsibility to reject anybody who stands in front of a camera who spews racism. Who spews sexism, misogyny. Who brags about being a sexual predator. I don t care what your race is, but especially if you re white. Because that means that you belong to the race that s been in power forever. This a country that was founded on genocide and built on the backs of slaves. So you have a special responsibility as a white person to always object to anybody who uses racism, who spews this hatred. Moore the wondered how white Americans will feel when they wake up one morning and realize that they ve been shitty human beings because they did nothing when they had a chance to stand against the hate. And that led to Moore calling out white people who call themselves  Christian. And do not call yourself a Christian if you are not willing, literally, to put your body in front of whoever is coming to hurt the other   the people who are not you. Here s the video via Twitter.MMFlint on the special responsibility he says white people have during #DonaldTrump presidency #AMJoy https://t.co/Ih87pHq8AB  AM Joy w/Joy Reid (@amjoyshow) November 12, 2016Moore is absolutely right. Because of Trump, the responsibility falls on white people to stand up against the racism, sexism, bigotry, and hate that he has incited against any American who isn t white or Christian. So whenever we see these behaviors we need to be brave and take a stand because being silent isn t an option.Featured Image: Screenshot",Fake

"Flynn associates subpoenaed in Russia probe: CNN WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors have issued grand jury subpoenas seeking business records from people who worked with former U.S. national security adviser Michael Flynn when he was a private citizen, CNN reported on Tuesday. Citing people familiar with the matter, CNN said the subpoenas were issued by the U.S. Attorneyâ€™s Office in Alexandria, Virginia. They targeted people who worked with Flynn on contracts after he was pushed out of his job as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014, it reported. Flynn later joined the Trump campaign but was fired as the White House national security adviser by President Donald Trump in February after he failed to tell the truth about his contacts with the Russian ambassador to the United States. Flynnâ€™s attorney, Robert Kelner, did not respond immediately to a request for comment. A Justice Department spokeswoman said the department does not comment on the existence of ongoing investigations. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is looking into allegations Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election to benefit Trump, as well as possible links to the Trump campaign. Russia has repeatedly denied interfering in the U.S. election and the Trump administration denies allegations of collusion with Russia. Trump fired FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday, saying he had lost confidence in Comey over his handling of an election-year email scandal involving then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Flynn, a retired general, has emerged as a central figure in the Russian probes.  Investigators have been looking into whether Flynn properly disclosed payments from clients with links to foreign governments, including Russia and Turkey, CNN said.     ",Real

" WATCH: Scottie Nell Hughes Calls Clinton A Bigot For Speaking Out Against Racism On Sunday, Scottie Nell Hughes joined a panel discussion on CNN s Reliable Sources where the Trump campaign surrogate defended Donald Trump s characterization of his Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton as a  bigot.  The justification for the label? Clinton is prejudiced against the racist faction of Trump s base.Most of the conversation surrounded the Trump campaigns hiring of Steve Bannon as his campaign CEO. Bannon is officially on a  temporary leave  from his position as the executive chairman for the reactionary (often dubbed as the  alt-right ) right-wing media site, Breitbart. The site caters to an audience that would probably consider Fox News to be a liberal propaganda network.MTV News host, Jamil Smith said during the panel discussion that he considers Breitbart to support white supremacy and racism. I would say that [Breitbart is] part of the white supremacist machine. They are trying to make sure these views become mainstream. And I think, through Trump, they are finding a way to do that. Trump has faced waves of criticism for the move to hire Bannon from Clinton, the left, and even some members of the right. To which Trump referred to Clinton as a bigot for doing so. Here s Hughes justification for the use of the term: Bigotry, if you look at the definition, it s about someone who s small-minded and sits there and directs hate towards a certain group. Hillary Clinton s speech was all about hate towards a group that, while my fellow counterpart might consider them to be very racist, it s the exact opposite. At that point, Hughes dives hot-head first into one of her just this side of unhinged rants, claiming that just because a section of Breitbart s readers are white supremacists, doesn t mean they all are.Smith, apparently noticing that Hughes doesn t understand what he said at all clarifies his position: What they present is the view of the white supremacist mentality through their coverage. It s not necessarily saying,  Well, everyone who works there is a white supremacist.  I don t know that.  Smith continues, finalizing his thoughts,  The point is to say, what kind of viewpoint did they reflect? And it s undeniable that they reflect a white supremacist view if you looked over their coverage over the last several years. I would consider being called a bigot against white supremacists and those who promote it a badge of honor, as I m sure most people would. In the mind of a Trump campaign surrogate, that s a valid line of attack.You can watch the segment below.Featured image from video screenshot",Fake

" WATCH: Wolf Blitzer NAILS Giuliani To The Wall For Ten Grueling Minutes Over His FBI Claims Sometimes it takes a wolf to catch a snake.Rudy Giuliani has been making the media rounds over the last two days, bragging that he knew about FBI Director James Comey s letter two days before it went public.That means Giuliani has been getting inside information from the supposedly non-partisan Federal Bureau of Investigation that he has likely been passing on to Donald Trump, which means the FBI appears to be colluding with Trump s campaign to sabotage Hillary Clinton.And during an interview with Wolf Blitzer on CNN Friday night, Giuliani was cornered over it because the only way he could possibly get such information is if a current FBI agent is passing information to him personally, or through someone else. No, I ve spoken to no current FBI agents,  Giuliani claimed when asked by Blitzer.  Gosh, in the last eight months, nine months, ten months, certainly not about this. Then Giuliani claimed that everything he has been hearing is just hearsay. But that apparently has not stopped him from spewing the  hearsay  on Fox News and elsewhere in an effort to smear Hillary Clinton. So, I ve had lots of conversations with them and they have told me a lot about the   I guess the disagreement between the Justice Department on the one hand and the FBI on the other. But it all comes from former FBI agents and it s all hearsay. But that s hard to believe since Giuliani claimed that he knew about Comey s letter two days in advance and that letter was actually released. It was not hearsay.Blitzer then hit Giuliani with a statement written by Democratic congressmen accusing him of obtaining leaked information from FBI agents.The statement reads: This morning Rudy Giuliani, one of Donald Trump s closest and most vocal campaign advisers, appeared on national television and confirmed that he had obtained leaked information about the FBI s review of Clinton-related e-mails several days before FBI Director James Comey sent his letter to Congress last Friday about this letter. In fact, Mr. Giuliani went even further and bragged about the information that he had obtained stating,  Did I hear about it? You re darn right I heard about it. Again, the only way Giuliani could have heard about this is if a current FBI agent leaked the information to him or passed it to him through someone else. Either way, the FBI has a serious breach that is being used to help Donald Trump. That s not correct,  Giuliani responded.  I ve had no conversations with anyone inside the FBI. I have heard for the last four months a tremendous amount of information about the consternation within the FBI, the fact that FBI agents were very unhappy about the way they were being treated by the Justice Department. But none of it came from any current   I haven t talked to a current FBI agent. So Giuliani just admitted that he is getting this information from former agents who are getting the information from current agents.Blitzer actually got Giuliani to claim that he didn t know that Comey was going to release the information he did, and that it came as a surprise, but Giuliani did an about-face only seconds later and said it wasn t a surprise. Seriously, Blitzer did a great job of getting Giuliani to tie himself in knots.The former NYC mayor then repeated his alleged  hearsay  once again by claiming that he has heard from his sources that FBI agents are angry at the Justice Department for not indicting Hillary Clinton, despite the fact that Director Comey recommended that charges were not warranted.Giuliani then claimed that he read articles about it somewhere, but didn t specify where the articles came from and said he s not sure if they are true.So Giuliani claims that he is talking to former FBI agents, and that what he has heard is merely hearsay that he spreads anyway as if it s the truth, and then he claims that he read this information in articles even though he doesn t know if what he is reading is the truth, and he still repeats it to anyone within earshot.And Wolf Blitzer drove a stake through the heart of Giuliani s bullshit by asking one question. But let me ask you a question, Mayor. If you don t know it s true, why are you suggesting it? Why are you going on national television talking about these issues if you don t know it s true? Giuliani once again touted his FBI sources, only to then be informed by Blitzer that FBI agents sign a form agreeing to never reveal information about investigations and that they have a responsibility to not leak information to people like Giuliani.Here s the video via YouTube.[ad3media campaign= 1302 ]The FBI should be thoroughly investigated by the Justice Department to find out who is leaking information to a private citizen who also happens to be a surrogate for a presidential candidate who will do anything to smear his opponent in an effort to win the election. This is a major breach within the FBI and it definitely looks like the FBI is working with Republicans to persecute Hillary Clinton. People need to be fired for this and the first person to lose their job should be Director Comey.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",Fake
" Mitch McConnell HUMILIATES Trump, Gives Him A BRUTAL Reality Check On Border Wall (VIDEO) Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell might just find himself the next target of one of Donald Trump s temper tantrums on Twitter.Earlier today during a Politico Playbook event, McConnell basically threw Trump under the bus and humiliated him in front of everyone when he very bluntly said that Mexico would NOT be paying for Trump s idiotic, ineffective border wall   a statement that greatly contradicts everything that Trump promised during his presidential campaign.When McConnell was questioned about Trump s wall, McConnell first tried to give a diplomatic answer and said, there are some places along the border where that s probably not the best way to secure the border.  However, when he was further pressed to see if he felt Mexico would pay for the wall, McConnell dropped all niceties and put his thoughts very bluntly. He smirked and said: Uh, no. McConnell and everyone in the room then shared a laugh, all at Trump s expense.You can watch McConnell poke fun at Trump below: For a leading Republican like McConnell to embarrass the Republican Party s leader and sitting POTUS like this is certainly surprising, and it only proves just how few people actually believe Trump is competent enough for this role and will be able to deliver his promises to the American people.Already, we ve seen Trump walk back several of his major campaign promises, one of them being this Mexico border wall. Mexico s leaders have already repeatedly stated that Mexico will not pay for the wall, and Trump has had to cover it up and lie to the American people and say that first taxpayers will pay for the wall, only to be reimbursed by Mexico at a later date   which Mexico has not agreed to. McConnell s comments show that no one   not even the GOP   believes Trump anymore.Featured image via Drew Angerer / Getty Images",Fake
" Trump Surrogate: Carter Page Being A Russian Agent Isnâ€™t Evidence Of â€˜Collusionâ€™ (VIDEO) If you haven t heard, former Trump advisor Carter Page was the subject of a successfully-executed FISA warrant because of his dealings with Russia. Former FBI agent Asha Rangappa notes that the bar to obtain a warrant is extremely high and that the process of obtaining one  includes too many layers of approval to be granted without strong evidence.  Nevertheless, Trump and his associates continue to complain that members of his campaign and administration became the subject of investigations because of their illegal activity.On Tuesday, the Washington Post reported that Page became the focus of an investigation because a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court judge was thoroughly convinced that there was  probable cause to believe Page was acting as an agent of a foreign power, in this case Russia. Appearing on CNN, braindead Trump lemming Kayleigh McEnany worked hard to dispel any idea that Page colluding with Russia is evidence that members of the campaign colluding with Russia. I don t think it s evidence of the Trump campaign colluding with Russia at all,  she said.  He was a brief adviser on the campaign, and the campaign [was] trying to distance themselves from him.  In reality, Page was one of the first foreign policy advisors Trump named. But look, I don t think we have any evidence to suggest that President Trump knew that this guy was a foreign agent, and he wanted him on his campaign because he wanted to collude with Russia,  he said.  That is another step that you have to make, and I don t think there are facts there to show that. Here s the thing: whether or not Trump knew is a nonissue. When Trump was warned about Michael Flynn s shady dealing with Russia, he brushed it off and kept the disgraced General on as national security advisor. He even fired the person who warned him. It would not have mattered to Trump if he knew about Page, because for some reason it s cool to work with Russia under President* Trump.Watch the interview below:Featured image via screengrab",Fake
" Australia Prime Minister Tells Trump To Man Up And Accept Refugees Because â€˜A Dealâ€™s A Dealâ€™ The  deal-maker  just got owned.Donald Trump embarrassed himself and America again during a recent phone call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.As we all know, President Obama struck a deal with Australia in 2015 agreeing to take 2,000 refugees from Nauru and Papua New Guinea s Manus Island.But Trump doesn t want to honor the deal, so he whined about it. I hate taking these people,  Trump said.  I guarantee you they are bad. That is why they are in prison right now. They are not going to be wonderful people who go on to work for the local milk people. The refugees are in a detention camp right now because they have been denied entry into Australia. They are not necessarily  bad  people.Trump s  milk people  remark is a reference to the American dairy industry.It s a racist remark, of course. Because not all immigrants perform farm work. Some become doctors and businessmen. Some become teachers and police officers. Some even go into politics.The fact is that United States can also hold these refugees until a thorough vetting process is complete before allowing them to resettle. Therefore, Trump s concern that these refugees are  bad  is ridiculous.Anyway, Turnbull, who is also a businessman, told Trump to suck it up and honor the terms of the agreement. There is nothing more important in business or politics than a deal is a deal,  Turnbull reminded Trump.  You can certainly say that it was not a deal that you would have done, but you are going to stick with it. In other words, the man who allegedly wrote  The Art of The Deal  just got schooled on deal-making by Australia s prime minister.Turnbull is right. A deal is a deal and Trump must comply with it or risk angering and alienating one of our closest allies.Trump cannot just go back and examine every deal made in American history and go back on it if he doesn t agree with it. That s not how governing works. Sitting presidents must honor the agreements made by their predecessors. Anything else violates trust between nations and hurts our reputation around the globe.He can try to renegotiate a deal if he wishes and some deals can even be voided by Congress. But the deal with Australia will be hard to renegotiate because Turnbull expects America to honor it.And we should. It s the right thing to do.Featured Image: Mark Wilson/Getty Images",Fake
" California Single-Payer Health Care Bill Shelved And People Arenâ€™t Happy To say people aren t happy is an understatement. People are extremely angry about state Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon shelving the single-payer healthcare bill in California.Huffington Post reports that Rendon has received death threats since making this decision.It is a shame that the bill got shelved as we all wanted to see how California would fare, but nobody should be threatening another life over it. We, as people, are meant to be better than that. Especially those of us with progressive outlooks.Rendon opted to pull the bill last week despite his support for a single-payer system. He called the plan  woefully incomplete.  He urged the state Senate to  fill the holes  and send the Assembly a  workable  bill next year. Even senators who voted for SB 562 noted there are potentially fatal flaws in the bill,  he said in a statement on Friday. These include its failure to address  many serious issues, such as financing, delivery of care, cost controls, or the realities of needed action by the Trump administration and voters  to make the bill  a genuine piece of legislation,  he said.That sounds fair, does it not? If we re going to do something progressive, we need to do it as correctly as possible, not half-baked. Rendon does not sound like he s against the plan.Yet, the death threats poured in. Supporters organized protests at Rendon s district office in Los Angeles County, as well as outside the state capitol in Sacramento. Some single-payer supporters held signs depicting the California state flag s grizzly bear stabbed in the back with a knife that reads  Rendon.  Social media got ugly, as always.I get it. We re all frustrated over the current healthcare situation in America. We all wanted to see how California would do with a single-payer system. It could pave the way for other states and do amazing things for everyone. But I think we should all step back and be rational about things. Rome wasn t built in a day.You have a right to be angry, but people need to stop sending death threats when things don t work out.Featured image via ROBYN BECK/AFP/Getty Images",Fake
" POLL: Most Trump Supporters Say Fake â€˜Bowling Green Massacreâ€™ Justifies Muslim Ban Did you know that people who support Donald Trump s unconstitutional Muslim ban are idiots? This isn t just a flippant remark about them; there s evidence   like the fact that most of them think the Bowling Green Massacre, which did not happen, completely justifies Trump s executive order.A new report from Public Policy Polling found that most Americans   48 to 43 percent   view the  travel ban  as targeting Muslims , and only 22 percent of Americans support that position. In fact, the phrase  one would have to be an idiot to support the Muslim ban  is now more true than ever. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement:  the Bowling Green massacre shows why we need Donald Trump s executive order on immigration?  respondents were asked, with 57 percent disagreeing and only 23 percent backing that position.The low number of Americans who still somehow think the Bowling Green Massacre is real is positive   but when PPP looked at numbers among Trump supporters, they found that more than half view the Massacre That Didn t Happen as justification for Trump s ban:66% of Americans consider the United States to be a safe country, to only 23% who consider it unsafe. Perhaps as an outgrowth of that sentiment only 45% of voters support Trump s Executive Order on immigration, to 49% who are opposed to it. Among those who do support it you have to wonder how well thought out their position is- by a 51/23 margin Trump voters say that the Bowling Green Massacre shows why Trump s immigration policy is needed. By a 48/43 spread, voters do think that the intent of the Executive Order is to be a Muslim ban. And just 22% support a Muslim ban, to 65% who are opposed.Trump is likely sweating bullets, as the poll also reveals that almost half   48 percent of Americans   want to see him impeached. His henchmen and women are growing steadily more unpopular too. 47 percent of Americans (compared to 34 percent who like her) find Kellyanne Conway to be detestable, 41 percent (32% like him) are dissatisfied with Sean Spicer s performance. A whopping 49 percent (compared to 27 percent) don t like Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, and 72 percent hate Trump s best friend Vladimir Putin. In fact   a sign of how desperate things have gotten   more Americans (38 percent to 30 percent) say they would rather see Mike Pence as President than Trump. Hillary Clinton still wins in that regard, 49 percent to 45 percent.Even worse for Trump is the demographics of those polled. Only 39 percent of respondents identify as Democrats while 60 percent say they are Republicans or Independents, the exact groups Trump courted when he was running for President. In other words, there s no claiming that this poll was loaded with Democrats for Trump fans.Donald Trump said during the election that he loves the  poorly educated,  but he might as well have said stupid. Though Kellyanne Conway has used the Bowling Green Massacre in her scaremongering numerous time and ultimately admitted she lied about its existence, The Donald s supporters still take it as gospel. They ve gone from  alternative facts  to  alternative reality. featured image via Getty Images (Chip Somodevilla)/screengrab",Fake

" Trump SLAMS Canada By Using Example Border State; That State Doesnâ€™t Border Canada (TWEET) It can easily be said that Donald Trump doesn t have a clue what he is doing. He hears things in clips and talking points, and then spews them out to the world, usually via Twitter, without thinking about the weight of his actions.One of the things Trump has been hung up on lately is Canada taking control of their dairy. According to Business Insider: Last year, Canada implemented a policy that created a new class of milk prices for ultra-filtered milk, a liquid, high-protein concentrate sometimes used to make products such as cheese and yogurt. Canada lowered the prices for this milk class, so as to incentivize domestic ultra-filtered milk and better compete with the US-produced imports. How dare they, right? The United States should not only legislate in their own country regarding the market but also around the world. At least that s what Trump seems to think.So Trump, trying to puff his chest and seem like he s a tough guy, tweets out: Canada has made business for our dairy farmers in Wisconsin and other border states very difficult. We will not stand for this. Watch! Canada has made business for our dairy farmers in Wisconsin and other border states very difficult. We will not stand for this. Watch!  Donald J.

" Former FBI Agent: â€˜Stay Tunedâ€™ Because Mueller Is Hot On Trumpâ€™s Trail (VIDEO) Donald Trump is terrified of Special Counsel Robert Mueller. This is especially true since it has been revealed that Mueller has now impaneled a grand jury in Washington D.C. in the Russian probe. Now, according to a former FBI Agent, Trump is right to be very, very worried.Asha Rangappa is now a national security analyst for CNN. She also is the Associate Dean of Yale Law School. Before that, though, she worked for the FBI. On Saturday, she had a warning for Trump, and hopeful news for the American people. First, she talked about disgraced National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, and the Mueller team s request that the White House hand over all documents relating to Flynn s short and troubled time in the White House: They probably honed in on a crime or some set of crimes that they want to get more information on. They re probably looking for any kind of communications. Of course, this is likely related to foreign payments that Flynn received but did not immediately disclose. Then, Rangappa went on to say that the grand jury is definitely bad news for Trump and the people in his orbit: The new grand jury is an indication that this is expanding. This is probably still in the early stages. It would be normal at this point to collect more evidence, so they want possibly financial records, they want people to come in and testify under oath to get more information and they re going to use that to proceed. So this is going to be one stage of many as I explained to some people, if this were a TV drama, this might be Episode 4. So, stay tuned. There s more coming. This is getting hotter by the day, and no amount of Trump s going on unhinged Twitter rants about how the Russia story is  fake news,  a  witch hunt,  or a  hoax  will stop Robert Mueller from getting to the bottom of what happened between Team Trump and the Russians. We will be staying tuned for sure, Ms. Rangappa. You can bet on that.Watch the video below:Featured image via Ann Heisenfelt/Getty Images",Fake
"U.S. Defense Dept needs to better manage its finances: GAO WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Defense Department needs to better manage its finances if it hopes to rebuild and modernize the U.S. Armed Forces, the Government Accountability Office said in a report released on Tuesday. The Pentagon needs to give its decision makers and weapons buyers more accurate budget and cost information so they can make better decisions as they modernize weapons systems, the report said.  U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s $4.1 trillion fiscal 2018 budget proposal included $603 billion in defense spending for the Department of Defense as well as nuclear weapons programs at the Department of Energy and other national defense priorities. The GAO report comes as U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis presented lawmakers in the House and Senate with a $33 billion wish list of unfunded military needs. The report said despite increased defense funding under Trump, efforts â€œunderway to rebuild readiness for portions of their military forcesâ€ are at risk without more comprehensive planning efforts at the Pentagon.  The federal agency, which oversees government resources, also said the Defense Department could police global hot spots with less expensive and more numerous regular troops instead of U.S. special forces.  â€œDOD has not taken steps to examine whether additional opportunities exist to reduce the high demand on these (special) forces by sharing some of their responsibilities with conventional forces,â€ the report said.  U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s fiscal 2018 budget proposal gave the military a modest boost to their budget, 3 percent more than what former President Barack Obama had sought in his long-term budget plan. The $574.5 billion for the Department of Defense would go to warfighting readiness and critical program requirements.  GAO said it has made approximately 3,100 recommendations to DOD since 2006. Of these about 1,037 have not been acted on, including 78 priority recommendations. The report released on Tuesday made no new recommendations. ",Real

" Republican Official Caught Exposing Himself Attacks Police Officer Republicans always like to claim they are the party of  family values.  As such, they oppose anything they deem to be  sinful,  such as abortion, homosexuality, or pre-marital sex. They often use their political positions as a weapon against anyone who doesn t adhere to their twisted version of  morality.  Along with this, though, almost always comes some kind of amazing example of hypocrisy in their ranks.These examples pop up pretty regularly, and here we have another one.Fifty-four-year-old David Narromore is a dentist in Kingsport, Tennessee. He is also the chairman of that state s Republican Party. Narromore has been up to some decidedly un-family values like behavior of late, though, and now he might be going to jail for it. In the men s restroom at a Belk s Department Store, a most disturbing incident involving Narromore happened, and a store employee contacted police. Apparently, Mr. Narromore was exposing himself to the employee, who just happened to be a loss prevention officer using the restroom in the stall next to Narromore.Narromore went well beyond the usual toe-tapping that happens in this case here, too. He decided it would be a good idea to stretch his foot into the unidentified employee s stall and start massaging the other man s foot with his own. As if that weren t bad enough, Narromore also whipped his d*ck out for the poor innocent employee as well. This is what prompted the call to the cops.The employee then kept Narromore in the store in his office until police arrived. Narromore was taken into custody   but not without a fight. He decided to resist arrest, refusing to comply with orders from police when they attempted to handcuff him. He became physically combative, and they had to tase him. When that didn t work, officers were forced to take Narromore to the ground in order to cuff him and take him away. He spent the night in a cell, right where he belonged, despite his efforts to make sure that didn t happen. After posting bail in the amount of $2,250, he was let out of the joint the next day. He is charged with resisting arrest and indecent exposure.Of course, the Tennessee GOP has relieved Narromore of his duties after this embarrassing dust-up. Tennessee GOP Communications Director Trent Watson says of the incident: Dr. Narramore is clearly going through some personal issues. We wish him well as he attempts to deal with (his) personal struggles. Ah, yes. In Republican circles, being gay is wrong, so that means that when one has a  lapse,  it s just  personal issues.  Maybe if this guy wasn t such a repressed closet case, he wouldn t be committing sex crimes in public restrooms. If you people weren t so archaic and hateful when it comes to LGBTQ people, the people in your ranks who are repressed homosexuals wouldn t wind up doing this sort of thing and continuously embarrassing your party.Maybe the  issues  here have to do with the wrong-headed, hateful, and dangerous views of the GOP when it comes to homosexuality, not the people who are gay, repress it due to said views, and wind up in the slammer over it.Then again, this guy, as a professional Republican, deserves no sympathy, as his hypocrisy is off the charts with this one. He pushes politicians and laws that harm LGBTQ people, then gets caught trolling for gay sex in a public men s room.  Family values,  indeed.Featured image via AJC.com/Kingsport City Jail",Fake
"AT&T lawyer says U.S. effort to stop Time Warner deal 'foolish': CNBC (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justiceâ€™s move to block AT&T Incâ€™s $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc was â€œfoolishâ€ because the deal posed no threat to consumers, the wireless carrierâ€™s trial lawyer Dan Petrocelli told CNBC on Tuesday. The Justice Department on Monday sued AT&T arguing that the U.S. No. 2 wireless carrier would use Time Warnerâ€™s content to force rival pay-TV companies to pay â€œhundreds of millions of dollars more per year for Time Warnerâ€™s networks.â€ AT&T has vowed to defend the deal. â€œWe want to go to court as soon as possible,â€ Petrocelli told CNBC, saying the burden of proof was on the government.  The case was initially assigned on Tuesday to Judge Christopher Cooper in federal court in Washington but later reassigned to Judge Richard Leon.  The case will be closely watched because U.S. President Donald Trump has been a vocal critic of Time Warnerâ€™s CNN, and opposed AT&Tâ€™s purchase of Time Warner on the campaign trail last year, saying it would concentrate too much power in AT&Tâ€™s hands.  In antitrust circles, the court fight will be closely watched since the Justice Department has not successfully litigated to stop a vertical deal - where the merging companies are not direct competitors - since the 1970s, when it prevented Ford Motor Co from buying assets from spark-plug maker Autolite.

"Treasury Secretary says Trump has approved new bank regulator WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump has made his selection for the next full-time head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, according to U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Testifying before lawmakers on Thursday, Mnuchin did not name the person tapped for the job, but said the decision had been made and the individual is going through background checks before a formal announcement. The comptroller position is currently being filled in an acting capacity by Keith Noreika, an attorney whom Mnuchin named as interim head earlier in May. Noreika replaced Thomas Curry, who had served as comptroller under President Obama. â€œWe actually have someone the president has approved that is going through the FBI vetting process,â€ Mnuchin said. â€œThis is a time-consuming process.â€  Joseph Otting, who formerly worked as a banking executive at  OneWest bank, which Mnuchin once headed, is believed to be the favorite for the position.        Mnuchin said that an OCC pick had been made in response to criticism from Democrats, who objected to Trump installing a new bank regulator on an interim basis who was not confirmed by the Senate. Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland questioned whether this approach was to skirt Senate approval. But Mnuchin insisted Noreika was put in place simply to get someone in the post while a permanent nominee was selected. The Comptrollerâ€™s office writes money-laundering rules, bank charters and closely monitors banksâ€™ lending activities. ",Real

"Trump administration, world financial officials clash over trade WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration had a simple but stark message for world financial leaders who gathered in Washington on Thursday amid worries about rising U.S. protectionism: fair trade means tit-for-tat tariffs. Speaking to bankers just hours after the formal start of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank spring meetings, White House National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn said Washington was prepared to get tougher in the trade arena. â€œIf you want to insist on having a tariff on a product - which we prefer you not - the president believes that we should treat you in a reciprocal fashion and that we should tax your product coming into the United States,â€ Cohn said. â€œThat is free, that is open, and that is fair.â€ Asked at the Institute of International Finance about his message for his international counterparts, Cohn said the United States doesnâ€™t want to be â€œtaken advantage ofâ€ any more.   â€œThe message is simple. We care about the United States of America, we care about economic prosperity, we care about economic growth, we care about trade, we care about being treated fairly,â€ he said. Earlier at the White House, President Donald Trump signed a directive to study whether steel imports into the United States should be restricted for national security reasons under a law passed in 1962. Such moves, including a review of â€œBuy Americanâ€ rules launched earlier this week, have raised concerns that the Trump administration is looking outside the World Trade Organization for remedies to restrict U.S. imports. IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde told reporters on Thursday that more needed to be done to make the global trading system fairer and expressed a willingness to work with Trump to do just that. In a news conference, Lagarde said there was a need to improve the WTO dispute settlement rules as well as reduce government subsidies for industry and tackle other trade distortions. She said the IMF would do its part in working to cut government subsidies for industry and other trade practices that limit competition, but said â€œprotectionist measuresâ€ needed to be avoided. â€œFrom the various contacts that Iâ€™ve had with the (Trump)  administration so far, I have every reason to believe that we will make progress, that we will cooperate all together in order to support and indeed improve the system as we have it,â€ Lagarde said. The IMF also has expressed concerns about the Trump administrationâ€™s plan to cut taxes, releasing reports on Wednesday that said such a move could fuel financial risk-taking and increase public debt. Appearing alongside Cohn, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he would unveil the tax plan â€œsoon, very soon,â€ and predicted it would be passed by Congress this year.  But he gave few details and shed no light on whether the plan would include a controversial border-tax component. â€œIt will be sweeping, it will be significant and it will create a lot of economic growth,â€ Mnuchin said. â€œThe plan will pay for itself with growth.â€ Separately, World Bank President Jim Yong Kim also put in a plug for free trade and said he was â€œencouragedâ€ by his engagement so far with Trump. But he added that he would not reduce the multilateral lenderâ€™s commitment to trade or to financing alternative energy projects.  â€œThe science of climate change didnâ€™t change with any particular election, and I donâ€™t see that it will,â€ Kim said at a news conference. â€œWe have to be an evidence-based organization.â€    The IMF and World Bank meetings come about a month after Mnuchin insisted that an anti-protectionism pledge be dropped from a Group of 20 communique issued in Baden-Baden, Germany. Eswar Prasad, former head of the IMFâ€™s China department, said the Trump administration may choose to simply ignore the advice of the IMF and other institutions.  â€œThe IMF has little leverage since its limited toolkit of analysis-based advice, persuasion, and peer pressure is unlikely to have much of an impact on this administrationâ€™s policies,â€ said Prasad, now an international trade professor at Cornell University. Mnuchinâ€™s decision against naming China a currency manipulator last week removed one concern for the IMF ahead of the meetings. ",Real
"White House: more Obama regulation rollbacks coming WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump hopes to sign â€œseveral moreâ€ measures into law before the end of April to roll back Obama-era regulations under the time-limited Congressional Review Act (CRA), a White House official said on Wednesday. Aggressive use by Republicans in Congress of the obscure CRA has provided them with several small-scale legislative victories at a time when they have struggled with major legislation.  Highlighting these, White House Director of Legislative Affairs Marc Short said on a conference call with reporters: â€œThere are several more that we hope to sign before this window closes on April 28.â€ The law has a short time span for introducing resolutions of disapproval: 60 legislative days after a regulation is finalized, meaning it can only be used shortly after a president of an opposing party leaves office. Since Trump, a Republican, took office on Jan. 20, House of Representatives Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy has led Congress in churning out 13 resolutions killing regulations by Democratic President Barack Obama, most of concern to business interests. Trump, who vowed in the 2016 election campaign to slash regulations, has signed 11 resolutions under the CRA, rolling back the rules they targeted and barring agencies from writing â€œsubstantially similarâ€ measures in the future. On Monday, Trump signed a CRA resolution repealing broadband privacy protections. He has also signed resolutions killing rules meant to expand background checks for mentally ill gun purchasers, change public school assessments, and reduce coal waste runoff into streams. Democrats have assailed the reversals as harmful to the environment, education and checks on Wall Street, with many saying the measures were meant to please big-money lobbyists. Last Friday was the deadline for introducing new CRA resolutions. Now Republicans must complete voting on resolutions already in the legislative pipeline. Written in 1996 and successfully used only once before 2017, the CRA was meant to restore the balance of power between Congress and the federal bureaucracy. But lobbyists and lawmakers have seized on it as a tool to repeal rules written in the final months of a preceding administration. The U.S. government has thousands of regulations, which are categorized by their impact on the economy. The Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan arm of Congress, has reported that 76 â€œmajorâ€ new rules, subject to CRA review, were written in 2015, down from 81 in 2014. The busiest year on record for major new rules was 100 in 2010. ",Real
"Trump says open to bilateral Canada, Mexico pacts if NAFTA talks fail WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he was open to bilateral trade pacts with either Canada or Mexico if a three-way deal cannot be reached to substantially revise the North American Free Trade Agreement.  Asked by a reporter if he could envision maintaining free trade with Canada if NAFTA talks sour with Mexico, Trump said: â€œOh sure, absolutely. Itâ€™s possible we wonâ€™t be able to reach a deal with one or the other, but in the meantime weâ€™ll make a deal with one.â€ Trump added that a â€œvery creativeâ€ deal was still possible to benefit all three countries. Trumpâ€™s comments came at a White House meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who was in Washington to promote NAFTAâ€™s benefits as a new round of renegotiations began near Washington. Asked about Trumpâ€™s comments at a news conference later, Trudeau said he was still optimistic about the chances of modernizing the 1994 trade pact. â€œI continue to believe in NAFTA ... so saying, we are ready for anything, and we will continue to work diligently to protect Canadian interests,â€ Trudeau said. Trudeau added that Canada was â€œvery much aware of and very braced forâ€ Trumpâ€™s unpredictability, but his government would work in a â€œthoughtful, meaningful way towards getting a good deal.â€ Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo, speaking on Mexican radio, praised Trumpâ€™s comments as â€œvery balancedâ€ to include the possibility of a deal with either country and hold out hope for a creative solution. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Tuesday accused Trumpâ€™s administration of trying to sabotage the talks with â€œpoison pill proposals,â€ including demands for more favorable treatment for the U.S. side on car production, and a â€œsunset clauseâ€ to force regular negotiations. In his appearance with Trudeau, Trump said: â€œWeâ€™ll see what happensâ€ when asked whether NAFTA was doomed. â€œItâ€™s possible we wonâ€™t be able to make a deal, and itâ€™s possible that we will,â€ he said. â€œWeâ€™ll see if we can do the kind of changes that we need. We have to protect our workers, and in all fairness, the prime minister wants to protect Canada and his people also.â€ U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, one of Trumpâ€™s top trade advisers, downplayed the chances that a NAFTA termination would become necessary. â€œWe donâ€™t hope it will, we donâ€™t desire that it will, we donâ€™t believe that it will, but it is at least a conceptual possibility as we go forward,â€ Ross said. But U.S. and Mexican corporate chief executives gathered in Mexico City said they would be better off with no NAFTA than be saddled with a â€œbad agreement.â€    Trade experts said the NAFTA talks were likely to stall in the face of aggressive U.S. attempts to sharply increase content requirements for autos and auto parts.  People briefed on U.S. proposals to be presented this week said Washington was seeking to sharply lift North American content threshold in car manufacturing. The proposals call for North American content overall to rise to 85 percent from the current 62.5 percent. In addition, the United States wants to add a new 50 percent U.S.-specific content requirement, something that was not in the earlier agreements. â€œThese will be met with widespread opposition from Canada and Mexico. I think itâ€™s just a bridge too far,â€ said Wendy Cutler, the Asia Societyâ€™s Washington policy director and former chief U.S. negotiator for the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal canceled by Trump.      The U.S. side sees strengthening the rules of origin for the auto industry as a way to bring back some auto parts production, including electronics, from Asia. But Mexico strongly opposes a U.S.-specific content requirement, which would limit the growth of its own car industry.   The difficult issue of rules of origin will be addressed mostly at the end of the current talks, according to a schedule obtained by Reuters. The negotiations were extended on Wednesday by two days to Oct 17.  Other U.S. proposals opposed by Canada, Mexico and U.S. business interests include the five-year sunset provision, radical changes to NAFTAâ€™s dispute arbitration systems, changes to intellectual property provisions and new protections for U.S. seasonal produce growers. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said on Wednesday the three nations had completed their negotiations on company competition policy, reaching an agreement that goes beyond previous U.S. trade deals to ensure â€œcertain rights and transparency under each nationâ€™s competition laws.â€  ",Real
" WATCH: Rep. Elijah Cummings Rips Republicans A New One For Witch Hunt Against Hillary House Republicans are spending much of their time and the taxpayers  money persecuting Hillary Clinton in order to sabotage her presidential campaign, and Rep. Elijah Cummings is sick of it.Over the last four days, Republicans have called three  emergency  hearings of the House Oversight Committee to investigate Hillary Clinton s emails despite the fact that FBI Director James Comey has already completely debunked GOP claims that she intentionally destroyed emails to hide something.During the third hearing on Tuesday, ranking committee member Rep. Elijah Cummings took Republicans and committee chairman Rep. Jason Chaffetz to the woodshed  or engaging in these political witch hunts. Today is the third  emergency  hearing in four business days, third emergency hearing about Secretary Clinton s e-mails in four business days,  Cummings began.  Third in four days, emergency. I believe this committee is abusing taxpayer dollars and authority of Congress in an astonishing onslaught of political attacks to damage Secretary Clinton s campaign for president of the United States of America.  Cummings continued: This is the first time in my 30 years in Congress that I have personally witnessed the Oversight power of this committee abused in such a transparently political manner to directly influence a presidential campaign.The point of today s hearing is to investigate baseless Republican accusations that Secretary Clinton, or her aides, ordered destruction of emails to conceal them from investigators. The most important fact for the day s hearing is that the FBI already investigated these accusations and thoroughly debunked them. They interviewed witnesses, examined forensic evidence and concluded that these accusations have no merit. FBI Director (James) Comey stated, and I quote,  We found no evidence that any of the additional work-related emails were intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them,  end of quote. He went on to say, and I quote,  We did not find any evidence of evil intent, intent to obstruct justice. Cummings then described the strategy Republicans are using in order to continue to attack Hillary even though their charges have been proved to be untrue. Of course, Republicans did not like the answers that the FBI director gave, so they simply manufactured today s hearing out of thin air. This entire hearing is a contrived campaign photo-op.Step one: Publicly accuse the witnesses of criminal activity, no matter how ludicrous, then refer them to attorney s office for investigation.Step two: The next day invite the same witnesses to an emergency hearing on those criminal accusations and rush to issue a flurry of unilateral subpoenas demanding they testify. No debate, no vote.Step three: Express false outrage when these witnesses   this is a playbook   express false outrage when these witnesses, who you just accused of criminal activity take advice from their counsel to assert their Fifth Amendment right to not testify. There you have it   presto, instant photo op. Here s the video via YouTube.Republicans should pay a heavy price for relentlessly attacking Hillary Clinton in Congress like they have been doing over the years with their never-ending investigations into Benghazi and her emails. It s a total waste of money and time. But they would rather spend it on political persecution and character assassination instead of on dealing with real problems facing our nation.Featured image via screen capture",Fake
" WATCH: White Racist Tells Black Quarterback To Stand For National Anthem Or Lose Citizenship Glenn Beck stooge Tomi Lahren thinks that citizenship in this country requires that we always stand for the national anthem and respect the flag, even though we have the right to not do either.But the whiny white racist took to Facebook on Monday night to lecture San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick and threaten his constitutionally protected citizenship because he chose to sit during the national anthem on Friday in protest of police brutality against black people. I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,  Kaepernick told the press.  To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder. Kaepernick is following in the footsteps of athletes like Muhammad Ali and Jackie Robinson, and like them, he has been viciously attacked by racists like Lahren for drawing attention to the plight of African-Americans in this country. Colin, if this country disgusts you so much   leave,  Lahren said.  I guarantee there are thousands and thousands of people around the world who would gladly take your spot, because those that don t live under this flag are banging on the door to get in, not get out. Remember that. Except that Lahren and her conservative allies have actively supported Donald Trump, who has called for building a wall to keep Latinos out of the country and called for banning Muslims from immigrating here. So when Lahren says  thousands of people  you gotta wonder exactly what people she is talking about. All people or just those with white skin who practice Christianity?Lahren then got personal and demonstrated why black voters will never vote Republican. What s your contribution? Sitting there like a fool?  Lahren viciously continued.  What s selfish is you, buddy. And what s your message to black kids, to people of color? That their biggest contribution to justice and self-fulfillment is to parade around with a chip on their shoulder like a victim? Basically, Lahren is saying that fighting for civil rights and equality means that black people are playing the victim because people like her think racism doesn t exist in America.And then she lectured about how white people are not to blame for problems in black communities, even though white lawmakers established systemic racism that has lasted for decades in order to keep black Americans at a disadvantage compared to their white counterparts. Once again, Lahren got personal. Colin, how dare you sit there and blame white people for the problems (in) the minority communities?After all, aren t you half white? Didn t two white parents adopt you after yours weren t willing to raise you? For a racist and horrible country filled with racist and horrible white people, that s really something, isn t it? Here s the video via Facebook:Of course, Kaepernick never specifically blamed white people for anything in his remarks. He is simply speaking out against police brutality against black people, something that has become an epidemic in this country.But you won t hear Lahren talk about police brutality. She thinks the police are totally justified when they shoot black people and has said police will keep killing black people until they stop protesting.This vile piece of trailer park trash has been on the air long enough. It s one thing to have an opinion, but when that opinion is ignorant and hateful it should not be allowed to spread like the plague to poison other minds.Featured Image: Screenshot",Fake
"Trump tax push raises questions about scope of his 'reform' WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trumpâ€™s zeal to unveil a tax plan before his 100th day in office is raising questions about just how thorough his â€œtax reformâ€ plans will be, amid signals that his focus for now is on slashing tax rates. Trump has directed aides to move quickly on a plan to cut the corporate income tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent, a Trump administration official said on Monday. With his 100th day nearing on April 29, Trump has been ordering studies and signing executive orders. But he has yet to introduce a major bill to the Republican-controlled Congress on any topic or win passage of someone elseâ€™s that he supports. He has promised a â€œbig tax reform and tax reductionâ€ announcement on Wednesday. Some analysts said this may consist of a proposal to cut the corporate rate to 15 percent, cap the individual tax rate at 33 percent, repeal the estate and alternative minimum taxes and cut taxes for the middle class. In earlier days, Trump vowed to oversee the biggest â€œtax reformâ€ since President Ronald Reaganâ€™s in 1986, a legislative feat that has since defied every president. Wall Street analysts say Trump may instead offer a package of rate reductions, like those backed by Reagan in 1981 and President George W. Bush in 2001, which left the tax system intact.  If that is the case, it â€œis not tax reform. It is a tax cut,â€ Chris Krueger, analyst at financial firm Cowen & Co, said in a research note. On Wednesday, Krueger said, â€œWe will get some vague benchmarks about rate levels... with likely no detail on how to finance those reductions except for the assurance that the growth projections will take care of it.â€ The announcement could also show whether Trump is turning away from a Republican plan backed by House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan that would pay for tax cuts with an import tax and by killing a business interest deduction. Ryan and other Republicans will get a preview of Trumpâ€™s plan on Tuesday at a Capitol Hill meeting with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Gary Cohn, director of Trumpâ€™s National Economic Council, aides said. Trumpâ€™s announcement, however, could be a disappointment for investors seeking clarity.  â€œI donâ€™t know that it will shed a great deal of light beyond what the administration has already said,â€ noted Peter Cohn, analyst at financial firm Height Securities.

" With Irma About To Strike Florida, Trump Begs For Donations To His Re-Election Campaign Trump has been tweeting about Hurricane Irma sort of for the last couple of days. His tweets mostly consist of bragging that his emergency teams are ready and telling people to stay safe. But while he s pretending to be concerned, he s also sending out messages begging people for donations; not to the charities and rescue organizations that are, and will be, on the ground in Florida during and after Irma, but to himself and his 2020 campaign.He s not even making a pretense of asking for donations to help him help those in Irma s path. Seriously. This is what he s sending out to his followers:The link in the above image goes to the donation page on Trump s campaign site, where a video again attacks career politicians and the media, and goes into his usual spiel about  Let s finish the job,  and  Make America great again.  It s ridiculously tone-deaf in light of how many are scrambling to aid those in Irma s path.He bragged about his response to the devastation of Hurricane Harvey, but he s not really doing anything but tweeting about Irma and closing Mar-a-Lago ahead of landfall. He s made a Facebook video that, like his tweets, urges people to get out of Irma s way, but many don t have that choice.The federal government has three major relief efforts to deal with right now: Ongoing recovery efforts in Texas and Louisiana, live-saving efforts in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands (where Irma has already hit), and evacuation and preparation efforts in Florida, which is more or less closed and in chaos.Trump will  monitor  Irma from the safety of Camp David and beg for donations to his campaign instead of do some real work.His timing for this kind of a message is especially poor. If he wants to ask for donations, fine. But he should be directing people to donate to the non-profits and other organizations that are on the ground everywhere in Irma s path and put his stupid, vapid campaign on hold. His priorities are clear, and they do not lie with the American people.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",Fake

" Hereâ€™s Absolute PROOF Donald Trump Thinks The Government Is A Reality Show; We Should All Be Terrified Donald Trump, despite having a face and hairline made for radio, is convinced that the way to run a government is to hold casting calls. He wants to choose cabinet nominees who look the part, rather than nominees who are qualified. Presentation is very important because you re representing America not only on the national stage but also the international stage, depending on the position,  said Trump transition spokesman Jason Miller.To lead the Pentagon, Trump chose a rugged combat general, whom he compares to a historic one. At the United Nations, his ambassador will be a poised and elegant Indian American with a compelling immigrant backstory. As secretary of state, Trump tapped a neophyte to international diplomacy, but one whose silvery hair and boardroom bearing project authority.Source: Washington PostFor some reason, die-hard conservatives are not at all bothered by this method of choosing the people who will be responsible for our health and safety. He likes people who present themselves very well, and he s very impressed when somebody has a background of being good on television because he thinks it s a very important medium for public policy,  said Chris Ruddy, chief executive of Newsmax Media and a longtime friend of Trump.  Don t forget, he s a showbiz guy. He was at the pinnacle of showbiz, and he thinks about showbiz. He sees this as a business that relates to the public. The look might not necessarily be somebody who should be on the cover of GQ magazine or Vanity Fair,  Ruddy said.  It s more about the look and the demeanor and the swagger. Trump allegedly chose Marine Gen. James Mattis as his nominee for Secretary of Defense because he is  the closest thing to General George Patton that we have.  That s in reference to a physical resemblance, not his abilities as a general. Trump also chose Mike Pence for his looks and teased that he was going to choose Mitt Romney for Secretary of State for his looks. If our Republican Congress gave a crap about the people they represent, they would shut down these  central casting  nominees from the start, but this style of hiring fits right in with the Republican agenda, which is to take the government down from the inside.Featured image via Ty Wright/Getty Images",Fake
"Federal judge in Hawaii extends court order blocking Trump travel ban HONOLULU (Reuters) - A federal judge in Hawaii indefinitely extended on Wednesday an order blocking enforcement of President Donald Trumpâ€™s revised  ban on travel to the United States from six predominantly Muslim countries. U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson turned an earlier temporary restraining order into a preliminary injunction in a lawsuit brought by the state of Hawaii challenging Trumpâ€™s travel directive as unconstitutional religious discrimination.  Trump signed the new ban on March 6 in a bid to overcome legal problems with a January executive order that caused chaos at airports and sparked mass protests before a Washington judge stopped its enforcement in February. Trump has said the travel ban is needed for national security. In its challenge to the travel ban, Hawaii claims its state universities would be harmed by the order because they would have trouble recruiting students and faculty. It also says the island stateâ€™s economy would be hit by a decline in tourism. The court papers cite reports that travel to the United States â€œtook a nosediveâ€ after Trumpâ€™s actions. The state was joined by a new plaintiff named Ismail Elshikh, an American citizen from Egypt who is an imam at the Muslim Association of Hawaii and whose mother-in-law lives in Syria, according to the lawsuit. Hawaii and other opponents of the ban claim that the motivation behind it is based on religion and Trumpâ€™s election campaign promise of â€œa total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.â€ â€œThe court will not crawl into a corner, pull the shutters closed, and pretend it has not seen what it has,â€ Watson wrote on Wednesday. Watson wrote that his decision to grant the preliminary injunction was based on the likelihood that the state would succeed in proving that the travel ban violated the U.S. Constitutionâ€™s religious freedom protection. Trump has vowed to take the case to the U.S. Supreme Court, which is currently split 4-4 between liberals and conservatives with the presidentâ€™s pick - appeals court judge Neil Gorsuch - still awaiting confirmation.

"U.S. senators reach deal on Russia sanctions WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. senators reached an agreement on Monday on legislation imposing new sanctions on Russia, including a provision that would prevent the White House from easing, suspending or ending sanctions without congressional approval. The agreement, to be filed as an amendment to an Iran sanctions bill, is intended to punish Russia over issues including its alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, annexation of Ukraineâ€™s Crimea region and support for the government of Syria in that countryâ€™s six-year-long civil war. [L1N1J41LS] The Iran bill is due come up for a vote as soon as this week. Besides the provision setting up a process for Congress to review changes in sanctions, the measure would put into law sanctions previously established via presidential executive order, including some on certain Russian energy projects and debt financing in some industries. It would impose new sanctions on Russians found to be guilty of human rights abuses, supplying weapons to Syriaâ€™s government and conduct cyber attacks on behalf of Russiaâ€™s government, among others. The measure also would allow new sanctions on Russian mining, metals, shipping and railways. The legislation is backed by both Republicans and Democrats, and is expected to easily pass the Senate. It was introduced amid an intense focus in the U.S. capital on relations with Russia, and investigations by the Department of Justice and congressional committees of whether Russia sought to influence the 2016 U.S. elections to help elect Republican President Donald Trump, and whether Trump associates colluded with Moscow as it sought to influence the election.  To become law, the legislation would have to pass the House of Representatives and be signed into law by Trump. If Trump objected, some of its backers said they expected enough congressional support to override a veto. â€œThese additional sanctions will ... send a powerful and bipartisan statement to Russia and any other country who might try to interfere in our elections that they will be punished,â€ Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement. Russia has denied attempting to interfere in the U.S election, and Trump has dismissed any talk of collusion. The measure also authorizes â€œrobust assistanceâ€ to strengthen democratic institutions and counter disinformation in European countries that might be targeted by what the legislationâ€™s sponsors described as Russian aggression. In December, the final full month of President Barack Obamaâ€™s administration, Washington sanctioned Russian businessmen and companies for Moscowâ€™s role in Ukraine via executive order.   ",Real

"Key Republican says Trump must work with Europe on Iran WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, urged President Donald Trumpâ€™s administration on Monday to work closely with European allies as it develops its new Iran policy. â€œThis is something that can only work if the administration exercises tremendous diplomacy with our European allies,â€ Corker told reporters as the Senate returned to the Capitol for the first time since Trump announced his Iran policy. Trump defied both allies and adversaries on Friday by refusing to certify that Iran is complying with an international agreement on its nuclear program, and threatened that he might ultimately terminate the accord. Corker is leading an effort in Congress to write legislation setting new conditions for the U.S. role in the pact, such as automatically reimposing sanctions if Iran is deemed to be within one year of developing a nuclear weapon. Details have not been finalized, but the planâ€™s outline raised concerns that it might cause Washington - not Tehran - to violate the deal reached with Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China, Iran and the European Union. Corker said Democratic senators told him that Washington must work with Europe. Trumpâ€™s fellow Republicans control the Senate and House of Representatives, but their Senate majority is so narrow that most legislation needs Democratic votes to pass. European Union foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg on Monday reaffirmed their support for the nuclear pact and said failure to uphold it could have serious consequences for regional peace, and undermine efforts to check North Koreaâ€™s nuclear ambitions. Corker said he had tried to convince European officials that the news on Iran was not all bad. â€œI ... shared with them that, look, if I were them, Iâ€™d look at this as â€˜the glass is half full,â€™ he didnâ€™t withdraw from the JCPOA (the nuclear deal), and thatâ€™s step one,â€ Corker said.  He described efforts under way in Washington as a chance to address â€œdeficienciesâ€ in the nuclear pact, in which Iran agreed to curb its nuclear ambitions in exchange for sanctions relief. Every Republican in Congress, as well as some Democrats, opposed the accord when it was reached by former Democratic Barack Obamaâ€™s administration in 2015. Corker and Republican Senator Tom Cotton, who worked with him on the legislation, met later on Monday on Iran with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. ",Real

"Republican lawmaker quits conservative House group over healthcare conflict WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican U.S. Representative Ted Poe resigned from the House Freedom Caucus on Sunday over the conservative legislative groupâ€™s role in sinking a healthcare overhaul championed by President Donald Trump. â€œSaying no is easy, leading is hard, but that is what we were elected to do,â€ the Texas lawmaker said in a statement. â€œLeaving this caucus will allow me to be a more effective member of Congress.â€ Poe was in favor of the Republican legislation, but the Freedom Caucus argued the proposal did not go far enough in repealing the 2010 Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare. The Freedom Caucus, consisting of the House of Representativesâ€™ most conservative members, was instrumental in dealing Trump a stunning political setback on Friday when Republican House leaders pulled the healthcare legislation, derailing a major 2016 election campaign promise of the president and his allies. Trumpâ€™s fellow Republicans control both houses of Congress. Trump had courted Freedom Caucus lawmakers intensively. Outside conservative groups such as the Club for Growth and Heritage Action for America that are closely aligned with the Freedom Caucus had strongly opposed the Republican healthcare bill and urged lawmakers to vote against it. In a tweet on Sunday morning, Trump lashed out at both the Freedom Caucus and other conservatives, saying their actions had left â€œDemocrats smiling in D.C.â€ ",Real

"Trump's FBI pick vows independence, says Russia probe no 'witch hunt' WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trumpâ€™s pick to head the FBI, Christopher Wray, on Wednesday said he would refuse to pledge loyalty to Trump, rejected his description of the probe into Russian election meddling as a â€œwitch hunt,â€ and vowed to quit if asked by the president to do something unlawful. Wray, nominated by Trump on June 7 to replace the fired James Comey as Federal Bureau of Investigation director, sought to stake out independence from the president and protect the agency from partisan political influence. Wray even said it would be â€œhighly unlikelyâ€ he would agree to meet Trump in a one-on-one situation, as Comey reluctantly did. Wray, who seemed headed for U.S. Senate approval to fill the 10-year post, testified during a 4 1/2-hour hour Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing amid an uproar in Washington over 2016 emails released on Tuesday involving the presidentâ€™s son, Donald Trump Jr. The emails showed the Republican presidentâ€™s son agreeing last year to meet a woman he was told was a Russian government lawyer who might have damaging information about Democratic White House rival Hillary Clinton as part of Moscowâ€™s official support for his father. Wray deflected specific questions from Republican Senator Lindsey Graham about the presidentâ€™s sonâ€™s emails, saying he had not read them. But Wray said, â€œAny threats or effort to interfere with our election from any nation-state or any non-state actor is the kind of thing the FBI would want to know.â€ Trumpâ€™s son did not notify the FBI and wrote â€œI love itâ€ about the Russianâ€™s offer of information on Clinton. Trump fired Comey on May 9, igniting a political firestorm, and later cited the â€œRussia thingâ€ as his reason. The Justice Department eight days later named Robert Mueller to serve as special counsel to investigate alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential race to help Trump win and potential collusion between Moscow and Trump associates. The Russia matter has dogged Trumpâ€™s first six months in office. Wray said he had no reason to doubt the U.S. intelligence communityâ€™s conclusion that Russia interfered in part by hacking and releasing emails damaging to Clinton, a claim Moscow denies. Wray worked at the Justice Department under Republican former President George W. Bush when Comey was deputy attorney general and Mueller was FBI director. Wray also represented New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in a political scandal. Trump has called the Russia probe a â€œwitch hunt.â€ â€œI do not consider Director Mueller to be on a witch hunt,â€ Wray told Graham. Wray said he was â€œvery committedâ€ to supporting Muellerâ€™s investigation, calling him a â€œconsummate straight shooter and somebody I have enormous respect for.â€ Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein asked Wray to inform the committee â€œif you learn about any machinations to tamper withâ€ Muellerâ€™s probe. â€œUnderstood,â€ Wray responded. Wray said no one at the White House had asked that he pledge loyalty to Trump, as Comey said the president demanded of him on Jan. 26. Wray said he would not give such an assurance if asked. â€œMy loyalty is to the Constitution, to the rule of law and to the mission of the FBI. And no one asked me for any kind of loyalty oath at any point during this process, and I sure as heck didnâ€™t offer one,â€ Wray said. Comey previously told the same committee Trump pressed him in a one-on-one session to drop the FBI investigation into former national security advisor Michael Flynnâ€™s ties to Russia. Comey said he felt he was fired in a bid by Trump to undercut the Russia probe. Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy asked Wray, â€œIf the president asks you to do something unlawful or unethical, what do you say?â€ â€œFirst, I would try to talk him out of it. And if that failed, I would resign,â€ Wray replied. The allegation involving Trump pressing Comey on Feb. 14 over the Flynn probe raised questions about whether Trumpâ€™s behavior amounted to obstruction of justice, a potential issue in any potential future effort in Congress to impeach the president and remove him from office. Wray sought to differentiate himself from Comey. Wray was asked about Comeyâ€™s July 2016 news conference announcing that no criminal charges were planned against Clinton over her use of a private email server to handle classified information but faulting her conduct. â€œI canâ€™t imagine a situation where as FBI director I would be giving a press conference on an uncharged individual, much less talk in detail about it,â€ Wray testified. Graham questioned Wray about a January report by the U.S. news organization Politico that a Ukrainian-American operative who was consulting for the Democratic National Committee had met with Ukrainian embassy officials in Washington in a bid to help Clinton and expose links between Trump, top campaign aide Paul Manafort and Russia. Wray said it would be wrong for Ukraine to meddle in the election and â€œIâ€™d be happy to dig into it.â€ ",Real

" Texas Elector Resigns: â€˜Voting For Trump Would Bring Dishonor To Godâ€™ A Republican member of the Electoral College representing Texas, Art Sisneros, wrote on Saturday that he will resign and turn his position over to an alternate elector. Sisneros has previously been skeptical of throwing his support behind Donald Trump but now, he says he would rather resign than to vote against his conscience.In August, Sisneros thought of participating as a  faithless  elector, but in a largely unnoticed blog post over the weekend he wrote that he cannot bring himself to vote for Trump, so he decided to resign from his role as an elector, according to Politico. The Electoral College was corrupted from its original intent once states started dictating the votes of the Electors,  he writes. If Trump is not qualified and my role, both morally and historically, as an elected official is to vote my conscience, then I can not and will not vote for Donald Trump for President. I believe voting for Trump would bring dishonor to God,  Sisneros wrote.  The reality is Trump will be our President, no matter what my decision is. Sisneros said that he will  mourn the loss of our republic. Since I can t in good conscience vote for Donald Trump, and yet have sinfully made a pledge that I would, the best option I see at this time is to resign my position as an Elector,  Sisneros continued.  This will allow the remaining body of Electors to fill my vacancy when they convene on Dec 19 with someone that can vote for Trump. The people will get their vote   I will sleep well at night knowing I neither gave in to their demands nor caved to my convictions. I will also mourn the loss of our republic. This sounds similar to what Ted Cruz demanded people do. Vote your conscience. But the Texas Senator lost his spine, soul and conscience during the eleventh hour, then threw his support behind Trump. Ted Cruz is no Art Sisneros.____________________________________________________________________________________Image via Facebook.",Fake
" Trump And His â€˜Street Fightersâ€™ Prepare To Wage War On Leaks, Investigations (DETAILS) Donald Trump has become increasingly paranoid and frustrated as the investigation into ties between his 2016 presidential campaign, his outside associates, and perhaps even himself and the Russian government heats up. There have already been two rounds of subpoenas issued to Trump s disgraced National Security Adviser, Michael Flynn, regarding this matter. Further, it doesn t help that Trump s own White House is leaking like a sieve to the New York Times and the Washington Post regarding the chaos within   especially when it comes to the handling of the Russia matter. Things are so worrisome at this point that Trump has already hired outside lawyers to represent him. So, how is Team Trump planning to handle all the scandal that continues to plague their White House? Why, they are going to wage war on investigators and leakers   for years, if necessary.Axios is reporting that Trump will have his  street fighters  devise a plan to target leaks from within the intelligence community and other parts of the government with zeal, and they also have come to realize that the Russia investigation is not going away just because they want it to. They cannot fire or lie their way out of this one, and the press isn t going to let go of a story this big. According to a Trump-backer, they are ready for this fight: The White House is embracing the fight, which is going to last as long as Donald Trump is president. We re getting street fighters ready to go. Axios has also obtained a detailed a  war room  plan regarding this escalating war between the White House and the rest of the government:The thing is, though, that the Trump White House can t even function on a day to day basis. They aren t even staffed up like a normal White House would be by now. The same goes for other major administration agencies, such as the State Department. Further, the chaos inside barely allows the staffers to get anything at all done other than try to control Trump s television time, feed him positive news so that he doesn t go off the rails too often, and to control his tweeting   which they seem to be failing miserable at.The idea that these incompetent wannabe authoritarians are any match for the apparatus of the United States government is downright laughable. Likely, we ll just get even more self-incrimination and meme-worthy buffoonery out of this plan.Good luck, Trump staffers. You ll need it.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",Fake
" Atlanta Mayor And Newspaper DESTROY Trump For Attacking Their City And Rep. John Lewis Donald Trump called Atlanta a  crime infested  city that is  falling apart  in response to Rep. John Lewis calling him illegitimate. That was a YUUUGE mistake.One of America s most influential southern cities just hit back at Trump for attacking the congressman who represents them in a scathing editorial on the front page of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution on Sunday.Earlier this week, Rep. Lewis stated his belief that Trump is an illegitimate president. In response, Trump attacked Lewis on Twitter and the district Lewis represents, which includes the city of Atlanta, Georgia.Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 14, 2017mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results. All talk, talk, talk   no action or results. Sad!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 14, 2017Trump literally accused Lewis of being  all talk  and  no action.  This comes from a wealthy prick who dodged the draft during the Vietnam War and obtained his riches through inheritance while Lewis was busy fighting for civil rights and voting rights, and getting beaten by police for it during the Civil Rights Movement. Indeed, Lewis has been a tireless crusader for equal rights and a tireless public servant for the city of Atlanta, the state of Georgia, and the United States.Trump immediately drew backlash for his attack, including from Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed..@RepJohnLewis is an American hero & a national treasure. Period. Full stop.

It runs from Buckhead to Decatur, over to Atlanta s Westside and reaches south to include Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport and parts of Clayton County. Georgia went for Trump, but the 5th Congressional District and the city of Atlanta as a whole remain solidly Democratic and supported Hillary Clinton over Trump in November.The district that Trump described as in  horrible shape  includes Emory University and Morehouse College, as well as Spelman College and Georgia Tech. The Coca-Cola headquarters is just one of that district s many, high-profile corporate residents. Lewis represents Midtown s shiny residential high-rises and the pricey Intown neighborhoods filled with renovated homes, the Beltline and Ponce City Market.The newspaper also pointed out that Trump once sought to build a skyscraper in the same city he is now calling  horrible  and  crime infested. Atlantans understood Saturday that a political fight was playing out. But, the city wondered, did Trump, who once aspired to add his own skyscraper to the city s skyline, really think Atlanta was a depressing, dangerous place to live? In short, Trump is a hypocritical bully who will do anything to attack someone who criticizes him, even if it means flat-out lying.Featured image by Drew Angerer via Getty Images",Fake

"EU foreign policy chief concerned over proposed cuts in U.S. aid WASHINGTON (Reuters) - European Foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini expressed concern on Monday over the Trump administrationâ€™s proposed deep cut in U.S. foreign assistance, saying it would destabilize major parts of the world and hurt American national security. â€œInvesting in America means investing in places that are far away,â€ Mogherini said during an international conference on nuclear policy in Washington. Trump has proposed a 28 percent reduction in the State Departmentâ€™s budget, which would translate into steep cuts in U.S. funds for foreign aid and the United Nations.  Mogherini also strongly defended the Iran nuclear deal, pointing out that the U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, has five times confirmed Iranâ€™s compliance with the 2015 agreement designed to stop it from developing nuclear weapons. â€œThere is no alternativeâ€ to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear arsenal, she said, adding that she believed Tehran was committed to adhering to the deal. U.S. President Donald Trump has harshly criticized the agreement, which was negotiated between Iran, the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and the European Union. The deal lifted international sanctions on Iran in return for Tehran accepting restrictions on its nuclear program. Mogherini ruled out the possibility of renegotiating the agreement. Some U.S. critics have said the pact does not do enough to prevent Iran from gaining further nuclear technology. ",Real
"U.S. consumer watchdog agency official sues to block Trump's pick WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau official filed suit late on Sunday trying to prevent President Donald Trump from naming an acting head of the watchdog agency, but its top lawyer concluded Trump had the power to do so. The moves were the latest dramatic developments in the fight over leadership succession of an agency created in 2011 under Democratic former President Barack Obama to protect consumers from predatory lending practices. Republicans in the White House and Congress have tried to weaken the agency. The leadership of the agency was plunged into confusion on Friday after its outgoing Obama-era director Richard Cordray formally resigned and elevated his former chief of staff, Leandra English, to replace him on an interim basis until the Senate confirms a permanent successor named by Trump. Hours later, the Republican president named Mulvaney â€” his budget chief and a harsh critic of the agency â€” as its acting director. CFPB General Counsel Mary McLeod wrote a memo, first reported by Reuters, concurring with the opinion of the U.S. Justice Department that Trump had the power to appoint Mulvaney to the post. â€œI advise all Bureau personnel to act consistently with the understanding that Director Mulvaney is the Acting Director of the CFPB,â€ McLeodâ€™s memo stated. Late on Sunday, English sued in U.S. District Court in Washington, seeking a temporary restraining order blocking Trump from appointing Mulvaney. In the filing, English said Mulvaney had no experience in a consumer protection or financial regulatory role, had sought to get rid of the agency and once described it as a â€œsad, sick joke.â€ McLeodâ€™s intervention bolstered Trumpâ€™s position and isolated English, 34, who has held multiple jobs at the CFPB since its creation. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said the Trump administration is aware of Englishâ€™s lawsuit, but said â€œthe law is clearâ€ and that Mulvaney is the acting director. Sanders pointed to McLeodâ€™s conclusion, adding that â€œthere should be no questionâ€ that Mulvaney can take the job. â€œIt is unfortunate that Mr. Cordray decided to put his political ambition above the interests of consumers with this stunt. Director Mulvaney will bring a more serious and professional approach to running the CFPB,â€ Sanders said. Both sides in the battle say they have the law on their side. Democrats have said the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law that created the agency stipulated that its deputy director would take over on an interim basis when a director departs until the Senate confirms a permanent director. Cordray named English as deputy director and said she would become the acting director. â€œItâ€™s a very important fact ... their own general counsel came out with a different conclusion,â€ said Alan Kaplinsky, head of the Consumer Financial Services Group for law firm Ballard Spahr LLP said. â€œNow that the thing is in court, I think it is really going to be in the hands of the judge.â€ Trump administration officials said the 1998 Federal Vacancies Reform Act gives a president the power to temporarily fill agency positions, except for those with multi-member boards, an exemption they said did not apply to the CFPB. â€œThe presidentâ€™s attempt to install a White House official at the head of independent agency â€” while allowing that official to simultaneously serve in the White House â€” is unprecedented,â€ said Englishâ€™s lawyer, Deepak Gupta of the law firm Gupta Wessler, adding that â€œthe law is clearâ€ and that English is the acting director. Created after the 2008 financial crisis, the CFPB has issued rules and imposed steep penalties on banks, auto dealers, student lenders and credit card companies. [L8N1NW0MW]  Future enforcement activities could be stymied while the question of who runs the CFPB is decided.  Republican lawmakers argue that the agency wields too much unchecked power, adding that it burdens banks and credit card companies with unnecessary red tape.  Writing on Twitter, Trump on Saturday called the agency a â€œtotal disasterâ€ that had â€œdevastatedâ€ financial institutions. ",Real
"Lufthansa changes flight routes after latest North Korea missile testing FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Airline Lufthansa said on Friday it had changed its flight routes to Japan because of North Korean missile tests.

" Republicans Just Added What They Hated The Most About Obamacare To Their Bill For the years since the debate over the Affordable Care Act began, anti-government Republicans (is there another kind?) have been bitching about the individual mandate that required people to buy insurance.Now it s their turn to come up with an alternative, and while theirs will cover fewer people, their solution is to force everyone to buy it, regardless of whether they can afford the barely subsidized coverage.The addition, which was tacked onto the Republican healthcare bill on Monday, is somewhat different from the individual mandate in the Affordable Care Act, which says that there would be a penalty for people who lack coverage for more than 63 days. In the GOP bill, it s even worse. People would be barred from coverage at all for six months if they have a 63 day gap.Republicans added this provision after economists and health policy experts convinced them that it would be unsustainable to not force people to purchase insurance.Health policy experts across the political spectrum had warned that the initial Senate bill s failure to include some penalty for going uninsured could cause a  death spiral  in which people go without health insurance while healthy and only buy it when they become sick. In that scenario, insurance premiums shoot up for everyone as insurance markets become flooded with customers who disproportionately require expensive treatments.Source: NBC NewsThe main difference between this and the Affordable Care Act, though, is that the cost of premiums are going to be much higher. According to the Congressional Budget Office, 22 million Americans stand to lose their healthcare coverage if the GOP bill becomes law.By and large, Republicans want to do away with the Medicaid expansion, which allowed poorer people access to insurance, often without paying anything. Everyone who makes under $48,000 a year receives subsidies to help pay for insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Instead with Trumpcare, they want to offer those people a block grant, which would severely restrict medical spending. Instead of subsidies, there will be tax credits.Some who aren t receiving Medicaid or Medicare might see more affordable premiums, but that s only because the coverage will be so much less.Republicans have now chosen to take the most controversial portion of the Affordable Care Act and make it absolutely draconian. If you happen to be one of the 22 million who loses insurance, good luck getting it back.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",Fake

" Amid Accusations Of Hillary Selling Access For Cash, Trump Is Selling Access For Cash Donald Trump has a new fundraising scheme. He s raffling off lunch with his son Eric and a tour of the Trump campaign headquarters. While this is pretty standard political fundraising fare, it does show how ridiculous and disingenuous Trump s latest attacks against Hillary Clinton actually are.The latest  revelation  about Clinton is that as Secretary of State, she sometimes held meetings with donors to the Clinton Foundation. She also often ignored the requests for meetings, which is completely overlooked by the right-wing press.Trump has taken the report and run with it, calling it  pay to play,  and noting that it s illegal. A couple of very bad ones came out, and it s called pay for play,  he said.  And some of these were really, really bad and illegal. If it s true, it s illegal. You re paying and you re getting things. Source: Politico Paying and getting things,  isn t illegal. That s called capitalism. Paying government officials to get things that only government officials can give   that s called pay to play and yes, that is illegal. There s no evidence that Hillary Clinton did that, unless you count an occasional meeting as  getting things.  Ask absolutely anyone in Hollywood what a meeting means; hell, ask Donald Trump what a meeting means, and you d find that with successful people, a meeting is as much a way of shutting people up as it is an exchange of ideas, let alone favors. Meetings never have and never will imply obligation.Now, let s talk about actual pay to play, the highly illegal type. Donald Trump has actually bragged about bribing politicians and judges. That s unethical at best and illegal at worst. I was a businessman,  Trump smarmed at a debate earlier this year. He was being pressed about the piles of dough he has deposited in Democratic coffers through the years   for his pals the Clintons (including the Clinton Ca-ching Foundation), Schumer, Reid, Pelosi, Cuomo, Rahm, and the rest of the gang. I give to everybody. When they call, I give. You know what? When I need something from them, two years later, three years later, I call them, and they are there for me. . . . And that s a broken system. Source: National ReviewYes, that is a broken system   one Trump is happy to keep broken.Oh, but it gets worse. Trump also allegedly bribes people, as he allegedly bribed people involved in the Trump University case.The trouble started in June, when the Associated Press reported that Bondi  personally solicited a political contribution from Donald Trump  in 2013 right around the time she was deciding whether or not to investigate alleged fraud at Trump University. Trump University, of course, is the controversial for-profit school owned by presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.It was only four days after Bondi announced she might join an investigation into Trump University when a Trump family foundation gave $25,000 to a political group supporting Bondi s re-election. After that money came in, Bondi said she would not pursue a lawsuit against Trump University.

You know, we may never know the answer to that,  Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach told MSNBC s Katy Tur when asked whether he thought Clinton won the popular vote by 3 to 5 million votes. We will probably never know the answer to that question,  he said. In reality, Clinton only won by 2.87 million votes   but Kobach is a moron. How do you say we may never know the answer to that question?  Tur asked. Then things got really stupid: What I m saying is, let s suppose that the commission determined that there were a certain number of votes cast by ineligible voters. You still won t know whether those people who were ineligible voted for Trump or for Clinton or for somebody else.And so, it s impossible to ever know exactly, if you took out all the ineligible votes, what the final tally would be in that election. You can obviously, based on the data, you can make some very educated guesses. So are the votes for Donald Trump that led him to win the election in doubt as well?  Tur pressed. Absolutely,  replied Kobach.Voter fraud   especially in-person   is extremely rare, though a couple of Trump supporters have been caught illegally voting multiple times after he told them people would illegally vote for Hillary Clinton.In other words, the system works and people who try to vote illegally do get caught. The integrity of the voting systems themselves, however, could be questioned as Russian agents provably hacked our electoral system in 39 states.Is Donald Trump the legitimate President? The answer is that  he s an idiot  until we know the full extent of Russian attacks on our election.Watch the interview below:",Fake

Trump will meet with leaders from Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America throughout the week, but his remarks, scheduled for Tuesday morning, will be the presidentâ€™s highest profile opportunity to explain his foreign policy vision couched in his â€œAmerica firstâ€ agenda. â€œI personally think he slaps the right people, he hugs the right people, and he comes out with (the) U.S. being very strong, in the end,â€ Haley, speaking at the White House, said of Trumpâ€™s speech. Haley declined to say whether Trump would commit Washington to maintaining its current level of funding for the 193-nation body. Trump has complained that the United States funds 22 percent of the U.N. budget and nearly 30 percent of U.N. peacekeeping duties. Trump will kick off the week with a meeting about U.N. reform on Monday. He will then have meetings with French President Emmanuel Macron and Israeli Prime Minister Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that will focus on Iran, McMaster said. Trump has dinner scheduled with Latin American leaders. On Tuesday, he will meet Qatarâ€™s emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani. Trump said last week he would be willing to mediate the worst dispute in decades between Qatar and U.S.-allied Arab states. On Wednesday, he will meet with leaders from Jordan, the Palestinian Authority, Britain and Egypt and on Thursday there are talks scheduled with leaders from Turkey, Afghanistan and Ukraine before holding a lunch with the leaders of South Korea and Japan. McMaster said it was unlikely that Trump would speak to Venezuelaâ€™s President Nicolas Maduro, whom the White House has sanctioned and called a dictator. ",Real
"U.S. lawmakers back Syria strikes, demand a plan from Trump WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Members of the U.S. Congress from both parties on Friday backed President Donald Trumpâ€™s cruise missile strikes on Syria, but demanded he develop a strategy for dealing with the broader conflict and consult with Congress on any further action. In the biggest foreign policy decision of his presidency, Trump ordered the firing of cruise missiles at a Syrian air base that U.S. officials said was the launching point for a deadly chemical weapons attack against Syrian civilians this week. â€œThe strike was well planned, well executed. It was certainly more than a pinprick, and sends a message ... that using chemical weapons again is not something (Syrian president Bashar al-Assad) can do with impunity,â€ Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told a news conference. McConnell said Vice President Mike Pence had called him to explain the rationale for the strikes. It was one of a series of calls by administration officials to members of Congress beginning shortly before the strikes and extending until after midnight on Thursday evening. Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was called by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Trump himself. After seeing the devastation in Syria and visiting refugee camps, he said he became emotional when he heard the news. â€œWhen I talked to the president last night, I told him how proud I was of our country. And him,â€ Corker said. Democratic Senator Mark Warner, vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Trumpâ€™s Director of National Intelligence, Dan Coats, had called. â€œI am hopeful these strikes will convince the Assad regime that such actions should never be repeated,â€ Warner said in a statement. Partisan debate over how to deal with Syria has been bitter. In 2013, then-President Barack Obama ran into stiff resistance from many Republicans, including McConnell, when he proposed military action to retaliate for a chemical attack that crossed Obamaâ€™s red line. Many Democrats, some of whom had paid a political penalty for backing Republican President George W. Bushâ€™s war in Iraq, also opposed intervention. Obamaâ€™s abrupt decision not to fire missiles and instead work with Russia to remove Assadâ€™s chemical weapons infuriated many Republicans who had backed the Democratic presidentâ€™s proposal. The conflict in Syria has now dragged on for seven years, devastating the country, destabilizing the region and leaving millions homeless. Republican Senator Marco Rubio said he wanted a broader strategy. â€œI would love to have one yesterday, or the day before. Iâ€™d like to have one already but Iâ€™d rather them design it correctly than not,â€ he said, leaving a briefing by General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Most lawmakers insisted Trump should seek Congressâ€™ approval for any additional military action. â€œCongress must live up to its Constitutional responsibility to debate an Authorization of the Use of Military Force against a sovereign nation,â€ Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi wrote in a letter asking Speaker Paul Ryan to call the House of Representatives back to Washington to debate a formal authorization to use military force. The House is not due to return until late April. Republican Senator Rand Paul, a member of the foreign relations committee, called the Syria strikes illegal. Under the U.S. Constitution, declarations of war require congressional approval. â€œWeâ€™ve had no chance to weigh or weigh in on whether we should do it or not,â€ Paul told reporters. Democratic Senator Chris Murphy, another committee member, said that if Congress does not assert itself now, it risked losing its constitutional right to declare war. â€œI think itâ€™s devastating to the future role of Congress in foreign affairs. If we donâ€™t authorize this action, I donâ€™t see why any president would ever come to Congress,â€ Murphy said. ",Real
" Fox Host LOSES IT, Expertly Rips Trumpâ€™s â€˜Buy Americanâ€™ Policy APART (VIDEO) While most of America can see right through to the flaws of Donald Trump s policies, it s always a special moment when someone from Fox News recognizes it.Earlier today, Fox host Shep Smith tore Trump s latest executive order apart, noting that it could actually ruin America s economy instead of help it. Smith, who has been a vocal critic on Trump before, expertly pointed out that Trump s announcement of a  Buy American and Hire American  order will actually cause the cost of goods in America to skyrocket.Trump s new plan will review the H-1B visa program for foreign workers; a program that many massive companies use. Pointing out that the program serves a purpose, Smith explained: Tech giants including Amazon, Apple, Google, and others all hire thousands and thousand of using it. Even automakers, including Ford and GM, use this program to find engineers. Executives for those companies argue they can t always find enough American workers with the skills needed for the specific jobs. They also claim the program encourages students to stay in the United States after school. Then, Smith went after Trump by pointing out that even the POTUS himself doesn t buy or hire American when it comes to his own businesses: But the White House says the companies take advantage of those visas, that they bring in large numbers of foreign workers pay them less, and drive down wages. President Trump himself has gone back and forth over this program. And as for the president s push to  buy American,  opponents point out the obvious, that some of the president s own products were made from workers from about a dozen other companies. And besides  the price of everything at your Walmart and your local store and everywhere else goes way up for you. Smith is exactly right and brilliant for exposing Trump s own hypocrisy, and for explaining to conservatives that the man they elected is not going to help America like they thought he would.You can watch Smith take down Trump below:Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images",Fake

So seeing as how the Golden Globes are put on every year by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, it s safe to say the Golden Globe Awards is not their favorite at all.And during his acceptance speech, Hugh Laurie absolutely torched Trump and the Republican Party. Thank you first to the Hollywood Foreign Press Association for this amazing honor,  Lauire began.  I suppose it s made more amazing by the fact that I ll be able to say I won this at the last ever Golden Globes. I don t mean to be gloomy, it s just that it has the words Hollywood, Foreign and Press in the title. To some Republicans, even the word  association  is slightly sketchy I accept this award on behalf of psychopathic billionaires everywhere. Here s the video via YouTube:As previously mentioned, Meryl Streep and Viola Davis also delivered blistering messages to Trump. But so far, Trump has only thrown a temper tantrum over Streep s speech, calling her  overrated  and a  Hillary flunky  on Twitter. Seriously.Many conservatives are whining about the Golden Globes, claiming that it s inappropriate to deliver political speech at an awards show.

" Trump Ignores Constitution, Suggests INSANE Punishment For Burning American Flag (TWEETS) Donald Trump has been going off on his infamous psychotic Twitter rants again, and they just keep getting more and more terrifying as the days go on.On Tuesday morning, Trump suggested that Americans who burn the American flag should lose their citizenship or alternatively be forced to spend a year in jail: Nobody should be allowed to burn the American flag   if they do, there must be consequences   perhaps loss of citizenship or a year in jail! TwitterThis is yet another instance where Trump has displayed how little he knows about how the actual Constitution works. Burning the American flag is completely legal, unlike what Trump is suggesting. Trump s proposed punishment for flag burning also goes against the landmark 1989 Supreme Court case Texas v. Johnson, where burning the flag was protected under the First Amendment. It should also be noted that one of Trump s idols, the late Justice Antonin Scalia, ruled in favor of that case.Revoking citizenship is a very serious concept to play with. According to the Huffington Post, an American citizen can only lose their nationality by pledging allegiance to another country, committing treason, or voluntarily giving it up .Anand Giridharadas didn t hesitate to call Trump out, bringing attention to the fact that Trump is more of a fascist than anything else. He summed up Trump s threat perfectly when he said  the explicit articulation that doing legal things could cost you citizenship. TwitterThen, Giridharadas gave us some historical context:TwitterThat s terrifying, and unfortunately it s only the tip of the iceberg. Trump s flag burning tweet came after he went on a troubling Twitter rant last night, in which he attacked the free press for debunking his voter fraud lies. When you put all of Trump s threats together, it becomes clear that he s more interested in being a dictator than a President.Featured image via Maddie McGarvey /Getty Images",Fake
"Trump administration defends travel ban in Supreme Court brief NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Donald Trumpâ€™s administration reiterated arguments defending its temporary travel ban in a filing with the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday, repeatedly citing the executiveâ€™s broad powers to exclude foreigners from the United States. The travel ban barring refugees and people from six Muslim-majority nations was signed as an executive order in March, after an earlier version had to be scrapped in the face of legal challenges. Two federal appeals courts blocked the revised order from taking effect until the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June it could move forward on a limited basis. The nationâ€™s highest court has agreed to hear oral arguments about the lawfulness of the ban on Oct. 10, and the brief laid out the legal position the government plans to make. The state of Hawaii and refugee organizations challenging the executive order claim it is discriminatory against Muslims, citing statements Trump made on the campaign trail calling for â€œa total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.â€ However, the government, hammering against a broad ruling by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that blocked the ban, said campaign statements made by the president when he was a private citizen should not be taken into account. The brief said it was a mistake to probe the presidentâ€™s motives in decisions about national security, which would amount to inappropriate â€œjudicial psychoanalysisâ€ of the president. Trump said the order was necessary to review vetting procedures to help protect the country from terrorist attacks.  The Department of Justice argued the case would â€œinvite impermissible intrusion on privileged internal Executive Branch deliberationsâ€ and that the plaintiffs in the case were calling for â€œup to 30 depositions of White House staff and Cabinet-level officials.â€ The government repeated its stance that Congress has granted the president wide authority to limit refugee admissions and bar the entry of any foreigner or group of foreigners if it would be â€œdetrimental to the interests of the United States.â€  The Supreme Court ruled parts of the revised March executive order could go into effect on June 29, finding that anyone from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen with a â€œbona fide relationshipâ€ to a U.S. citizen or entity could not be barred. However, the government excluded grandparents and other family members from the definition of who would be allowed in, leading to another round of legal sparring. Eventually the Supreme Court said that, while litigation continues over enforcement of the ban in lower courts, grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, and siblings-in-law of people from the six countries would be let in but that refugees with relationships with U.S. resettlement agencies would not.  Attorney Neal Katyal, who is representing Hawaii in its challenge to the ban, said in an email on Thursday: â€œWe look forward to the Supreme Court hearing our case in October.â€ ",Real
"U.S. senators seek ban on pesticide chlorpyrifos  (This version of the July 25 story corrects paragraph 11 to show that bill calls for banning chlorpyrifos and reviewing other similar pesticides, not reviewing effects of chlorpyrifos) By Emily Flitter NEW YORK (Reuters) - A group of Democratic senators hopes to ban a pesticide the U.S. government has greenlighted for use, according to a bill unveiled on Tuesday in a challenge to Republican President Donald Trumpâ€™s push to loosen environmental regulations.  The bill, introduced by Senator Tom Udall of New Mexico, would outlaw chlorpyrifos, an agricultural insect-killer that has been found to cause brain damage in children. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency denied a petition to ban the chemical on March 29, and a federal appeals court on July 18 denied a petition by green groups to force the agency to reverse its decision and enact the ban. The bill is called the Protect Children, Farmers and Farmworkers from Nerve Agent Pesticides Act of 2017. Seven other senators are co-sponsoring it: Ben Cardin of Maryland, Kamala Harris of California, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Richard Durbin of Illinois and Ed Markey of Massachusetts.  Chlorpyrifos, produced by a variety of manufacturers, including a subsidiary of Dow Chemical, is listed as a neurotoxin by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Preventionâ€™s Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. â€œCurrent regulatory safety standard for chlorpyrifos rests on five decades of experience in use, health surveillance of manufacturing workers and applicators, and more than 4,000 studies and reports examining the product in terms of health, safety and the environment,â€ a Dow spokesman said on Tuesday. â€œAuthorized uses of chlorpyrifos products, when used as directed, offer wide margins of protection for human health and safety.â€   The EPA considered whether to ban it for roughly a decade before Trump appointed EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, a Republican from Oklahoma, to lead the agency. In denying the petition to ban chlorpyrifos, Pruitt said the EPA had previously relied on â€œnovel and uncertainâ€ scientific study methods to conclude the substance was dangerous. The agency said it was still reviewing the chemicalâ€™s registration.  â€œEPA will continue to evaluate the potential risks posed by chlorpyrifos as part of the ongoing registration review,â€ said EPA spokeswoman Amy Graham. Trump and Pruitt have vowed to roll back environmental regulations they say are harming business growth in the United States.  Philip Landrigan, a pediatrician who is dean for global health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, said three long-term, independently funded studies showed the substance was toxic. â€œChlorpyrifos has been shown beyond any shadow of a doubt to damage the brains of children, especially those of fetuses in the womb,â€ he said. Udallâ€™s bill also calls for the EPA to conduct a broad review of the use of other pesticides similar to chlorpyrifos to determine which groups are most vulnerable to their harmful effects. If the review shows any people are being exposed to harmful levels of the chemicals, called organophosphates, the EPA administrator must take â€œappropriate regulatory actionâ€ within three months by either suspending or revoking the their registration or lowering the amount that can legally be used.  â€œCongress must act because Administrator Pruitt has shown that he wonâ€™t,â€ Udall said in a statement on Monday.

"Trump says Comey not telling truth, willing to respond under oath WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday denied he tried to interfere with an FBI investigation, effectively accusing James Comey, the FBIâ€™s former director, of lying under oath to Congress. Comey delivered scathing remarks about the president on Thursday at a congressional hearing and testified that Trump had asked him to drop a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe into former aide Michael Flynn and his alleged ties to Russia.  Trump said Comeyâ€™s testimony also vindicated him from allegations that he colluded with Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. â€œJames Comey confirmed a lot of what I said. And some of the things that he said just werenâ€™t true,â€ Trump said at a news conference in the White House Rose Garden. Asked by a reporter if he had told Comey to drop the investigation into former national security adviser Flynn, Trump said, â€œI didnâ€™t say that.â€ The reporter then asked, â€œSo he lied about that?â€ â€œWell, I didnâ€™t say that. I mean, I will tell you, I didnâ€™t say that,â€ Trump replied. â€œAnd there would be nothing wrong if I did say it according to everybody that Iâ€™ve read today, but I did not say that,â€ he said. In his testimony, Comey also said Trump asked him in January to pledge loyalty to the president, an unusual request that would put in doubt the independence of the FBI.  â€œI hardly know the man. Iâ€™m not going to say I want you to pledge allegiance. Who would do that?â€ Trump said. Comeyâ€™s testimony was the most eagerly anticipated U.S. congressional hearing in years. The issue of the Trump election campaignâ€™s relationship with Russia has dogged Trumpâ€™s first months in office and distracted from his policy goals such as overhauling the U.S. healthcare system and making tax cuts. Comey, who was fired by Trump in May, did not make any major disclosures about any links between Trump or his associates and alleged Russian meddling. Asked on Friday if he would be willing to go under oath to give his version of his interactions with Comey, Trump replied, â€œ100 percent.â€ He said he would be happy to speak to special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating allegations that Russia interfered with the election and colluded with Trumpâ€™s campaign. â€œI would be glad to tell him exactly what I just told you,â€ Trump told a reporter. Several congressional committees, as well as the FBI and Mueller, are looking into the Russia allegations. On Friday, the leaders of the House of Representatives intelligence committeeâ€™s investigation said they had asked Comey for his notes and memos about his discussions with Trump, and asked the White House to produce any recordings or memos of conversations between Trump and Comey. Trump declined to answer questions from reporters about whether recordings existed. â€œIâ€™ll tell you about that maybe sometime in the very near future,â€ he said. Trumpâ€™s offer to testify under oath would pit his word against Comeyâ€™s before federal investigators. If either Trumpâ€™s testimony or memos written by Comey about his conversations with the president turn out to be untrue, either man could be charged with lying to federal investigators. A U.S. president is given a wide array of immunities from criminal prosecutions. The U.S. Constitution does not directly address whether the president can be criminally prosecuted, and the area is the subject of legal debate. A president can be charged after leaving office. Trump wrote earlier on Friday on Twitter that the former FBI head had vindicated him by telling the Senate Intelligence Committee that the president had not been personally under investigation in the Russia probe. With a single tweet, Trump also castigated Comey as â€œa leakerâ€ for giving an account of his conversation with the president to a law professor who shared it with a news outlet. â€œDespite so many false statements and lies, total and complete vindication ... and WOW, Comey is a leaker!â€ Trump tweeted.

"Some middle-class Americans worry Trump health subsidies cut will hurt  PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Tom Westerman voted for Donald Trump in last yearâ€™s election but says he might not do so again after the president cut off billions of dollars in Obamacare subsidies to health insurance companies.  â€œIt really upset me,â€ said Westerman, 63, a self-described â€œmiddle-class guyâ€ with an annual household income of about $60,000 in the western Pennsylvania city of Arnold.  Westermanâ€™s change of heart reflects mounting fears among middle-class Democrats and Republicans that their health insurance costs will soar as Trump weakens former President Barack Obamaâ€™s signature healthcare law, which extended insurance to more than 20 million Americans.  Trump said last week he would stop paying the monthly subsidies, which he has derided as a bailout of insurers. The money reimburses insurers for discounts on deductibles, copays and other out-of-pocket costs the firms still must provide under Obamacare to low-income households.  Some insurers, anticipating that Trump would end the funding, had already raised 2018 premiums on insurance plans under Obamaâ€™s Affordable Care Act to recoup those funds. Others withdrew from Obamacare markets in many states because of the uncertainty.  â€œIt seems like he is trying to hurt the middle class,â€ said Westerman, who is retired from a manufacturing company in Pennsylvania, a state that Trump won by little more than 44,000 votes over Democrat Hillary Clinton. It was the first time a Republican candidate had won Pennsylvania since 1988.  Westerman already pays $520 a month in healthcare premiums and about $700 a month for his 21-year-old daughterâ€™s college tuition. â€œHe says heâ€™s going to make it better for everyone. How does a (premium) increase make it better?â€  A White House spokesman declined to comment and referred inquiries to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Trump has called subsidy payments a â€œgiftâ€ for insurance companies. His administration has argued that it cannot lawfully make the payments unless Congress passes new legislation.  Some people said they were encouraged to see Trump deliver on a campaign promise to dismantle Obamacare, after repeated failures by congressional Republicans to repeal the 2010 law.  â€œI support the president because I think Obamacare is imploding and it not only impacts those on Obamacare, but everybody,â€ said Roger Heuring, 58, who lives in New Jersey. Heuring is on an employer plan but said his sister in Ohio buys insurance on the Obamacare market.  â€œForget the president â€“ itâ€™s the Congressâ€™s responsibility. Theyâ€™re the ones that passed this mess to begin with,â€ Heuring said.  In addition to cutting subsidies, Trump signed an executive order last week that could eventually make it easier for Americans to buy cheaper, bare-bones health insurance plans than required by Obamacare.  On Tuesday, two senators struck a bipartisan deal to stabilize the Obamacare market, including reinstating the subsidies for two years. Trump initially said he might back the deal, but reversed course on Wednesday, as senior Republican lawmakers spoke out against a plan that might allow Obamacare to survive.  Meanwhile, Democratic attorneys-general have asked a California judge to intervene and direct the administration to continue the payments until their legal challenge to Trumpâ€™s cutoff is settled in court.  The moves created new uncertainty over the subsidies, just two weeks before Americans begin to enroll in Obamacare plans for 2018.  MIDDLE-CLASS SQUEEZE  If the subsidies are not restored, some middle-income families and small business owners who buy insurance on the Obamacare markets could see their premiums rise the most, said Larry Levitt, health economist at the Kaiser Family Foundation.  These include cash-strapped self-employed workers who rely on Obamacare to buy insurance but make too much money to qualify for government assistance. The very poor receive other forms of government subsidies to buy coverage that shields them from premium increases.  Karyn Feit, a self-employed mental health therapist in Philadelphia, said a hike in premiums will strain her already-stretched finances and force her to cut back on trips to Florida to care for sick parents.  Feit, 47, and her husband together earn $100,000 annually, placing her among Americaâ€™s vast tier of middle-income families. They bought Obamacare individual coverage four years ago, when Feit left her job at a hospital to start her own business, leaving her without employer coverage. She has no children.  Her current monthly premiums are $391. She expects this to rise by $80 a month after Trumpâ€™s decision.  â€œThe first thing I would have to cut is travel, and caring for other people,â€ said Feit, a Democrat.  Trump voter Stephen Lewis, 62, lost his job as a veterinarian in Wisconsin and bought a health insurance plan under Obamacare. Lewis still supports Trump although he said he fears that his premiums, now $309 a month, could rise further with the subsidy cut, making it harder for him to meet other expenses, including $611 in monthly mortgage payments.  â€œIt is a concern obviously,â€ Lewis said.

" Arizonaâ€™s Largest Newspaper Breaks 125 Year Tradition, Backs Democrat For President Since 1890, The Arizona Republic, now the state s largest and most popular newspaper, has seen over 30 presidential elections. And every time, they have endorsed the Republican contender   Eisenhower, Nixon, Goldwater, Ford, Reagan, H.W. Bush, Dole, Bush, McCain, and Romney.This year, something changed dramatically for the editorial board   they put country over party, and endorsed Hillary Clinton, the Democrat, over Donald Trump, the Republican.Once again, Hillary has broken a glass ceiling.Writing that Hillary Clinton is the only candidate who can lead America forward, the editorial board did not mince words with their hatred for Donald Trump.  The 2016 Republican candidate is not conservative and he is not qualified,  the board writes just after pointing out that they have a deep admiration for conservative principles.The board also pointed out that Hillary is by no means a conservative (rather a centrist), but in the grand scheme of things, Trump s bombastic, offensive, divisive and racial language is contrary to what America stands for, and this against what they argue to be real conservatism:Trump s conversion to conservatism is recent and unconvincing. There is no guarantee he will name solid conservatives to the Supreme Court  Trump s inability to control himself or be controlled by others represents a real threat to our national security. His recent efforts to stay on script are not reassuring. They are phony.Ouch. Not only is Trump a faux conservative in their eyes, he s a con man who s trying to lie his way into the presidency. Luckily, the Arizona Republic sees right through his xenophobic nonsense.While chiding Trump for his bromance with Russia and complete lack of world knowledge and foreign diplomacy, the paper highlights Hillary s ability to take a composed and headstrong approach to the issues facing America abroad:Clinton has argued America s case before friendly and unfriendly foreign leaders with tenacity, diplomacy and skill. She earned respect by knowing the issues, the history and the facts. She is intimately familiar with the challenges we face in our relations with Russia, China, the Middle East, North Korea and elsewhere. She ll stand by our friends and she s not afraid to confront our enemies.Quite possibly the biggest factor in the Republic s decision was Trump s treatment of Mexico and the hardworking, honest people that live there and the immigrants that  enrich  Arizona culturally, economically and diplomatically.When you I aunt Mexico and its people, you insult Arizona and its people.Trump is learning the hard way that words have consequences, and that decent people and decent entities will stand up to his bully pulpit.That is why the Arizona Republic put people over party and made the right decision.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",Fake
"Exclusive: Trump to approve Keystone XL at meeting with TransCanada CEO - official (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will announce the approval of the Keystone XL oil pipeline at the White House on Friday, alongside the chief executive officer of builder TransCanada Corp, according to a senior administration official. The pipeline linking Canadian oil sands to U.S. refiners had been blocked by former President Barack Obama, who said the pipeline would do nothing to reduce fuel prices for U.S. motorists and would contribute emissions linked to global warming. Trump signed an executive order to advance the project soon after taking office in January, saying it would create thousands of jobs. The administration official said that among those scheduled to be at the White House for the 10:15 a.m. EDT announcement are TransCanada Chief Executive Russell Girling and Sean McGarvey, president of North Americaâ€™s Building Trades Unions. Expedited approval of projects is part of Trumpâ€™s approach for a 10-year, $1 trillion infrastructure package he promised on the campaign trail. The White House is looking for ways to speed up approvals and permits for infrastructure projects, which can sometimes take years to go through the maze of regulatory requirements. â€œIt does fit into the overall strategy the president has for infrastructure,â€ the official said. The multibillion-dollar Keystone pipeline would bring more than 800,000 barrels per day of heavy crude from Canadaâ€™s oil sands in Alberta into Nebraska, linking to an existing pipeline network feeding U.S. refineries and ports along the Gulf of Mexico.  Approvals are still needed from state regulators, and the pipeline could face legal challenges. Conservatives have said they support quick approval. Nick Loris, an energy and environment researcher at the Heritage Foundation, said on Thursday that approval would â€œre-establish some certainty and sanity to a permitting process that was hijacked by political pandering.â€ Environmental groups that have opposed the pipeline have said they will continue the fight with petitions, political pressure and mass protests.

"Federal spending plan reimburses New York City for Trump security NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal spending agreement reached late on Sunday will reimburse New York City for money spent securing U.S. President Donald Trump and his family at Trump Tower in Manhattan. Altogether, New York City and other state and local governments that have hosted the president would receive $61 million in the latest federal budget deal. Officials in Floridaâ€™s Palm Beach County, home to Trumpâ€™s private club Mar-a-Lago, have also asked for help in paying security costs. â€œWe are getting what we are owed,â€ Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement on Monday. â€œThatâ€™s good news for our city and the hardworking police officers faced with this unprecedented security challenge.â€ He and Police Commissioner James Oâ€™Neill worked for several months with New Yorkâ€™s congressional delegation to have the funds included in the deal, he said. Congress is expected to approve the legislation by the end of the week. The deal includes $20 million for costs incurred between Election Day in November and Inauguration Day in January, as well as $41 million after Trump was sworn in. The funding, which must be shared with other local governments, is on top of the $7 million allocated last fall.     The city spends on average $127,000 to $146,000 a day for the New York Police Department to protect First Lady Melania Trump and the coupleâ€™s young son when President Trump is not in town. Those costs are expected to swell to a daily average of $308,000 when Trump is in the city, the mayorâ€™s office said. Their home atop the 58-story skyscraper on Fifth Avenue near Central Park is the site of regular protests and is in an area popular with tourists. When outlining his $84.9 billion executive city budget for fiscal 2018 on Wednesday, de Blasio said the city normally handles occasional visits from Presidents, but not ongoing costs to keep the First Family secure in Trump Tower. â€œWeâ€™re not budgeting for something thatâ€™s a federal responsibility,â€ he said, according to a transcript of his remarks. â€œIt is ridiculous to expect local law enforcement... to bear the extraordinary and ongoing costs of protecting the President of the United States,â€ Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney, who helped lead the stateâ€™s congressional delegation in making the reimbursement request, said in a statement on Monday.

There was just one major problem   Trump blew it off.The Trump campaign had hyped up this event so much, and even organized it to be located right across the street from the White House   put Donnie wasn t there. He bailed, and decided to play golf instead. So much for being a dedicated POTUS and showing his dwindling number of supporters that he appreciates them, as his approval ratings continue to plummet to historic lows.The White House Press Pool told PoliticusUSA: After an uneventful ride along highways and byways toward Sterling, Virginia, motorcade pulled up to the Trump National Golf Club at 10:42 a.m.Motorcade split off and pool is now holding in a spectacular clubhouse overlooking indoor tennis courts. If any of Trump s supporters still think Trump cared about and appreciated them, this is a pretty rude awakening. When Trump s campaign announced the rally, it certainly sounded like Trump would actually be present. However, the event invitation was a little more cryptic. It said: As you know, the President has been under siege from the mainstream media and the Democrats, especially now that he put American jobs first by withdrawing from the Paris Accord. Therefore, we are organizing a group to demonstrate our support for President Trump and his fearless leadership. Either way, these Trump supporters expected Trump to be there, and he wasn t because he was playing golf   his main hobby when he wants to avoid doing his job. Trump must know that his presidency is doomed, because blowing off a rally full of supporters when his popularity is suffering is a bold move. To make matters worse, this rally couldn t have been more convenient   it was just across the street! And yet, Trump couldn t be bothered.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images",Fake
" Drunk Bragging Trump Staffer Started Russian Collusion Investigation House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes is going to have a bad day. He s been under the assumption, like many of us, that the Christopher Steele-dossier was what prompted the Russia investigation so he s been lashing out at the Department of Justice and the FBI in order to protect Trump. As it happens, the dossier is not what started the investigation, according to documents obtained by the New York Times.Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos was drunk in a wine bar when he revealed knowledge of Russian opposition research on Hillary Clinton.On top of that, Papadopoulos wasn t just a covfefe boy for Trump, as his administration has alleged. He had a much larger role, but none so damning as being a drunken fool in a wine bar. Coffee boys  don t help to arrange a New York meeting between Trump and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt two months before the election. It was known before that the former aide set up meetings with world leaders for Trump, but team Trump ran with him being merely a coffee boy.In May 2016, Papadopoulos revealed to Australian diplomat Alexander Downer that Russian officials were shopping around possible dirt on then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Exactly how much Mr. Papadopoulos said that night at the Kensington Wine Rooms with the Australian, Alexander Downer, is unclear,  the report states.  But two months later, when leaked Democratic emails began appearing online, Australian officials passed the information about Mr. Papadopoulos to their American counterparts, according to four current and former American and foreign officials with direct knowledge of the Australians  role. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. and is now a cooperating witness with Special Counsel Robert Mueller s team.This isn t a presidency.

" MAJOR Ad Vendor Bans Breitbart For Hate Speech, Trump LIVID You know how Donald Trump has been trying to convince us that Steve Bannon is a great guy and his publication, Breitbart, is just a news website that isn t a haven for white supremacists, white nationalists, and a diverse array of racists, bigots, and people who are fine with racism? Well, that s going to be just a teensy bit harder now after the publication was banned by an ad vendor for hate speech. Breitbart is just a publication,  Trump said in a recent interview with the New York Times.  They are certainly a much more conservative paper, to put it mildly, than the New York Times. But Breitbart really is a news organization that has become quite successful. It s got readers, and it does cover subjects on the right, but it covers subjects on the left also. It s a pretty big thing. There s no question that Breitbart is a  big thing,  but that s not exactly a good thing when it s something that Bannon himself described Breitbart as the  platform for the alt-right,  a term used to describe white supremacists who took a day off of abusing methamphetamines to throw on a suit and complain about the plight of white people in a seemingly legitimate setting. Nevertheless, Trump says he would never have hired Bannon had he any indicator (like an admission from Bannon that he runs a large platform for white supremacists) that he was alt-right: I ve known Steve Bannon a long time. If I thought he was a racist, or alt-right   I wouldn t even think about hiring him. The Donald says that he intends to get to the bottom of what is energizing the extreme Right (him) and find out why (because he appeals to racists).Trump s decision to appoint a white nationalist to a high-level position spurred AppNexus, a major advertising technology provider, to look into what sort of operation Bannon had birthed   and they didn t like what they found:AppNexus Inc., a major advertising technology provider, has barred Breitbart News from using its ad-serving tools because the conservative online publisher violated its hate speech rules.AppNexus scrutinized Breitbart s website after U.S. President-Elect Donald Trump tapped Steve Bannon, former executive chairman of Breitbart, to be White House chief strategist last week. The digital ad firm decided the publication had breached a policy against content that incites violence, said AppNexus spokesman Joshua Zeitz. We did a human audit of Breitbart and determined there were enough articles and headlines that cross that line, using either coded or overt language,  he said.Bloomberg notes that while Breitbart does not buy ads from AppNexus directly, the ban means that they will not receive ads from the ad server the company runs and this will likely lower the price of ads on the site   which means less money for the modern day Neo-Nazis.Will more advertising companies follow suit? Only time will tell   but the pressure is certainly on!Featured image via Getty Images (Ben Jackson)",Fake
"U.S. lawmakers reach deal on Russia sanctions bill, creating limits for Trump WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republicans and Democrats have reached agreement on legislation that allows new sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea, leading congressional Democrats said on Saturday, in a bill that would limit any potential effort by President Donald Trump to try to lift sanctions against Moscow.      The Countering Iranâ€™s Destabilizing Activities Act, which was passed by the Senate a month ago, was held up in the House of Representatives after Republicans proposed including North Korea sanctions in the bill. The House is set to vote on Tuesday on a package of bills on sanctions covering Russia, Iran and North Korea, according to House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthyâ€™s office. The measure will â€œhold them accountable for their dangerous actions,â€ McCarthy said in a statement Saturday. Under the proposed bill, Trump must submit to Congress a report on proposed actions that would â€œsignificantly alterâ€ U.S. foreign policy in connection with Russia, including easing sanctions or returning diplomatic properties in Maryland and New York that former President Barack Obama ordered vacated in December. Congress would have at least 30 days to hold hearings and then vote to uphold or reject Trumpâ€™s proposed changes. Many lawmakers hope the bill will send a message to Trump to keep a strong line against Russia.  Trump, who met Putin at the Group of 20 summit in Hamburg earlier this month and said it was an â€œhonorâ€ to meet him, has been criticized for seeking to reset U.S.-Russian relations. His administration has been bogged down by ongoing investigations of possible ties between his 2016 campaign and Russia. With the bill, Republicans and Democrats are seeking to punish Russia for its 2014 annexation of Crimea, a peninsula belong to Ukraine, and for meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Putin has denied any meddling in the U.S. democratic process last year. Trump has said that his campaign did not collude with Russia. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said Russiaâ€™s â€œoutrageous and unacceptableâ€ behavior in the 2016 U.S. election and in Europe â€œdemand that we have strong statutory sanctions enacted as soon as possible.â€ Even so, she expressed concerns that by including North Korea the legislation could face procedural delays in the Senate. Senior Republican lawmakers did not immediately comment on the latest bill. In Brussels, the European Union sounded an alarm about the U.S. moves to step up sanctions on Russia, urging Washington to coordinate with its Group of 7 partners.  The European Commission, the EUâ€™s executive body, warned of possibly â€œwide and indiscriminateâ€ â€œunintended consequences,â€ notably on the EUâ€™s efforts to diversify energy sources away from Russia. McCarthy and Ed Royce, chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement the revised bill helps â€œbolster the energy security of our European allies by maintaining their access to key energy resources outside of Russia.â€ Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said a strong sanctions bill â€œis essential,â€ and said in a statement that he expects â€œthe House and Senate will act on this legislation promptly, on a broad bipartisan basis.â€ Senator Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the agreement was reached after â€œintense negotiations.â€ â€œA nearly united Congress is poised to send President Putin a clear message on behalf of the American people and our allies, and we need President Trump to help us deliver that message,â€ he said in a statement.

Cernovich is a major troll on Twitter and he s also promoted the insane Pizzagate conspiracy theory in which he and other right-wing nutbags allege that Hillary Clinton and John Podesta run a child slave ring in the basement of Comet Ping Pong in Washington, D.C. Oh, by the way, I ve been there and there is no basement in the pizzeria.And then there was the time a comedian made fun of Cernovich on Twitter, so the conspiracy theorist Snowflake retaliated by suggesting that he was a child molester. In a now-deleted tweet, Cernovich wrote,  Have you guys ever tried  raping  a girl without using force? Try it. It s basically impossible. Date rape does not exist.  He also says that black women should be slut-shamed so they won t get AIDS. He s that kind of a guy. He s part of the  Alt-Right  (cough, cough, neo-nazis).Cernovich also circulated the conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton has Parkinson s while offering no evidence to back that up.

"Trump's firm sought Moscow real estate deal during presidential run: Washington Post WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trumpâ€™s company was pursuing a Moscow real estate deal while he was running for U.S. president in late 2015 and early 2016, the Washington Post reported on Sunday. The Post report cited people familiar with the proposal and records viewed by Trump Organization lawyers. The newspaper said investors and Trumpâ€™s company had signed a letter of intent to build a Trump Tower in Moscow but the project, lacking land and permits, was abandoned at the end of January 2016, just before the U.S. presidential primaries began, according to several people familiar with the proposal. The White House initially referred Reutersâ€™ queries to White House special counsel Ty Cobb and later to the Trump Organization. Neither responded immediately to a request for comment. The Washington Post report comes amid investigations by an independent special counsel and congressional committees into whether Trump campaign aides colluded with Moscow to influence the 2016 U.S. election. Trump and the Russian government have denied any collusion. In July 2016, Trump denied business connections with Russia and said on Twitter: â€œfor the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia.â€ He told a news conference the next day: â€œI have nothing to do with Russia.â€ Discussions about the Moscow project began in earnest in September 2015, the Washington Post said, citing people briefed on the deal. An unidentified investor planned to build the project and, under a licensing agreement, put Trumpâ€™s name on it. However, it was unclear how involved or aware Trump was of his companyâ€™s negotiations, the newspaper reported. Before the project was dropped, a Russian-born real estate developer had urged Trump to visit Moscow to promote the proposal and suggested he could get Russian President Vladimir Putin to say â€œgreat thingsâ€ about Trump, according to the report, which cited people briefed on the correspondence. Trump, who was elected in November 2016, never went to Moscow, the newspaper said. Details about the proposed deal were contained in a batch of emails to be turned over to congressional investigators shortly, the report said. ",Real
"U.S. Republican Graham curious on Trump business deals WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said on Tuesday he wants to know more about President Donald Trumpâ€™s business dealings in relation to Russia, but that congressional investigations may have to avoid the matter if they conflict with an FBI probe. Graham asked former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper at a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing on Monday whether he had concerns about Russian ties to Trumpâ€™s business interests. Clapper said he could not comment because the issue could be a subject of an ongoing investigation. CNN reported on Tuesday that Graham intended to look into Trumpâ€™s business ties to see if any connections exist between Russia and the Trump campaign or the presidentâ€™s associates. The White House said it would welcome any fact-finding by Graham and the subcommittee, which he chairs, saying the president has no business ties to Russia. â€œHe has no business in Russia; he has no connections to Russia,â€ White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters. â€œSo he welcomes that.â€ Spicer added that Trump had directed a law firm to send Graham a certified letter stating as much. While Graham expressed interest in finding out whether Trumpâ€™s business interests had any Russia ties, he said the subcommittee may have to â€œsteer clearâ€ of the issue if it conflicts with the FBIâ€™s probe of Russia and the Trump campaign. He clarified later that he had not taken any new actions. â€œThis is nothing new here,â€ he told reporters at the Capitol. â€œIâ€™m not a prosecutor. But if you ask me if I want to know if there are any Trump business ties to Russia that are inappropriate, the answer would be â€˜yes.â€™â€ Graham told CNN it would be helpful to see Trumpâ€™s tax records but that it was too soon to say whether he would be willing to subpoena them, the network said.

"Factbox: What's in tax bill from Trump, House Republicans? (Reuters) - Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday released details of a 429-page tax bill that calls for slashing taxes on corporations, along with many other changes affecting individuals, families and businesses. Based on publicly released documents and comments from Republican lawmakers, here are the billâ€™s main features, which are expected to change as the tax debate unfolds in weeks ahead.  * Permanently reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from a current statutory rate of 35 percent, a change that is in line with initial Republican proposals.  * Dramatically reshapes the tax system for U.S. multinational corporations. Worldwide taxation of their foreign profits would end. A territorial tax system exempting those foreign profits from the corporate tax would be imposed.  * Gives multinationals a tax break on $2.6 trillion in profits they have stashed offshore on a tax-exempt basis. The measure would require those profits to be brought into the United States, or repatriated, but not at the full 35-percent corporate tax rate that would normally be due. Instead, those profits would be taxed at only 12 percent for cash assets and 5 percent for illiquid assets. Repatriation tax due under the proposal would be payable over eight years. * Imposes a new 10-percent minimum tax on U.S. companiesâ€™ high-profit foreign units, calculated on a global basis, to discourage shifting profits abroad.  * Proposes a tax on foreign companies operating in the United States of up to 20 percent on payments made abroad from U.S. operations. Companies could lower those taxes by putting more operations in the U.S. tax system. * Repeals the 20 percent corporate alternative minimum tax.  â€˜PASS-THROUGHâ€™ BUSINESSES * Caps the maximum tax rate on small businesses and other non-corporate enterprises to 25 percent, down from the present maximum rate on â€œpass-throughâ€ income of 39.6 percent. * Sets standards for distinguishing between individual wage income and actual pass-through business income to prevent tax-avoidance abuse of the new, lower tax level. * Allows immediate and full expensing of capital investments by businesses. * Allows businesses to deduct interest costs up to 30 percent of taxable income. Exempts from this rule businesses with average gross receipts of $25 million or less. Certain public utilities and â€œreal property tradesâ€ are also exempted. * Preserves the research and development tax credit. * Phases out tax credits for solar, geothermal and wind power. * Consolidates three higher education tax credits into a single credit. * Ends tax-exempt bonds for professional sports stadiums. * Ends deductions for employee entertainment and recreation activities, as well as other fringe benefits. * Consolidates the number of tax brackets from seven to the following: zero tax on income up to $24,000; 12 percent up to $90,000; 25 percent up to $260,000; 35 percent up to $1 million; and 39.6 percent over $1 million. That top bracket is the same as the present level and was added to the bill after critics hammered Republicansâ€™ original proposal to cut the top rate. * Increases the standard deduction for taxpayers to $12,000 from $6,350 for individuals, and to $24,000 from $12,700 for married couples. * Repeals the $4,050 individual personal exemption. * Preserves the home mortgage interest deduction for existing mortgages, but reduces the amount of interest that taxpayers can deduct from their taxes on new mortgages, capping it at $500,000. The cap is now $1 million. * Caps the deduction for state and local property taxes at $10,000. Repeals the deduction for state and local income and sales taxes, a measure that hurts high-income tax states, such as New York, New Jersey and California. * Retains popular retirement savings programs including the 401(k) and IRA pension plans. * Expands the child tax credit to $1,600 from $1,000, and establishes a new $300 credit for each parent and non-child dependent. Also preserves the child and dependent care tax credit. * Preserves the earned income tax credit. * Preserves the deduction for charitable giving. * Changes higher education benefits, such as college tuition, with further details not immediately available. * Repeals the individual alternative minimum tax on high-income taxpayers. * Doubles the exemption from the estate tax on inherited assets and repeals the tax over six years. * Adds $1.51 trillion to the federal budget deficit over a decade. The deficit is now about $700 billion a year. The national debt now exceeds $20 trillion. ",Real
" BUSTED: Trumpâ€™s Senior WH Staff Have Email Accounts On A Private Server (DETAILS) When Donald Trump was a running for office, he and his conservative followers repeatedly called for  locking up  Hillary Clinton for handling government work with a private server while secretary of state. Hypocrisy, thy name is GOP. Newsweek is reporting that senior Trump administration staffers have active accounts on a Republican National Committee email system. Kellyanne Conway, Jared Kushner, Sean Spicer and Steve Bannon are among those who are using the system (rnchq.org)   the same one the George W. Bush administration was accused of using in order to evade transparency rules after claiming to have  lost  22 million emails.What they re doing is not illegal but it is ironic.But after then-candidate Donald Trump and the Republicans repeatedly called for  locking up  Hillary Clinton for handling government work with a private server while secretary of state, the new White House staff risks repeating the same mistake that dogged the Democrat s presidential campaign. They also face a security challenge: The RNC email system, according to U.S. intelligence, was hacked during the 2016 race.  They better be careful after making such a huge ruckus over the private email over at the State Department,  says former Bush administration lawyer Richard Painter.And by the way, Hillary Clinton s server use did not violate the law. Still yet, last July, an informal adviser to Donald Trump s presidential campaign called for Hillary Clinton s execution. Al Baldasaro said that Clinton  should be put in the firing line and shot for treason  because of her use of private email server.It s not known yet how the Trump staffers are using the RNC email addresses, however, if they are actively using them then they are subject to the  Disclosure Requirement For Official Business Conducted Using Electronic Messaging Accounts. If White House staffers have already used the RNC emails system for White House work, they must copy or forward those communications into the government system within 20 days.But wait, there s more!The New York Times is reporting that Trump is still using his  old, unsecured Android phone  to take calls and tweet despite  protests from some of his aides. Last night when Trump tweeted that he would send in the Feds  to Chicago, he was using his Android.

"For Trump, it was the lost art of the deal WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In the end, the Closer couldnâ€™t close the deal. For President Donald Trump, the collapse on Friday of his first legislative priority, a healthcare reform bill, was an embarrassing loss of face after he and his administration insisted up until the time of the vote by the U.S. House of Representatives that there was enough Republican support. It brings into question the neophyte presidentâ€™s ability to move big-ticket legislation through Congress. And for a celebrity businessman who brands himself a deal-maker and fixer, it casts doubt over his ability to deliver on his bold â€œdrain-the-swampâ€ promises to shake up Washington. The White House wants to advance, among other things, tax reform and a massive infrastructure package this year, but now it must address whether a change of approach is needed and whether congressional allies such as House Speaker Paul Ryan can be counted on to deliver. â€œThis is the most consequential day of Trumpâ€™s presidency and itâ€™s not just a failure, itâ€™s a stunning failure,â€ Charlie Sykes, an influential Wisconsin Republican political commentator and frequent Trump critic, said on Twitter.  Trump appeared to chalk up the loss in part to his own inexperience after House leaders pulled their bill to repeal and replace Obamacare following defections by both moderate and far-right Republican members who were unmoved by Trumpâ€™s ultimatum to vote for the plan or live with the current system. â€œWe learned a lot about loyalty. We learned a lot about the vote-getting process,â€ Trump said after the bill was withdrawn, adding that he would move forward with other priorities. It was yet another setback for an administration barely two months in office that has already seen its national security adviser resign, had its immigration restrictions struck down in courts, and faces a barrage of questions about the Trump campaignâ€™s ties to Russia. Trumpâ€™s hallmark salesmanship seemed to abandon him this week. Although he furiously courted the hard-line conservatives opposed to the reform bill, they largely refused to yield, and in the process he alienated moderates who initially supported the bill. The president then switched tactics and gave up trying to bring the conservative opponents into the fold, instead delivering an ultimatum that all Republicans needed to back the bill. That did not work either.  Trump also failed to persuade the American public that the bill was an improvement over the one it would have repealed and replaced: the Affordable Care Act - the signature domestic achievement of former Democratic President Barack Obama. Polls showed the replacement bill to be deeply unpopular, and conservative Republicans complained that their offices were being deluged by calls from constituents opposing it.  â€œThis demonstrates that campaigning and legislating are two different things,â€ said Jim Manley, once a top aide to former Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.  Representative Joe Barton of Texas blamed the failure on Republicans who control the White House, Senate and the House still learning how to govern after eight years of Obama.  â€œSometimes youâ€™re playing fantasy football and sometimes youâ€™re in the real game,â€ Barton told Reuters. Representative Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida called it â€œa big blowâ€ for the Republican agenda. Trumpâ€™s efforts to engage the billâ€™s opponents at times seemed to muddy the process further, as he largely cut Ryan out of negotiations. (Ryan didnâ€™t seem to mind, calling Trump a â€œgreat closer.â€)  But even as Trump offered concessions, conservatives did not budge and moderates were angered. Stuart Diamond, a professor who teaches negotiation at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, said Trumpâ€™s strong-arm tactics backfired.  â€œThreats donâ€™t work in general,â€ he said. â€œThey cause damage to relationships. They definitely donâ€™t work in a situation with a lot of different stakeholders, where the power is distributed.â€ After the bill was revised along Trumpâ€™s specifications, the Congressional Budget Office, which analyzes the financial impact of proposed legislation, determined that the bill would deprive 24 million Americans of health insurance over the next decade and slice about $150 billion off the budget deficit.  The CBO said the bill would not affect the number of uninsured but it would reduce the budget deficit significantly less than the original bill, troubling fiscal hawks. Even as Trump and the White House pushed harder, opposition to the bill among the rank and file rose. Representative Bill Huizenga, a Michigan Republican who is also a small-business owner, said Trump was still getting used to governing. â€œThere are parallels between government and business, but they are not exactly the same.â€ The lesson from the debacle, said John Feehery, a Republican strategist who was an aide to former House Speaker Dennis Hastert, is that the White House needs to take a firmer hand in crafting legislative strategy. On healthcare, Trump largely deferred to Ryanâ€™s office, which drafted the bill in secret, sowing mistrust among conservatives.  Congress now faces arguably an even tougher legislative reform: overhauling the tax code, which has not been done since 1986 and involves navigating a snake pit of competing special interests. Like Trumpâ€™s healthcare proposal, it could struggle against public opinion, with Democrats likely to cast it as a Republican giveaway to the rich. There was also a feeling among some Republicans that they had escaped a looming disaster. Even if the bill had passed the House, it faced a radical overhaul in the Senate, meaning both chambers would have been tied up battling over the bill for weeks, perhaps months. And if it became law and millions of voters lost health insurance, some Republicans feared they could suffer at the polls.  Instead, those Republicans have to hope voters will not punish them for failing to deliver on a promise they had been making since Obamacare was passed in 2010, and that they will  still believe this president when he says he can strike a deal. â€œThis is a promise the GOP made to voters. They need to get it right,â€ said Rachel Bovard, a policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, as she urged Republicans to â€œstart over.â€ It is unclear when that could happen. â€œThis bill is dead,â€ said Representative Greg Walden of Oregon, a member of the House leadership team.

" People Can Stop Giving Obama S*it About His Speaking Fee; Hereâ€™s What Heâ€™s Doing With It Our White House is currently occupied by someone who s likely certifiably insane, yet for many on both the right and the left, the real travesty is that Trump s predecessor is *gasp* earning a lot of money in speaking fees, just like just about every white male former president in the last 40 years.The news that former President Barack Obama will reportedly accept $400,000 to give a speech to Wall Street investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald has inspired a strange paroxysm of rage from writers on the center-left.  Obama s $400,000 Wall Street speaking fee will undermine everything he believes in,  Vox s Matt Yglesias proclaimed. Obama and Bill Clinton biographer David Maraniss said the 44th president  does not need the money and should not accept it.  Others noted the unseemliness of the fee at a time of income inequality and seemingly rampant populism, especially since Barack and Michelle Obama have already struck insanely lucrative book deals.Even Elizabeth Warren was  troubled  by Obama s speaking fees. Bernie Sanders called the fees  distasteful. Well, everyone can relax now. On Wednesday it was announced that the Obamas would be giving that amount and far more to help youth in Obama s adopted hometown of Chicago. One of the things that we ll be starting this year is Michelle and I are personally going to donate $2 million to our summer jobs programs here in the community,  he said at the South Shore Cultural Center.  [It s] so that right away young people can get to work and we can start providing opportunities to all of them. Obama is expected to use the center as he focuses on issues such as criminal justice reform and education for underprivileged children now that he has left office.

"Trump to sign executive order Tuesday on infrastructure projects WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump will sign an executive order on Tuesday â€œestablishing discipline and accountability in the environmental review and permitting process for infrastructure projects,â€ the White House said in a statement on Monday. Trump, who is visiting his residence at Trump Tower in New York City, will also participate in a discussion on infrastructure and give a statement on the subject at 3:45 p.m. (1945 GMT). The White House did not give additional details on the executive order. Trump, who was a real estate developer before becoming president, made rebuilding the countryâ€™s crumbling infrastructure a top campaign issue. He has proposed leveraging $200 billion in government spending into $1 trillion of projects to privatize the air traffic control system, strengthen rural infrastructure and repair bridges, roads and waterways. In June, Trump said one of the biggest obstacles to new infrastructure projects was â€œthe painfully slow, costly and time-consuming process for getting permits and approvals to build.â€ ",Real
" WATCH: Jake Tapper FLATTENS Trump Supporter For Citing Child Pimp As Witness Against Groping Claims Using a pimp for pedophiles as a witness is something only a sleazy and desperate lawyer would do.But former NYC mayor and Trump supporter Rudy Giuliani did it anyway during an appearance on CNN to defend Donald Trump against accusations of sexual assault and Jake Tapper was quick to burn him for it.From the start, it was clear that Giuliani is a hypocrite because while he absolutely believes the women who have accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct, he refuses to believe the women who have come forward to say the the Republican nominee sexually assaulted them. So far, nine women made such claims about Trump. But Giuliani thinks they are all liars. Do you believe every one of these women is lying?  Tapper asked. No, I believe my friend Donald Trump when he tells me he didn t do it,  Giuliani replied.  I ve never seen him do anything like that. Well, of course you haven t, Rudy. You ve only been kissing Trump s ass since April. Trump has been groping women for decades as a private citizen.Giuliani then conceded that he hasn t investigated the women s claims but he attacked Jessica Leeds in particularly by bringing up an alleged witness to the alleged groping on an airplane in the 1980s. There is an independent witness who says it s not true,  Giuliani declared triumphantly.But a disgusted Tapper crushed Giuliani s attempt to defend Trump by pointing out that Anthony Gilberthorpe was a self-claimed pimp for pedophiles who delivered underage boys to British politicians, hardly a credible witness and certainly not the kind of witness an attorney worth their salt would want on the stand.Tapper then cornered Giuliani about his support of the women who have accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct, noting that Donald Trump has paraded these women around and continues to talk about sexual assault even as his surrogates complain that the media hasn t moved on to covering something else.Hypocritically, instead of answering Tapper, Giuliani did just that and complained about the media and insisted that they move on from focusing on the sexual assault allegations against Trump. In fact, Giuliani was so desperate to stop talking about the sexual assault allegations that he rambled on and on for the remainder of the interview about other stuff Trump has talked about.Here s the video via YouTube:Donald Trump should have to answer for these allegations all the way through Election Day and so should his supporters. These are serious accusations that have a lot of credibility considering Trump has openly bragged about groping women whenever he wants even if they don t want him to do so.And Trump has only made things more difficult for himself by bringing in Bill Clinton s accusers and trash talking the women who have come forward against him.Republicans have also made this more of a story by continuing to support Trump despite his comments and behavior.So really, the only one Giuliani should blame for the media circus surrounding Trump is Trump himself.But again, that would require Giuliani taking his lips off of Trump s ass first.Featured Image: Screenshot",Fake
" Baltimore Teacher Breaks 7-Yr-Oldâ€™s Jaw For Being â€˜Disruptive,â€™ Throws Child Into Wall (VIDEO) An assistant elementary school teacher from Baltimore is facing abuse charges after he threw a 7-year-old boy into a wall, breaking his jaw, all because the child was being  disruptive. Lateekqua Jackson and Trayvon Grayson Sr. say their son, Trayvon Grayson, was assaulted by an assistant teacher at City Springs Elementary/Middle School on Monday. My son told me that [the teacher] threw my son into a wall,  Jackson explained.  My son had dreams about it all last night. He s still shaking in his sleep, saying that he keeps having visions of [the teacher] throwing him into a wall. Jackson said that her son s jaw was broken and two of his teeth were knocked out in the violent assault.Timothy Randall Korr, who is employed by the Baltimore Curriculum Project charter operation, has been identified as the child s abuser. Korr claims that the child was being  disruptive  and said he was taking the boy to the principal s office when the attack occurred, which he described as  a mistake. The teacher told me that he put him over his shoulder, and when he put him down he was bleeding,  Jackson recalled.  That s it. How can you tell somebody like that? He said he made a mistake. He said,  I made a mistake. It was a mistake.  That s what he said. Child abuse detectives got a warrant for Korr s arrest after watching the disturbing footage of the appalling incident that had been caught by a security camera. On Wednesday, the Baltimore Curriculum Project announced that Korr had been fired. We are heartsick that this child suffered this injury,  the group said in a statement.  We pray for his complete and quick recovery and for his family as well. Korr has been charged with 1st and 2nd-degree child abuse, 1st and 2nd-degree assault, reckless endangerment and neglect of a minor.Watch more on this sickening story here: Featured image via video screen capture",Fake

After the student leaves the room, the teacher does not stop screaming. As the she began to melt down, the students in the class started to laugh. This, of course did not go over well with their teacher, who informed them that they are  all getting zeroes for doing nothing.  Then she dropped the n-bomb: You re idiots. Do you wanna be a punk-ass n*gger who s going to get shot? You re stupid! Learn something, be a man.

There s no common ground to be found with Donald Trump, though, who the U2 singer called  potentially the worst idea that every happened to America. In an interview with CBS This Morning, Bono gave credence to the idea of American exceptionalism, but he feels that Trump destroys that.

But Donald Trump is potentially the worst idea that ever happened to America. Potentially.

That idea is bound up in justice and equality for all   equality and justice for all, you know,  he continued.  I think he s hijacked the party. I think he s trying to hijack the idea of America.

"Virginia officials postpone lottery drawing to decide tied statehouse election (Reuters) - A lottery drawing to settle a tied Virginia legislative race that could shift the statehouse balance of power has been indefinitely postponed, state election officials said on Tuesday, after the Democratic candidate mounted a legal fight. The decision to put off the high-stakes lotto, originally scheduled for Wednesday, marks the latest twist in a dramatic election recount that at one point showed Democrat Shelly Simonds beating Republican incumbent David Yancey by a single vote.  A victory by Simonds would shift Republicansâ€™ slim control of the 100-member House of Delegates to an even 50-50 split with the Democrats, forcing the two parties into a rare power-sharing arrangement. A day after Simonds emerged as the victor of a recount, a three-judge panel ruled that a disputed ballot should be counted for Yancey. That decision left the two candidates tied with 11,608 votes each in a district that encompasses the shipping hub of Newport News in southeastern Virginia, setting the stage for the equivalent of a coin toss to pick a final winner. Simonds asked a state court to reconsider on Tuesday, arguing that the disputed ballot was wrongly included. An image filed in court showed that the ballot had bubbles filled in beside both names, with a slash mark by Simondsâ€™ name. The voter selected Republicans for other offices. Simonds told reporters that the case had implications not only for her contest but for the integrity of state elections as a whole, saying that without a court ruling in her favor, â€œrecounts would become a never-ending spiral of courtroom challenges.â€ The chairman of the Virginia Board of Elections, James Alcorn, said in a statement that while holding a lottery would be in keeping with state law, such a move should be considered â€œan action of last resort.â€ He added: â€œAny substantive concerns regarding the election or recount should be resolved before a random drawing is conducted.â€    Yanceyâ€™s campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Virginia House Republican Caucus said in a statement that it was reviewing the new court filings. â€œWe believe the court acted appropriately and that the integrity of the process is without question,â€ spokesman Parker Slaybaugh said. Virginia Department of Elections spokeswoman Andrea Gaines said in an email that no new date for a drawing has been set. Democrats notched historic gains in Virginiaâ€™s statehouse elections last month, part of the partyâ€™s first big wave of political victories since Republican Donald Trump won the White House last year. Before the Nov. 7 general election, Virginia Republicans held 66 seats to the Democratsâ€™ 34 in the House of Delegates, along with a majority in the state Senate. ",Real
"New Jersey's Christie vetoes bill seeking Trump's tax returns (Reuters) - New Jersey Governor Chris Christie on Monday vetoed a bill that would have required President Donald Trump to release his tax returns in order to run for re-election in the state, calling it â€œpolitics at its worst.â€ The Democrat-controlled state legislature had passed the bill in March in response to Trumpâ€™s refusal to make public his tax returns when he ran for president as a Republican last year. Under the law, any candidate for president or vice president could not appear on the ballot without releasing at least five years of returns. Before Trump, every major presidential candidate had done so voluntarily since the 1970s. Christie, who became one of Trumpâ€™s earliest high-profile backers after his own White House run fizzled and served on Trumpâ€™s transition team, said the legislation was an unconstitutional â€œform of therapyâ€ for Democrats unwilling to accept Trumpâ€™s win over Democrat Hillary Clinton. â€œThe hypocrisy and false outrage underlying this bill is stunning - even by Trenton standards,â€ he said in a statement accompanying the veto. New Jersey was the first of at least 20 states considering similar legislation to send a bill to its governorâ€™s desk for consideration. The chairman of the state assemblyâ€™s judiciary committee, Democrat John McKeon, called Christieâ€™s comments â€œgrandstanding and childish rhetoric.â€ â€œThis much is clear â€“ Governor Christie is obsessed with protecting and showing allegiance to President Trump,â€ McKeon added in a statement. â€œSad!â€ The state Senate majority leader, Democrat Loretta Weinberg, said voters â€œdeserve to know what financial ties and interests candidates for the presidency and vice presidency have, including with other countries.â€ Trumpâ€™s critics have said his tax returns represent the only way to assess any potential conflicts of interest related to his sprawling business empire. Democrats have also suggested the returns could reveal politically damaging information, such as Trumpâ€™s possible use of loopholes to avoid paying income taxes. During the campaign, Trump said he would not release the returns because he was being audited, and the White House has made it clear he has no intention of doing so after winning the election. ",Real

" Trump Bans The Public From Calling The White House To Comment Or Protest In another attempt to stifle freedom of expression, President Trump and his administration have dismantled the White House switchboard comment operating system. Instead, callers will be told to take their complaints and comments to Facebook and other White House social media platforms.When called, the White House switchboard states: Thank you for calling the White House comments line. The comment line is currently closed but your comment is important to the President and we urge you to send us a comment online at www.WhiteHouse.gov/contact or send us a message through Facebook messenger. Trump really is becoming the social-media president.Since the end of the transition, when the lines were apparently shut off, the Trump administration has been purging the White House website off all things that generally resemble the Obama White House   and thus anything that has to do with equality and inclusion. So this is just another instance of curtailing the openness of the people s house.It seems that the 15 percent of American households without internet will not be able to have Trump hear their concerns, who promised to be a champion of all people and listen to their needs.There is no indication yet from the White House whether this is permanent or temporary, as the incoming administration settles into their positions.Still, there was no downtime for this crucial line of democracy when the Obama administration took over in 2009.Given the Trump administration s penchant for lying and ignoring the people, this should come as no surprise. However, it should worry the public if no future action is taken to address this. The people s house should be readily available at all times, in all fashions.It s only day three, and Donald Trump and his team are showing a brazen disregard for the little things that make us great. When studying authoritarians, one must look at how the littlest of things change before their eyes.This might be one of them   a White House that doesn t want to be bombarded with calls from an outraged public.Featured image by Ron Sachs via Getty Images",Fake
" Alt-Right â€˜Enemiesâ€™ List LEAKED: Fascists Use Petition To Steal Data And Harass Activists Last night Buzzfeed reported that a massive document full of the names and addresses of people who signed an anti-fascist petition was being actively circulated by members of the alt-right (read: white supremacists) for the purposes of stalking and harassment. Members of 4chan s notoriously disgusting /pol/ board were caught passing the information back and forth in a private chat server which has been infiltrated by reporters. The document contains information taken from the website Refusefascism.org who circulated the petition among its members after white supremacist Richard Spencer was knocked out during a television interview. The alt-right at large has a long history of attacking people who disagree with their white nationalist ideology. They ve been implicated in harassment campaigns, where the alt-righters flood an activist s workplace with calls and complaints in an attempt to get them fired.Emails between alt-righters discussing the targets of their harassment.Another common tactic is SWATting, where a false report is made to 9/11 in order to force a police SWAT team to raid an activist s home. 6.

An Alabama woman by the name of Angela Williams shared a graphic photo of her son, lying in a hospital bed with a beaten and fractured face, on Facebook. It needs to be shared far and wide, because this is unacceptable.It is unclear why Williams  son was in police custody or what sort of altercation resulted in his arrest, but when you see the photo you will realize that these details matter not. Cops are not supposed to beat and brutalize those in their custody. In the post you are about to see, Ms. Williams expresses her hope that the cops had their body cameras on while they were beating her son, but I think we all know that there will be some kind of convenient  malfunction  to explain away the lack of existence of dash or body camera footage of what was clearly a brutal beating. Hell, it could even be described as attempted murder. Something tells me that this young man will never be the same. Without further ado, here is what Troy, Alabama s finest decided was appropriate treatment of Angela Williams  son:No matter what the perceived crime of this young man might be, this is completely unacceptable.

" WATCH: Mark Cuban Informs Fox Host That Media Would Cover Trump Better If He Would Just Shut Up When a Fox News host tried to whine about the way the media has been covering Donald Trump, Mark Cuban dropped a truth bomb on him.Throughout this campaign, the Republican nominee has said increasingly more bombastic statements. In fact, Trump s rhetoric and behavior are totally unprecedented, which is why the media is covering him the way they do.But Trump has repeatedly complained about the media covering the things he has said and done, which is why he has been blaming them for his low poll numbers and is accusing them of rigging the election against him.And Fox host Howard Kurtz tried to push the Trump line on Sunday, only to be derailed by real billionaire Mark Cuban. The media coverage of Trump in the last couple of months has been overwhelmingly negative,  Kurtz whined. But Cuban was quick to point out that Donald Trump only has himself to blame for the way the media covers him. Well, that s of his own making, isn t it? If you re going to say the things that he says, and if you re going to make the flippant comments that he makes, you re going to get covered. I mean, all he had to do was shut up nine out of ten times and the coverage would be distinctly different. That s just not something he s capable of doing. Cuban is exactly right. Donald Trump did this to himself by simply opening his mouth and saying and doing things that he shouldn t. He just doesn t want to take responsibility for his words and behavior so he is making the media his scapegoat and his supporters believe him.When Kurtz complained that the media is hostile towards Trump, Cuban once again informed the Fox host Trump knew what he was getting into when he threw his hat into the presidential arena. Look, on the way up, he was happy to ride the train, right? He bragged about media coverage, he was excited about it, he loved the live coverage of the primaries and early on the presidential race. It s a two-edged sword, you know that. So if you re going to love it on the way up, you got to learn to deal with it. Here s the video via YouTube.Once again, Mark Cuban is spot on. Donald Trump has seen a lot of presidential elections in his lifetime so he should know that media coverage of presidential candidates is intense. And Howard Kurtz should know that the primary job of the media is to cover the candidates because that s what journalism is all about. It s not that the media s coverage of Trump is negative, it s that Trump has made himself and his campaign negative from the start and he has made no effort to tone it down.So if Trump wants the media to start covering him differently, he ll have to change first. And that probably won t happen any time soon.Featured Image: Screenshot",Fake
" Biographer Says Trump Might Not Actually Be A Billionaire: â€˜He Just Makes It Upâ€™ (VIDEO) Donald Trump s lies are catching up to him one by one, and the latest person to call him out is Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and biographer David Cay Johnston.Some of you may not know who Johnston is, but he is the author behind The Making of Donald Trump   so he knows quite a bit about who the erratic business mogul is and isn t. In a newly released video, Johnston claims that there is absolutely no proof that Trump is the billionaire he says he is   adding another layer of deceit and fraud to Trump s already horrendous track record.The clip was published by Business Insider, where Johnston goes through Trump s bragging claims and compares them to the actual data on the business mogul s court records and bank filings. For example, Johnston says that last year, Trump said his net worth was $8.7 billion, $10 billion, $11 billion and higher,  even though there was nothing going on in the economy that would suggest that kind of gyrations of net worth.  The truth is, Trump is lying though his teeth. Johnston said: The fact of the matter is that Donald Trump just makes it up. Johnston also brought up a court testimony where Trump said he uses his gut  feelings  and  emotional state  to determine his net worth. Johnston joked about how  nuts  it was, and imitated Trump s strategy: By the way, I m having a great day today. I think my net worth must be at least a billion dollars. Johnston has been trying to get America to believe that Trump s billionaire status was fake since 1990. During that time, a net worth statement by Trump s bankers said that the GOP nominee s net worth was actually negative $295 million.Johnston is still standing by the claim that Trump isn t as successful as he seems, and continues to insist that although Trump is well off, there is  no evidence that he is a billionaire.

" Historian: Trump And His Supporters Should Be Arrested For TREASON If They Refuse To Accept Defeat As Election Day continues to get closer on the calendar, some conservatives are already threatening to commit acts of violence if Hillary Clinton beats Donald Trump.In fact, conservatives, including Trump, have been laying the groundwork for months now to invalidate the election results in the event Donald Trump loses.The Republican nominee went to Pennsylvania in August and declared that the only way he can possibly lose Pennsylvania is if Hillary Clinton cheats to win the state. Ever since then, Trump s campaign and the Republicans that support him have been claiming that Clinton will somehow steak the election via election fraud, which suggests Trump and his conservative backers will refuse to gracefully accept defeat on Election Day and could go so far as to make threats and commit acts of violence in order to prevent Hillary from taking over as Commander-in-Chief.And such a move by conservatives would not only be unprecedented in the entire history of our nation, it would also be treason.Historian Dr. Ronald Feinman explained in an article published by History News Network that in all of our history, no losing presidential candidate has ever not accepted defeat in the wake of losing an election. There has never been a threat of a losing candidate refusing to accept the victory of his opponent, even in the midst of an oncoming Civil War, or in the midst of the Great Depression, or during the tensions of the Cold War years,  Feinman wrote.There is absolutely no excuse or justification for even a perceived possibility that Donald Trump might cause a major threat to civil order by encouraging his supporters to refuse to accept his defeat. Yet, we have some Republicans, including Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin seemingly setting the stage for possible civil disobedience and even violence based on the argument that Bill and Hillary Clinton are totally corrupt, and that no victory by Hillary Clinton would be valid. It is truly terrifying to think of the possible threat to the new President and Vice President by crazed supporters who use Trump s vehement opposition and potential rejection of the results as an excuse for bloodshed and violence, including a possible threat to the health, safety, and lives of Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine.During the Values Voter Summit last month, Bevin called for bloody rebellion if Hillary Clinton wins in November. Somebody asked me yesterday, I did an interview and they said,  Do you think it s possible, if Hillary Clinton were to win the election, do you think it s possible that we ll be able to survive? That we would ever be able to recover as a nation? And while there are people who have stood on this stage and said we would not, I would beg to differ. But I will tell you this: I do think it would be possible, but at what price? At what price? The roots of the tree of liberty are watered by what? The blood, of who? The tyrants to be sure, but who else? The patriots. Whose blood will be shed? It may be that of those in this room. It might be that of our children and grandchildren. I have nine children. It breaks my heart to think that it might be their blood that is needed to redeem something, to reclaim something, that we through our apathy and our indifference have given away. Donald Trump has also suggested that  Second Amendment people  could  do something  to stop Hillary Clinton.This suggests that Trump and conservatives are planning to contest any election result that is not in their favor and are planning to cause chaos and commit violence if they don t get their way. This should be seen as a treasonable act, were it to occur, requiring the arrest, trial and incarceration of any Trump supporters, including the candidate himself, who represent a threat to constitutional order and American democracy,  Feinman continued.  Donald Trump would go down in history ever worse than his reputation has already been sullied by his actions and statements promoting division and chaos in America, and undermining its ability to protect national security. Being a  sore loser  who advocates or endorses violence and bloodshed would put him into a class with people such as Benedict Arnold and Aaron Burr as traitors to the nation. Indeed, Trump and conservatives would be undermining our democracy and our tradition of peaceful transfers of political power which is why Americans must defeat Donald Trump by a landslide on November 8th in order to send a clear message to Trump and conservatives that their agenda is rejected and their behavior is totally unacceptable.Featured Image: Flickr",Fake
" Trump Just Literally Gave The WWE A Cabinet Position; World Doomed (DETAILS) Just when you thought things couldn t get crazier and more bizarre in the future Donald Trump administration, the president-elect just nominated ex-WWE CEO Linda McMahon to head the Small Business Administration, which is considered a cabinet role.According to Reuters: U.S. President-elect Donald Trump plans to nominate professional wrestling magnate and former Senate candidate Linda McMahon as his choice to head the Small Business Administration, transition officials told Reuters on Wednesday. Trump picks Linda McMahon to lead the Small Business Administration pic.twitter.com/sIWGV4MJsd  Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) December 7, 2016Reuters points out: McMahon, 68, is a co-founder and former CEO of the professional wrestling franchise WWE, which is based in Stamford, Connecticut. She ran unsuccessfully for a U.S. Senate seat in Connecticut in 2010. She was an early supporter of Trump s presidential campaign. Further: The SBA, which has at least one office in every U.S. state, provides support to small businesses such as extending loans and making sure they get a percentage of federal contracts. And nothing says  small business  like the WWE! It s likely one of the largest entertainment companies around, and Trump is likely giving her the position as a personal favor for all her years of support and friendship. In fact, McMahon donated $6 Million to Trump s presidential campaign. Talk about pay for play. Linda s contributions in August and September alone reportedly make up nearly one third of the money raised by Rebuilding America Now, The Donald s super PAC, making her one of the leading external donors for the Republican party during this election. This entire scenario is just mind-boggling and beyond obscene. It s almost as if Trump is going out of his way to be as horrible as possible. Between white supremacists and the WWE running this country, hopefully we make it until 2020 to make sure Trump gets voted out.In the mean time, we really need to focus on the 2018 midterms.Read more:Featured Photo by Bill Pugliano/Getty Images",Fake
"Hawaii enacts law committing to goals of Paris climate accord SEATTLE (Reuters) - Hawaii has become the first U.S. state to enact legislation to bring its environmental standards in line with the Paris climate accord, officials said on Wednesday, less than a week after President Donald Trump announced that the United States would withdraw from the global agreement.  Hawaii Governor David Ige signed a bill on Tuesday requiring state officials to plan a response to climate change that aligns the state with the standards and goals of the Paris pact, according to Scott Glenn, an environmental adviser to the governor. â€œPeople come to Hawaii to enjoy its environment,â€ Glenn said. â€œWhen climate change is threatening our reefs and threatening our weather ... then itâ€™s threatening our economy, too.â€ Although Hawaii already has strong environmental rules, the new law is the first to directly refer to the standards of the Paris agreement, said Glen Andersen, who tracks energy and climate issues at the National Conference of State Legislatures. Along with setting climate change as a priority for the state, the bill creates a state commission dedicated to studying climate change and putting out detailed plans for responding both to sea-level rise and climate change as a whole, with the stipulation that the plans align with the Paris agreement. Trump said on Thursday that the landmark 2015 climate agreement threatened millions of jobs and productivity, and that he would start a multi-year process to withdraw from the deal, which has been signed by almost every other nation on Earth. The governors of Washington, California and New York on the same day announced the creation of a â€œclimate allianceâ€ of states that would remain committed to the Paris goals. Ige joined the alliance on Friday. An overwhelming majority of scientists say human activity - including the burning of oil, gas and coal - is the main driver of rising global temperatures. Scientists at the University of Hawaii said in April that sea-level rise driven by global warming will cause flooding of low-lying areas in the state dozens of times per year by 2050, and increase the risk of dangerous interactions between tropical storms and seasonal high tides.

"Trump angers UK with truculent tweet to May after sharing far-right videos LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump sparked outrage in Britain on Thursday with a sharp rebuke of Prime Minister Theresa May on Twitter after she criticized him for retweeting British far-right anti-Islam videos.   As British politicians lined up to condemn Trump for sharing videos originally posted by a leader of a British far-right fringe group, Trump, in an unprecedented attack on one of Americaâ€™s closest allies, replied with an unrepentant message. â€œTheresa @theresamay, donâ€™t focus on me, focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom. We are doing just fine,â€ he tweeted. His truculent response caused anger in Britain, where there have been several major Islamist militant attacks this year, with one minister describing Trumpâ€™s tweets as â€œalarming and despairingâ€. Londonâ€™s Muslim mayor called for the withdrawal of an offer to him to make a state visit to Britain.  May, on a visit to Jordan, repeated her view, expressed earlier by her spokesman, that the U.S. leader was wrong for sharing anti-Muslim videos posted by Jayda Fransen, deputy leader of Britain First. But she did not directly respond to Trumpâ€™s rebuke.  â€œIâ€™m very clear that retweeting from Britain First was the wrong thing to do,â€ May told reporters in Jordan. She said the group was a â€œhateful organizationâ€ that sought to spread division and mistrust. â€œThe fact that we work together does not mean that weâ€™re afraid to say when we think the United States has got it wrong, and be very clear with them,â€ May said. She added that Britain had a long-term, enduring relationship with the United States. The British ambassador to the United States, Kim Darroch, said he had raised concerns with White House officials. â€œBritish people overwhelmingly reject the prejudiced rhetoric of the far right, which seek to divide communities & erode decency, tolerance & respect,â€ he wrote on Twitter. Fransen, who was convicted this month of abusing a Muslim woman and whose group wants to ban Islam, is facing further criminal charges of racially aggravated harassment. TRUMP AND MAY ONCE HAND-IN-HAND Islamist militants have carried out several major attacks in Britain this year that have killed a total of 36 people, including a bombing in Manchester and two attacks on bridges in London in which victims were rammed with vehicles and stabbed. Trump initially addressed his rebuke to a Twitter handle that was not Mayâ€™s, though he later retweeted to the British leaderâ€™s correct account. Always a pillar of Britainâ€™s foreign policy, the so-called â€œspecial relationshipâ€ with Washington has taken on added importance as Britain prepares to leave the European Union in 2019 and seeks new major trade deals.  Since Trump became president, May has gone out of her way to cultivate a good relationship with him. She was the first foreign leader to visit him after his inauguration in January, and they were filmed emerging from the White House holding hands. She later said Trump took her hand in a gentlemanly gesture as they walked down a ramp.  But she angered his many critics in Britain then by extending an invitation to make a state visit to Britain with all the pomp and pageantry it brings including a formal banquet with Queen Elizabeth. Londonâ€™s mayor, Sadiq Khan, said May should withdraw the offer of a state visit. â€œAfter this latest incident, it is increasingly clear that any official visit at all from President Trump to Britain would not be welcomed,â€ Khan, who has clashed on Twitter with Trump, said. British lawmakers held an urgent session to discuss Trumpâ€™s tweets, with parliamentarians from across the political divide united in condemnation. â€œBy sharing it (the videos), he is either a racist, incompetent or unthinking, or all three,â€ opposition Labour lawmaker Stephen Doughty said. Britainâ€™s Middle East minister Alistair Burt tweeted: â€œThe White House tweets are both alarming and despairing tonight. This is so not where the world needs to go.â€ Despite repeated calls from opposition lawmakers to cancel the state visit, Home Secretary (interior  minister) Amber Rudd said the invitation still stood although a timing had not been agreed.  Outside parliament, there was more harsh criticism from the likes of Brendan Cox, the husband of lawmaker Jo Cox who was murdered in 2016 by a far-right extremist and Justin Welby, the spiritual head of the Anglican Church.   The U.S. ambassador to London Woody Johnson wrote on Twitter he had relayed concerns to Washington. â€œThe U.S. & UK have a long history of speaking frankly with each other, as all close friends do,â€ he said. The videos shared by Trump purported to show a group of people who were Muslims beating a teenage boy to death, battering a boy on crutches and destroying a Christian statue. Reuters was unable to verify the videos. The Dutch embassy in Washington issued a Twitter comment on one of them, which Fransen had described as showing a â€œMuslim migrantâ€ beating up a boy.  â€œ@realDonald Trump Facts do matter. The perpetrator of the violent act in this video was born and raised in the Netherlands,â€ the embassy said. â€œHe received and completed his sentence under Dutch law.â€ Britain First, a little-known party on the periphery of UK politics, welcomed Trumpâ€™s retweeting of the videos to his 44 million followers, regarding it as an endorsement of their message.  â€œIâ€™m delighted,â€ said Fransen, whose own Twitter following increase by 50 percent in the wake of the furor to 78,000. She told Reuters Trumpâ€™s retweets showed the president shared her aim of raising awareness of â€œissues such as Islamâ€. The White House defended the retweets by the Republican president, who during the 2016 U.S. election campaign called for â€œa total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United Statesâ€, saying that he was raising security issues. It repeatedly refused to be drawn into the content of the videos or whether Trump was aware of the source of the tweets. â€œItâ€™s about ensuring that individuals who come into the United States donâ€™t pose a public safety or terrorism threat,â€ White House spokesman Raj Shah told reporters aboard Air Force One.

"Republican, Democratic senators seek answers in Wells auto scandal WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of U.S. senators from both parties on Wednesday turned up the heat on Wells Fargo Inc. over its latest scandal, in which hundreds of thousands of car-loan borrowers were charged each month without their knowledge for collision insurance, which many of them did not need. The Republican chairs of the committee and the subcommittee that would head any congressional investigations into insurance sales, Senators John Thune and Jerry Moran, along with those panelsâ€™ senior Democrats, Senators Bill Nelson and Richard Blumenthal, wrote to Wells CEO Timothy Sloan with questions about the scandal as basic as how many customers were affected. They also requested copies of the bankâ€™s internal report that first identified the problem. The group sent similar questions to Barry Karfunkel, CEO of National General Holdings Corporation, which provided the insurance. Last week Moran said he was seeking additional information from Wells about reports the bank charged 800,000 borrowers for insurance without their knowledge or consent, but did not give specifics. Many borrowers already had cheaper insurance with other companies. The letter asks Sloan when the bank, which paid $190 million in fines and penalties last year over creating phantom bank accounts, first learned about the insurance sales practices and also what steps it is taking to prevent a recurrence and to refund the erroneous charges to customers. The letters do not mention possible hearings or subpoenas, but the senators have the authority launch an investigation using both if they are not satisfied with responses to their letters. Wells and National have until Aug. 23 to answer the questions. The Wells letter shows senators are concerned with reports that thousands of borrowers fell into delinquency because they could not afford the premiums on top of their monthly payments and the possibility bank management pushed employees to sign customers up for insurance with incentives or special benefits.  Incentives are at the heart of last yearâ€™s scandal, where employees said they created accounts in customersâ€™ names or pushed account holders to buy additional products they did not need in order to meet high sales targets. The senators are also seeking information about possible commissions paid or revenues shared between Wells and National. Wells spokeswoman Jennifer Dunn said the bank is committed to addressing the lawmakersâ€™ concerns.  â€œCustomer harm is not acceptable at Wells Fargo,â€ she said. â€œWe are committed to fixing these mistakes and earning back trust.â€ ",Real

"Trump preparing orders to review trade deals, procurement: officials WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is preparing new executive orders to re-examine all 14 U.S. free trade agreements and review government procurement policies to aid American companies, two administration officials said. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Mexico and Canada will top the list of trade deals to be reviewed, which affect 20 countries from the Americas to Asia, the officials told Reuters. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the orders were still being developed. They said on Wednesday that the trade deal and procurement review orders were among several executive actions that the Trump administration is preparing on trade. The timing of the orders is unclear, but they could start to be rolled out next week, the officials said. Politico first reported the plan for the two orders, quoting a senior administration official as saying the trade orders would help shift the White House narrative â€œto a place where the president can really shine.â€ The fate of Trumpâ€™s first major legislative effort in Congress, a measure to replace the 2010 Obamacare health law, remains uncertain amid stiff opposition from conservative Republicans. The House of Representatives had to delay a vote on the bill on Thursday due to insufficient support for the legislation. The orders to review existing trade deals and public procurement policies would be largely symbolic, as the administration has already announced its intention to renegotiate NAFTA, with plans to formally notify Congress of its intention to launch talks in the coming weeks.  Early last month, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said, â€œWeâ€™re going to re-examine all the current trade deals, figure out if we can improve them.â€ The U.S. bilateral and multilateral trade deals cover these countries: Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Israel, Jordan, Mexico, Morocco, Nicaragua, Oman, Panama, Peru, Singapore and South Korea. Media representatives for the White House and the U.S. Trade Representativesâ€™ office declined to comment on any forthcoming executive orders.  Senator Orrin Hatch, the Utah Republican who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, said he would welcome orders to review trade deals if that means it accelerated negotiations on changing them. â€œI think weâ€™ve got to start moving,â€ Hatch told reporters on Wednesday. â€œIf he wants to do these unilaterally or bilaterally, heâ€™s got to get going on them.â€  Trumpâ€™s trade officials, including White House adviser Peter Navarro, and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, have long said that NAFTAâ€™s rules-of-origin provisions need to be tightened to exclude more components from outside the trading bloc. NAFTA requires cars and trucks to have only 62.5 percent North American content, providing significant opportunities for Asian manufacturers to provide parts. The procurement review would be in line with Trumpâ€™s â€œBuy American, Hire Americanâ€ campaign push and could win some allies among Democrats in Congress. These include Senators Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and Jeff Merkley of Oregon, who urged the White House in a recent letter to exclude U.S. government contracts from NAFTA and restrict waivers that allow more foreign companies to bid on public procurements. But news of the potential trade orders did not impress  Republican Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts of Kansas. â€œIâ€™m more interested in getting our trade representative passed on the Senate floor,â€ Roberts told reporters, referring to Robert Lighthizer, Trumpâ€™s choice for U.S. trade representative, whose nomination has been stalled in the Senate. Roberts also said he wanted to impress upon the White House the importance of trade deals to boost agricultural exports, including a glut of Kansas wheat, amid what he views as a preoccupation with manufactured exports in the administration.

"Trump says Japan would shoot North Korean missiles 'out of sky' if it bought U.S. weaponry TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that Japan would shoot North Korean missiles â€œout of the skyâ€ if it bought the U.S. weaponry needed for doing so, suggesting Tokyo take a stance it has avoided until now. North Korea is pursuing nuclear weapons and missile programs in defiance of U.N. Security Council sanctions and has made no secret of its plans to develop a missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland. It has fired two missiles over Japan. Trump, speaking after a summit with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, repeated his mantra the â€œera of strategic patienceâ€ with North Korea was over, and said the two countries were working to counter the â€œdangerous aggressionsâ€. Trump also pressed Japan to lower its trade deficit with the United States and buy more U.S. military hardware. â€œHe (Abe) will shoot them out of the sky when he completes the purchase of lots of additional military equipment from the United States,â€ Trump said, referring to the North Korean missiles. â€œThe prime minister is going to be purchasing massive amounts of military equipment, as he should. And we make the best military equipment by far.â€ Abe, for his part, said Tokyo would shoot down missiles â€œif necessaryâ€. Trump was replying to a question that was posed to Abe - namely how he would respond to a quote from Trump from a recent interview in which he said Japan was a â€œsamuraiâ€ nation and should have shot down the North Korean missiles. Japanâ€™s policy is that it would only shoot down a missile if it were falling on Japanese territory or if it were judged to pose an â€œexistential threatâ€ to Japan because it was aimed at a U.S. target. The U.S. president is on the second day of a 12-day Asian trip that is focusing on North Koreaâ€™s nuclear missile programs and trade. â€œMost importantly, weâ€™re working to counter the dangerous aggressions of the regime in North Korea,â€ Trump said, calling  Pyongyangâ€™s nuclear tests and recent launches of ballistic missiles over Japan â€œa threat to the civilized world and to international peace and stabilityâ€. â€œSome people said that my rhetoric is very strong. But look whatâ€™s happened with very weak rhetoric over the last 25 years. Look where we are right now,â€ he added. North Koreaâ€™s recent actions have raised the stakes in the most critical international challenge of Trumpâ€™s presidency. The U.S. leader, who will visit South Korea on the trip, has rattled some allies with his vow to â€œtotally destroyâ€ North Korea if it threatens the United States and with his dismissal of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as a â€œrocket manâ€ on a suicide mission. Abe, with whom Trump has bonded through multiple summits and phone calls, repeated at the same news conference that Japan backed Trumpâ€™s stance that â€œall optionsâ€ are on the table,  saying it was time to exert maximum pressure on North Korea and the two countries were â€œ100 percentâ€ together on the issue. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hua Chunying, in  response to Abeâ€™s comments, said that the North Korean â€œsituationâ€ was â€œalready extremely complex, sensitive and weakâ€. â€œWe hope that under the present circumstances, all sidesâ€™ words and actions can help reduce tensions and reestablish mutual trust and getting the North Korean nuclear issue back on the correct track of dialogue and negotiations,â€ she said. Trump said he was committed to achieving â€œfree, fair, and reciprocalâ€ trade and wants to work with Japan on this issue. â€œAmerica is also committed to improving our economic relationship with Japan,â€ Trump said. â€œAs president, Iâ€™m committed to achieving fair, free, and reciprocal trading relationship. We seek equal and reliable access for American exports to Japanâ€™s markets in order to eliminate our chronic trade imbalances and deficits with Japan.â€ Earlier, speaking to Japanese and U.S. business executives, Trump praised Japan for buying U.S. military hardware. But he added that â€œmany millions of cars are sold by Japan into the United States, whereas virtually no cars go from the United States into Japanâ€. Japan had a $69 billion trade surplus with the United States last year, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. The United States was Japanâ€™s second biggest trade partner after China, while Japan was the United Statesâ€™ fourth largest goods export market in 2016. Japanese officials have countered U.S. trade complaints by noting Tokyo accounts for a much smaller slice of the U.S. deficit than in the past, while Chinaâ€™s imbalance is bigger. In a second round of economic talks in Washington last month, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso, who doubles as deputy premier, failed to bridge differences on trade issues. The two sides are at odds over how to frame future trade talks, with Tokyo pushing back against U.S. calls to discuss a bilateral free trade agreement. Trump also said earlier that an Indo-Pacific trade framework would produce more in trade that the Trans-Pacific Partnership pact pushed by his predecessor but which he announced Washington would abandon soon after he took office. The 11 remaining nations in the TPP, to which Japanâ€™s Abe is firmly committed, are edging closer to sealing a comprehensive free trade pact without the United States. Trump met Emperor Akihito, exchanging a handshake and nodding, before his lunch and talks with Abe. He also met relatives of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korean agents decades ago to help train spies, calling the kidnappings a â€œtremendous disgraceâ€ and pledging to work with Abe to bring the victims â€œback to Japan where they want to beâ€. â€œI think it would be a tremendous signal if Kim Jong Un would send them back,â€ Trump said. â€œIf he would send them back, that would be the start of something, something very special.â€   Abe has made resolving the emotive abductions issue a keystone of his career. The families hope their talks with Trump - the third U.S. president they have met - will somehow contribute to a breakthrough, although experts say progress is unlikely. Abe also expressed his condolences for the victims of a gunman who massacred at least 26 worshippers at a church in Texas. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Trump had no plans to change the schedule for his 12-day Asian trip, which will also take him to Seoul, Beijing and Danang, Vietnam.

"White House looking at ethics rule to weaken special investigation: sources WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is exploring whether it can use an obscure ethics rule to undermine the special counsel investigation into ties between President Donald Trumpâ€™s campaign team and Russia, two people familiar with White House thinking said on Friday. Trump has said that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosensteinâ€™s hiring of former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel to lead the investigation â€œhurts our country terribly.â€  Within hours of Muellerâ€™s appointment on Wednesday, the White House began reviewing the Code of Federal Regulations, which restricts newly hired government lawyers from investigating their prior law firmâ€™s clients for one year after their hiring, the sources said.  An executive order signed by Trump in January extended that period to two years. Muellerâ€™s former law firm, WilmerHale, represents Trumpâ€™s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who met with a Russian bank executive in December, and the presidentâ€™s former campaign manager Paul Manafort, who is a subject of a federal investigation. Legal experts said the ethics rule can be waived by the Justice Department, which appointed Mueller. He did not represent Kushner or Manafort directly at his former law firm. If the department did not grant a waiver, Mueller would be barred from investigating Kushner or Manafort, and this could  greatly diminish the scope of the probe, experts said. The Justice Department is already reviewing Muellerâ€™s background as well as any potential conflicts of interest, said department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores. Even if the Justice Department granted a waiver, the White House would consider using the ethics rule to create doubt about Muellerâ€™s ability to do his job fairly, the sources said. Administration legal advisers have been asked to determine if there is a basis for this.  Under this strategy, the sources said the administration would raise the issue in press conferences and public statements. Moreover, the White House has not ruled out the possibility of using the rule to challenge Muellerâ€™s findings in court, should the investigation lead to prosecution.  But the administration is now mainly focused on placing a cloud over his reputation for independence, according to the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.      Kathleen Clark, a professor of legal ethics at Washington University School of Law, said the Justice Department can grant a waiver if concerns about bias are minimal.  She said subjects of the investigation could later argue that its results cannot be trusted, but she believes the argument would not stand up in court.   The White House did not respond to a request for comment on whether it is reviewing the ethics rule in order to undermine Muellerâ€™s credibility.  Muellerâ€™s former colleagues at WilmerHale, James Quarles and Aaron Zebley, are expected to join his investigation, according to a spokeswoman for the law firm. Neither Quarles nor Zebley represented Kushner or Manafort.  Mueller will now lead the ongoing Federal Bureau of Investigation probe into Trumpâ€™s associates and senior Russian officials.  Unlike Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel appointed by a three-judge panel to investigate Bill and Hillary Clintonâ€™s real estate holdings in the 1990s, Mueller depends on the Justice Department for funding and he reports to Rosenstein, who was appointed by Trump.  When he announced Muellerâ€™s appointment this week, Rosenstein said Mueller will have â€œall appropriate resources to conduct a thorough and complete investigation.â€ ",Real
" New Trump Advisor Wants Women To Have Rapistâ€™s Baby â€“ Even If It Kills Her (AUDIO) Donald Trump might try to tell American voters that he  cherishes  women, but his long, ongoing history of misogyny and oppressive policies prove that the exact opposite is true   and one of his latest moves has just verified this fact even more.The Republican nominee recently made anti-abortion Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of the Susan B. Anthony List, one of his top domestic policy advisors. Dannenfelser is going to champion Trump s new  pro-life coalition , which Trump just announced while also making several statements about all the misogynistic things he s going to do as President of the United States.While introducing his coalition, Trump also promised that he would get anti-abortion justices into the U.S. Supreme Court, nix funding to Planned Parenthood, promote the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act and make sure that federal funds couldn t go toward abortion.It should be noted that Dannenfelser was absolutely against Trump at first, and in the beginning of the year had begged Iowa voters to vote for anyone but the business mogul. However, once The Donald was nominated and demonstrated how extreme his views were, Dannenfelser was more than happy to make the pro-life case for Trump.  Without a doubt, she was probably tickled pink when Trump said that women should be  punished  for having abortions a few months ago.Dannenfelser s involvement in Trump s campaign should terrify women and anyone who cares about them   she not only holds some of the most extreme views on abortion and women s health, but opposes women getting abortions in case of rape and incest, as well as cases in which a woman s health is at risk in carrying out a pregnancy. Really, you can t get more anti-woman than forcing a woman to die or be constantly reminded of a traumatic, horrifying experience in order to carry out a pregnancy.Dannenfelser is also massively against Planned Parenthood, an organization that provides safe, accessible and affordable healthcare to millions of women. She even believes that the organization is  sexist  because it primarily focuses on women s health. In an interview, she said: I love men! What about men s health?

"U.S. spy agencies probe another flank in Russian hacking SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Russian hacking of the 2016 U.S. election included sophisticated targeting of state officials responsible for voter rolls and voting procedures, according to a top secret U.S. intelligence document that was leaked and published this week, revealing another potential method of attempted interference in the vote. The month-old National Security Agency document outlined activities including impersonating an election software vendor to send trick emails to more than 100 state election officials. Analysts at the NSA believed the hackers were working for the Russian militaryâ€™s General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate, or GRU, according to the document. The documentâ€™s publication on Monday by The Intercept, a news outlet that focuses on security issues, received particular attention because an intelligence contractor, Reality Leigh Winner, was charged the same day with leaking it. U.S. intelligence agencies have previously said the Kremlin tried to influence the election outcome in favor of Republican candidate Donald Trump through leaks during the campaign of hacked emails from Democratic Party officials, aimed at discrediting Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. The new revelations suggest that U.S. investigators are also still probing a more direct attempt to attack the election itself, and a federal official confirmed that is the case. However, there is no evidence that hackers were able to manipulate votes, or the vote tally. The document says at least one employee of the software vendor had an account compromised but does not cover whether any of the elections officials were also successfully compromised. If they did compromise the officials, hackers could have planted malicious software, then captured proof of the infection to suggest that there had been fraud on Clintonâ€™s behalf, had she won the Nov. 8 election, experts said. â€œIf your goal is to disrupt an election, you donâ€™t need to pick the winner or actually tamper with tally result,â€ said Matt Blaze, a University of Pennsylvania computer science professor who has written on the security of voting machines. Simply casting doubt on the legitimacy of the results could achieve the goals of a government-sponsored hacking campaign, he said.  U.S. intelligence officials had previously stated that Russian intelligence had won access to â€œmultipleâ€ election officials but had said that compromised machines were not involved with vote tallies. But they had not said how sophisticated and extensive the effort was or how it worked. Russian President Vladimir Putin has strongly denied Russian government involvement in election hacking, though he said last week that â€œpatrioticâ€ Russians could have been involved. Trump has denied any collusion. SPEAR-PHISHING ON ELECTIONS OFFICIALS The newly leaked NSA report said the hackers used so-called â€œspear-phishingâ€ techniques on election officials, trying to convince targets to click on links in emails that seemed to come from legitimate correspondents. The report describes just one phishing campaign, which hit state officials a week before the election, but does not give any locations or say if it was successful. Although there may have been many others, security experts said one coming so late in the game would be more likely to be about sowing chaos than  trying to alter vote counts.  The report did not say what the hackers were trying to accomplish, and any investigation of the computers of people who were targeted would be the jurisdiction of the FBI. An FBI spokeswoman declined to comment Tuesday, as did the office of the special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and the Russian government. The â€œbaitâ€ used in the spear-phishing campaign involved software for managing voter registration rolls. The hackers might have been considering deleting some records and forcing officials to turn legitimate voters away, said elections technology security expert Alex Halderman, of the University of Michigan. There were no wide reports of mass rejections of voters, so perhaps that plan was abandoned or proved too hard to execute, he said. It is also possible that the idea was to get onto the machines of officials who oversaw both registration and voting software. Elections are run by counties in the United States.  â€œDepending on the countyâ€™s configuration and security practices and what is separated from what, they could have access to potentially every aspect, from lists of registered voters, to voting  machines, to firmware on those machines, to the ballots that are presented, to the software that controls the final tally,â€ Blaze said. â€œThis is the holy grail of what an attacker would want to compromise.â€  Members of Congress said they hoped to learn more about the hacking attempts. â€œItâ€™s important that the American people understand that the Russian attempts to break into a number of our state voting processes - we talked about this in the fall - was broad-based,â€ Democrat Mark Warner, vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence committee, told reporters. â€œItâ€™s my hope in the coming days that we can get more information out about that.â€ ",Real

" WATCH: Trump Supporter Lynches Hillary Doll At Rally During Trumpâ€™s Appeal To Black Voters If Trump supporters seriously want black people to vote for the Republican nominee, they should leave their nooses at home.Because during a rally in North Carolina on Wednesday evening in which Donald Trump made another desperate appeal to black voters, one Trump supporter draped a rope around the neck of a Hillary Clinton doll and hung her in effigy above the crowd for all to see.Ginger Glover is a toy store owner, so getting her hands on a  Lyin  Hillary  doll was easy. But it was a terrible idea to promote lynching imagery in a state where black people suffered lynchings in the past.Glover claims that she was only trying to say that Hillary should be  incarcerated at the very least  and that hanging her in effigy was  just for effect. Here s the video via YouTube:From 1877 to 1950, approximately 100 African-Americans were lynched in the state of North Carolina.Hanging a political candidate in effigy is an act of violence or threatened violence that has no place in our elections.This incident is even scarier considering that many Trump supporters are openly threatening to assassinate Hillary Clinton or lead a violent overthrow of the federal government if Trump loses the election, threats that only get worse as Trump continues to claim that the election is rigged against him.Nevertheless, it s going to be damn near impossible for Donald Trump to attract black voters to his campaign, especially if his supporters are bringing nooses to rallies and threatening to hang Hillary.African-Americans are not going to appreciate that imagery and they will not vote for man who condones it.Featured Image: Screenshot",Fake

The overriding objective must be learning who if anyone in the United States collaborated with the Russians as well as who knew about it, what they knew and when they knew it.Who might that big fish be?

" While We Were Watching Comeyâ€™s Testimony, The House Quietly Sucker-Punched Our Economy The news of the day is the testimony that former FBI Director James Comey gave to the Senate Intelligence Committee this morning, along with Trump s lawyer s response in which there were all kinds of false allegations leveled at Comey. And while we were all swept up in that, the House was busy sucker-punching us. They held an important vote today on what to do with the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill that was passed in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008.They re ridiculously calling their new bill the CHOICE Act. It basically allows the banks to decide for themselves whether they continue to abide by Dodd-Frank or not. Because self-regulation, particularly of the financial sector, has always worked so well in the past.The CHOICE Act has a capital requirement that many banks say is still too high, but in light of what else this bill does, that s a minor complaint. The bill guts the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was created specifically as an oversight body to help rein in risky behavior on the part of the big banks.Paul Ryan calls it  a jobs bill for Main Street.  Oh, please, Mr. Speaker, you know we can see right through your baloney. Especially on this.While Ryan and many of his cohorts are cheering the CHOICE Act s passage, some of the more sane Republicans and most Democrats are slamming it for  paving the way back to economic damage of the same scale [as the financial crisis] or worse,  as Maxine Waters put it.Furthermore, a story on Fortune s website says that this bill would prohibit the CFPB from publishing the data it collects on complaints about banks and other financial services, such as credit reporting. That, in turn, makes it more difficult for consumers to make informed choices, and it also could potentially remove an avenue for filing complaints and actually getting results: Individuals can also file complaints to try to right a wrong, such as when a credit bureau refuses to fix an error on a credit score. Credit reporting bureaus are notorious for mistakes, with as many as one in five consumers potentially having an error in their credit file.Yet the three main credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian, and Trans Union) lack proper incentives to fix these errors, which is why it should come as no surprise that they are the three most complained about companies in the CFPB database. [Full disclosure: I once filed a complaint about an error in my credit file, which I had been unable to fix in direct contact with the company, but after I filed a report with CFPB it was quickly fixed.] We know that the GOP doesn t care one whit about creating jobs, helping people in general or protecting the economy. They just proved it, again, with this after proving it with their insipid Obamacare replacement. Fortunately, like the AHCA, this has little chance of even making it to the Senate floor for a vote.Featured image via Ty Wright/Getty Images",Fake

" WATCH: Morning Joe Hosts HORRIFIED By Trump Adviserâ€™s Ignorance Of Constitution Donald Trump tried out a new minion on Sunday in what resulted in an embarrassing and terrifying appearance on all the networks.Trump adviser Stephen Miller, who helped write Trump s apocalyptic and negative inaugural address and the executive order that banned travelers from seven countries from entering the United States, appeared on the Sunday shows to press the same theme over and over again.Miller claimed that the judicial branch has no authority to stand in the way of Trump s national security agenda and that Trump is always  100 percent correct. We do not have judicial supremacy in this country,  Miller said on Fox News Sunday.  We have three co-equal branches of government. It s true that we have three branches of government, but the Constitution clearly made the judicial branch responsible for interpreting the laws and deciding what is and what is not constitutional.Last week, the Ninth Circuit Court ruled against reinstating Trump s executive order, a blistering defeat for his administration.The ruling caused Republicans to make a bill splitting the Ninth Circuit Court a top priority as punishment. And now Trump and his team are trying to undermine the power of the judiciary in retaliation.And that why Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski expressed horror on Monday morning.The Morning Joe hosts could not believe how anti-Constitution Miller was and that Trump actually praised him for it. It s so much worse than I ever thought,  Scarborough said after both reacted to Miller s performance by saying,  Oh my God. Scarborough then proceeded to inform Miller that courts have every right to question what Trump does and gave him a quick lesson about the Constitution. They will be questioned by the court   it s called judicial review. Alexander Hamilton and James Madison wrote about it in the Federalist Papers, it was enshrined in Madison s Constitution. Indeed, Article 3 of the Constitution has been the bedrock of our nation s judiciary since America s founding.Article 3 states:The judicial power of the United States, shall be vested in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish  The judicial power shall extend to all cases, in law and equity, arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority; to all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls; to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; to controversies to which the United States shall be a party; to controversies between two or more states; between a state and citizens of another state; between citizens of different states; between citizens of the same state claiming lands under grants of different states, and between a state, or the citizens thereof, and foreign states, citizens or subjects.In short, the courts have the final say about what is constitutional and what is not. Trying to undermine the power of the judiciary is a violation of the Constitution.That was the worst performance out of anybody,  Scarborough continued.  That was horrendous, an embarrassment. Go back and read the constitution. The White House has got to stop embarrassing themselves by putting this guy out there.

" Watch: Trump Supporting Coal CEO Upset Trump Is Wiping Out â€˜Thousandsâ€™ Of Coal Mining Jobs While on the campaign trail, Donald Trump promised to revive the coal industry and after he took power, he signed an executive order rolling back a temporary ban on mining coal and a stream protection rule that was imposed by the Obama administration. Trump vowed to bring back thousands of mining jobs in struggling rural areas.  I made them this promise,  Trump said,  we will put our miners back to work.

This means that very capital-intensive, highly leveraged employers, like coal-mining companies, will be forced out of business, with tragic consequences for our families and for many regions of our country,  Murray said.

"U.S. military to accept transgender recruits on Monday: Pentagon WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Transgender people will be allowed for the first time to enlist in the U.S. military starting on Monday as ordered by federal courts, the Pentagon said on Friday, after President Donald Trumpâ€™s administration decided not to appeal rulings that blocked his transgender ban. Two federal appeals courts, one in Washington and one in Virginia, last week rejected the administrationâ€™s request to put on hold orders by lower court judges requiring the military to begin accepting transgender recruits on Jan. 1. A Justice Department official said the administration will not challenge those rulings. â€œThe Department of Defense has announced that it will be releasing an independent study of these issues in the coming weeks. So rather than litigate this interim appeal before that occurs, the administration has decided to wait for DODâ€™s study and will continue to defend the presidentâ€™s lawful authority in District Court in the meantime,â€ the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. In September, the Pentagon said it had created a panel of senior officials to study how to implement a directive by Trump to prohibit transgender individuals from serving. The Defense Department has until Feb. 21 to submit a plan to Trump. Lawyers representing currently-serving transgender service members and aspiring recruits said they had expected the administration to appeal the rulings to the conservative-majority Supreme Court, but were hoping that would not happen. Pentagon spokeswoman Heather Babb said in a statement: â€œAs mandated by court order, the Department of Defense is prepared to begin accessing transgender applicants for military service Jan. 1. All applicants must meet all accession standards.â€ Jennifer Levi, a lawyer with gay, lesbian and transgender advocacy group GLAD, called the decision not to appeal â€œgreat news.â€ â€œIâ€™m hoping it means the government has come to see that there is no way to justify a ban and that itâ€™s not good for the military or our country,â€ Levi said. Both GLAD and the American Civil Liberties Union represent plaintiffs in the lawsuits filed against the administration. In a move that appealed to his hard-line conservative supporters, Trump announced in July that he would prohibit transgender people from serving in the military, reversing Democratic President Barack Obamaâ€™s policy of accepting them. Trump said on Twitter at the time that the military â€œcannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.â€ Four federal judges - in Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Seattle and Riverside, California - have issued rulings blocking Trumpâ€™s ban while legal challenges to the Republican presidentâ€™s policy proceed. The judges said the ban would likely violate the right under the U.S. Constitution to equal protection under the law. The Pentagon on Dec. 8 issued guidelines to recruitment personnel in order to enlist transgender applicants by Jan. 1. The memo outlined medical requirements and specified how the applicantsâ€™ sex would be identified and even which undergarments they would wear. The Trump administration previously said in legal papers that the armed forces were not prepared to train thousands of personnel on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants and might have to accept â€œsome individuals who are not medically fit for service.â€ The Obama administration had set a deadline of July 1, 2017, to begin accepting transgender recruits. But Trumpâ€™s defense secretary, James Mattis, postponed that date to Jan. 1, 2018, which the presidentâ€™s ban then put off indefinitely. Trump has taken other steps aimed at rolling back transgender rights. In October, his administration said a federal law banning gender-based workplace discrimination does not protect transgender employees, reversing another Obama-era position. In February, Trump rescinded guidance issued by the Obama administration saying that public schools should allow transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity.

"Senate committee questions Trump's nuclear authority WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. Senate committee on Tuesday held the first congressional hearing in more than four decades on the presidentâ€™s authority to launch a nuclear strike, amid concern that tensions over North Koreaâ€™s weapons program could lead to war. Senator Bob Corker, Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, held the hearing as President Donald Trump wrapped up a 12-day trip to Asia largely dominated by concerns about Pyongyangâ€™s nuclear ambitions. Corker acknowledged that senators, including Democrats and Trumpâ€™s fellow Republicans, have raised questions about Trumpâ€™s authority to wage war, use nuclear weapons and enter into or end international agreements. Trump has traded insults and threats with North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un and used expressions like â€œfire and furyâ€ to hint that any use of lethal force against North Korea would be overwhelming. On Sunday, he again insulted Kim by calling him â€œshort and fat.â€ Corker himself warned last month that Trump might be putting the United States â€œon the path to World War Three.â€ But on Tuesday Corker said the hearing was not intended to target Trump. â€œThis is not specific to anybody,â€ he said. Democrats made clear they were concerned about Trump. â€œWe are concerned that the president of the United States is so unstable, is so volatile, has a decision-making process that is so quixotic, that he might order a nuclear weapons strike that is wildly out of step with U.S. national security interests,â€ Senator Chris Murphy said. During the hearing, retired General Robert Kehler, former commander of U.S. Strategic Command, said the military can refuse to follow what it considers an illegal order, even a nuclear one. But it was not clear after questions from committee members how that process would work. Some senators want legislation to alter the presidentâ€™s nuclear authority. Corker said he did not now support that idea. â€œI do not see a legislative solution today, but that doesnâ€™t mean that over the course of the next several months one might develop,â€ he told reporters after the hearing. Some senators seemed to bristle about the hearingâ€™s tone, warning against comments depicting Trump as unable to strongly retaliate for any attack. â€œEvery single word that has been uttered this morning at this hearing is going to be analyzed in Pyongyang,â€ said Republican Senator Jim Risch, who is in line to become chairman after Corker retires next year.

"Timeline: FBI Director Comey's year of controversy ends in firing WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trumpâ€™s firing of FBI Director James Comey followed a turbulent year for Comey in which he became embroiled in controversy over his handling of investigations involving both Trump and former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Here is a timeline of the events that preceded Comeyâ€™s firing and Trumpâ€™s reaction to them. Comey announced he had recommended no criminal charges filed against Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton for her handling of classified information while she was secretary of state but called her â€œextremely carelessâ€ for using a private email server. Trump responded to the news by tweeting that Comeyâ€™s decision was an example of a â€œrigged systemâ€ in the United States. â€œVery very unfair! As usual, bad judgment,â€ he tweeted. Less than two weeks before the Nov. 8 presidential election, Comey announced in a letter to Congress that the FBI had learned of the existence of emails that appeared to pertain to the Clinton investigation and they would be reviewed whether they contained classified information.  The abrupt decision to renew the investigation upset Democrats who believed the announcement would have an impact on voting trends on Election Day and harm Clintonâ€™s chances of victory. Campaigning in Michigan, Trump exulted at the news of a reopened probe into actions surrounding an opponent he had dubbed â€œCrooked Hillary.â€ â€œThat was so bad what happened originally, and it took guts for Director Comey to make the move that he made in light of the kind of opposition he had where theyâ€™re trying to protect her from criminal prosecution,â€ Trump said. Two days after his inauguration, Trump was at an event in the White House and saw Comey in the audience. He called out to him and Comey strode up and they warmly shook hands and briefly embraced.   â€œHeâ€™s become more famous than me,â€ Trump said with a chuckle. Trump fired his national security adviser, Michael Flynn, after only 24 days in office after it was disclosed that Flynn had misled Vice President Mike Pence about the contacts he had with Russian ambassador to the United States Sergei Kislyak. Comey, in testimony before the House Intelligence Committee, said the FBI had been investigating possible coordination between the Trump presidential campaign and Russia. Clinton told a Women for Women event in New York that the Comey announcement threw the election for Trump. â€œIf the election had been onÂ Oct. 27, I would be your president,â€ she said. Trump responded with a late-night series of tweets. â€œFBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds!â€ Trump tweeted. White House spokesman Sean Spicer was asked about Trumpâ€™s tweet about Comey. â€œThe president has confidence in the director,â€ Spicer told reporters. May 4, 2017 Comey, in testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, said it made him â€œmildly nauseousâ€ to think his announcement of the reopening of an investigation into Clintonâ€™s emails affected the 2016 presidential election, but he had no regrets and would make the same decision again.  In four hours of testimony Comey gave an impassioned defense of his decision to reopen the Clinton probe. May 8, 2017 ProPublica reported possible inaccuracies about Comeyâ€™s statements about Clinton aide Huma Abedin. It said the FBI was said to be preparing to correct the record but that the plan appeared to be on hold with the bureau undecided about what to do. MIDAFTERNOON, May 9, 2017 At his afternoon daily briefing White House spokesman Sean Spicer was asked whether Trump still had confidence in Comey. Unlike his statement from a week earlier when he said Trump had confidence in Comey, Spicer equivocated. â€œI donâ€™t want to start speaking on behalf of the president without speaking to him first,â€ Spicer said. ABOUT 5:30 PM, May 9, 2017 In a brief appearance in the White House press room, Spicer announced Trump had accepted the recommendation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to fire Comey. A letter provided to the news media from Rosenstein cited Comeyâ€™s handling of the Clinton probe. The New York Times reported Comey got the news while in Los Angeles where he had been addressing FBI employees there. When a TV in the background flashed the news, Comey at first thought it was a prank, but then got word he had been fired. At the FBI headquarters in Washington, Trump personal aide Keith Schiller was seen leaving the building. A White House official said he had delivered Trumpâ€™s letter announcing Comeyâ€™s dismissal.

"Analyst View: Democrat Jones wins Alabama U.S. Senate seat in blow to Trump NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democrat Doug Jones won a bitter fight for a U.S. Senate seat in deeply conservative Alabama on Tuesday, dealing a political blow to President Donald Trump in a race marked by sexual misconduct accusations against Republican candidate Roy Moore. KEY POINTS:    The stunning upset makes Jones the first Democrat elected to the U.S. Senate from Alabama in a quarter-century and will trim the Republicansâ€™ already narrow Senate majority to 51-49, opening the door for Democrats to possibly retake the chamber in next yearâ€™s congressional elections.     PETER CARDILLO, CHIEF MARKET ECONOMIST AT FIRST STANDARD FINANCIAL IN NEW YORK:  â€œIf anything it prompts Congress to get the tax bill signed before year end and they have another week. If they donâ€™t they do have a problem.â€ â€œFrom that perspective yesterdayâ€™s defeat is good news in terms of tax legislation. Theyâ€™re not going to risk tax reform because of the election. While itâ€™s a defeat itâ€™s actually a positive.â€ â€œIf the President doesnâ€™t sign legislation by year end we have a major problem. That would just speed up the process of a correction. Would it affect the economy, reverse the economic growth? Not in 2018, perhaps in 2019.â€ â€œIt was a defeat for the Republican Party and Mr. Trump but it also motivates the Republicans to get their act together and get a bill signed.â€ KEITH LERNER, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, SUNTRUST ADVISORY SERVICES IN ATLANTA, GA: â€œTax reform is still likely to go through. What happened overnight may present an obstacle to the GOP agenda in 2018, but thatâ€™s arguably less important than tax reform. Perhaps there will be some obstacles to infrastructure, entitlement reform. But from a market perspective, those werenâ€™t high-probability anyway. â€œThe high probability is (tax) gets through. The Republicans have tried to fast-track it before (Jones) gets seated, so itâ€™s unlikely his victory will change that. â€œWeâ€™ll have a short-term setback (if the tax bill doesnâ€™t pass), and it may cap the upside of the market since companies wonâ€™t be getting an earnings boost. But if thereâ€™s a pullback, I think it will be in the 5 to 10 percent range, as opposed to a bear market. â€œItâ€™s still early, but there looks certainly to be big changes in the midterm with the makeup of the House and Senate.  â€œAs long as the economy is on sound footing, gridlock in Washington is not necessarily a bad thing. Itâ€™s not necessarily preferable, but with the majority so slim as it is, itâ€™s more of a question, does the economy chug along? If the economy continues to move forward, itâ€™s less important.â€  GENNADIY GOLDBERG, INTEREST RATES STRATEGIST, TD SECURITIES, NEW YORK: â€œWe think one of the possible biggest impact is on the deficit. With the Jones win, it makes it more difficult to pass the tax-cut bill. â€œThis puts pressure on the Republicans to pass tax cuts before year-end. The question is can they do it? Are we going to see special provisions or deals to get it done. I think itâ€™s a â€˜get it doneâ€™ mentality. If not, it does bleed into early 2018. â€œIt lowers the odds of getting anything done in 2018.â€ Â  L. THOMAS BLOCK, FUNDSTRAT GLOBAL ADVISORS, WASHINGTON POLICY STRATEGY (from research note):  â€œBottom line is that the Alabama Senate race doesnâ€™t change the basic (Washington) DC headlines, first that tax bill should pass by Christmas, and that there are tough negotiations ahead to solve the budget issues and avoid a government shutdown.â€  MARC CHANDLER, GLOBAL HEAD OF CURRENCY STRATEGY, BROWN BROTHERS HARRIMAN (from research note): â€œ(The dollar) did slip to the low for the week against the yen, when it became clear that the Republicans were going to lose the Senate seat in Alabama. This reduced the Republican majority to one in the Senate. Owing the fissures in the party, this is putting at risk other parts of Trumpâ€™s agenda, which Treasury Secretary Mnuchin acknowledged earlier this week is necessary to achieve the kind of growth levels that the tax bill assumes.â€  U.S. stock futures and the dollar dipped on Wednesday, although equities turned around by the open and the S&P 500 Index was last up 0.2 percent.

" Trump National Security Pick Monica Crowleyâ€™s Book No Longer For Sale Over Plagiarism Conservative columnist Monica Crowley is set for a top role in Donald Trump s administration and it s just been revealed that she plagiarized a massive portion of her 2012 book, stealing from journalists, notable Republicans and even from Wikipedia. Who plagiarizes from Wikipedia, by the way? She even plagiarized from a statement made by Dick Cheney. Crowley plagiarized more than 50 times in her book  What the (Bleep) Just Happened,  according to an analysis. She literally had to plagiarize in order to be critical of President Obama in her book.We re pretty sure Crowley didn t plagiarize her tweet last year when she wrote,  I guess Putin is going to have to do it. RT  State Dept Won t Release Clinton Fdn Emails for 27 Months. Crowley was picked by the president-elect to serve as senior director of strategic communications for the National Security Council.On Tuesday, publisher HarperCollins said that it will stop selling Crowley s book after the investigation revealed the massive amount of plagiarism in it. The book, which has reached the end of its natural sales cycle, will no longer be offered for purchase until such time as the author has the opportunity to source and revise the material,  HarperCollins said.CNN Money reports:A request for comment from the Trump transition team was not immediately returned. A spokesperson for the Trump transition team told CNN s KFile Saturday when the initial report was published that they were standing by Crowley. HarperCollins one of the largest and most respected publishers in the world published her book which has become a national best-seller. Any attempt to discredit Monica is nothing more than a politically motivated attack that seeks to distract from the real issues facing this country,  the spokesperson said.It s not just her book. Yesterday, it was revealed that Crowley also  lifted, with little to no changes, from other scholarly works without proper attribution  in her PhD dissertation at Columbia University and the evidence is overwhelming.Last year, the right wing pundit tweeted out a picture suggesting that the existence of the Berlin Wall was a good thing.

"States refuse Trump commission request for U.S. voter data CHICAGO (Reuters) - A growing number of U.S. states refused on Friday to give votersâ€™ names, addresses and sensitive personal information to a commission created by President Donald Trump to investigate alleged voter fraud, saying the demand was unnecessary and violated privacy. â€œThis commission was formed to try to find basis for the lie that President Trump put forward that has no foundation,â€ Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes told Reuters in an interview.     Republican Trump has made unsubstantiated claims that millions of people voted illegally for his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. He established the panel by executive order in May despite evidence that voter fraud was  not widespread. Trumpâ€™s Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity sent a letter to all 50 states on Wednesday asking them to turn over voter information including names, the last four digits of social security numbers, addresses, birth dates, political affiliation, felony convictions and voting histories. The request from commission Vice Chairman Kris Kobach  caused a backlash in states including Virginia, Kentucky, California, New York and Massachusetts, where election officials said they would not provide all the data.  California Secretary of State Alex Padilla said on Thursday that handing over information would only serve to legitimize debunked claims of widespread voter fraud.  More than 20 states said they would not or could not provide some or all of the information requested, according to statements from election officials and media reports. Some said certain data such as social security numbers were not publicly available and that they would turn over only public information. Others raised privacy concerns or questioned the need to examine voter fraud. Mississippi Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann said in a statement that he had not seen the letter but would rebuff the commission. â€œThey can go jump in the Gulf of Mexico and Mississippi is a great state to launch from,â€ he said. Kobach, the secretary of state for Kansas, has been a high-profile advocate of tougher laws on immigration and voter identification. His office did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. Kobach was quoted in a Kansas City Star article as saying that his own state would not provide social security numbers at this time since they are not publicly available. Kobach did not rule out providing that information in the future.  In his letter, a copy of which was provided to Reuters by the Connecticut Secretary of Stateâ€™s office, Kobach also asked states for feedback on how to improve election integrity and for evidence of voter fraud and convictions of voter-related crimes since 2000. Civil rights groups and Democratic lawmakers have called the commission a tactic to suppress votes against Republicans.    â€œStates are right to balk at turning over massive reams of personal information in what clearly is a campaign to suppress the vote,â€ Dale Ho, director of the American Civil Liberties Union Voting Rights Project, said in a statement on Friday.          While the public availability of voter data varies by state, the request raises privacy concerns, said Richard Hasen, a University of California, Irvine, professor who studies election law. ",Real
" WATCH: Chuck Todd Puts The Screws To Mitch McConnell For Not Giving Merrick Garland A Chance Mitch McConnell is still making ridiculous excuses to justify what Senate Republicans did to Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland.When Antonin Scalia passed away in February 2016, his body was not even cold before Republicans declared that they would refuse to hold hearings to confirm any replacement chosen by President Obama.And so, when President Obama selected a centrist judge named Merrick Garland to be the next Supreme Court Justice, Republicans immediately refused to do their job as outlined by the Constitution.Republicans tried to excuse their behavior by claiming that Democrats would have done the same thing even though Democrats have never once refused to grant a nominee a confirmation hearing. Furthermore, Republicans claimed that no Supreme Court nominee has ever been approved by the Senate in an election year.McConnell made the same claim on Sunday after Chuck Todd grilled him in response to Republican insistence that Donald Trump s Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch be confirmed immediately. The tradition had been not to confirm vacancies in the middle of a presidential [election] year,  McConnell said.  You d have to go back 80 years to find the last time it happened. Everyone knew, including President Obama s former White House counsel, that if the shoe had been on the other foot, [Democrats] wouldn t have filled a Republican president s vacancy in the middle of a presidential election. Again, Democrats have never refused to hold a confirmation hearing for a Supreme Court nominee.Also, Mitch McConnell is ignorant of Senate history.As it turns out, there have been several election year confirmations of Supreme Court nominees and we don t have to go back 80 years to find one.In fact, the last one occurred only 29 years ago when the Senate confirmed Justice Anthony Kennedy in 1988 during Ronald Reagan s last year in office.It also happened in 1956 when Dwight Eisenhower nominated William Brennan. The Senate confirmed him despite it being an election year.In 1940, also an election year, Franklin Roosevelt nominated Frank Murphy to the Supreme Court and the Senate confirmed him.So contrary to what Mitch McConnell says, there is plenty of precedent in our history proving that the Senate has no such  tradition  of not confirming Supreme Court nominees during an election year.Todd challenged McConnell for not simply holding a confirmation hearing and giving Garland an up or down vote. Why not put him up for a vote?  Todd asked.  Any senator can have a rationale to not vote for a confirmation. Why not put Merrick Garland on the floor and if the rationale is,  You know what? Too close to an election,  then vote no? Look, we litigated that last year,  a flustered McConnell replied.  The American people decided that they wanted Donald Trump to make the nomination, not Hillary Clinton. Actually, the American people voted for Hillary Clinton. She won the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes.McConnell then claimed that there s  no rational reason  to not vote to confirm Gorsuch. But that s not true either. You see, by refusing to grant Garland a confirmation hearing, Republicans set a precedent and gave Democrats all the reasons they need to block Gorsuch at all costs.Plus, Gorsuch has a terrible record and he was nominated by Trump, which is all the more reason for Democrats to block him.If Senate Republicans had not acted like petulant children in response to Merrick Garland, perhaps Democrats would have been more open. But the way Republicans treated Garland was un-American and totally outrageous. They disgraced the Senate with their conduct and Democrats now have precedent to respond in kind.But McConnell balked when Todd challenged him to take up a resolution that says Supreme Court vacancies won t be filled during an election year. In short, McConnell knows that if a Republican had been president in 2016, Senate Republicans would have rushed any Supreme Court nomination through. Because in the end, Republicans are hypocrites.Here s the video via YouTube.There is no excuse for Democrats to not block Neil Gorsuch from becoming a Supreme Curt Justice. In fact, if Republicans somehow get him confirmed, Democrats should impeach him as soon as they take back control of the Senate. This Supreme Court seat rightfully belongs to Merrick Garland. He deserves a fair confirmation hearing before Republicans are ever able to nominate someone to the Supreme Court again. Until then, Republican nominees should be the same and worse than the way Republicans treated Merrick Garland.And Republicans only have themselves to blame.Featured Image: Screenshot",Fake
" WATCH: Republican Rep Thinks Poor Americans Can Afford Healthcare If They Donâ€™t Buy A Cell Phone Republicans are delusional if they really believe forgoing a new cell phone will allow poor people to afford healthcare.But that s exactly what Utah GOP Rep. Jason Chaffetz believes.On Monday, House Republicans passed a monstrous bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act which pretty much leaves 30 million Americans out in the cold without insurance. Republicans stripped subsidies away from low-income Americans and will give them to families who can actually afford to pay for healthcare without government aid. The bill also wipes out the Medicaid expansion that allowed millions more to obtain coverage. Furthermore, the bill kills the insurance mandate, which guaranteed that enough Americans would have health insurance that the insurance pool would be able to cover people with pre-existing conditions. The bill also makes senior citizens pay more for healthcare and defunds Planned Parenthood, which would strip low-income women of the health services they need, including cancer screenings.During an interview to defend his party s evil bill on Tuesday morning, Chaffetz actually had the gall to claim that poor people could afford health insurance if they didn t go out and purchase iPhones.Seriously, he literally used this as an excuse to strip 30 million people of their health insurance. You know what, Americans have choices, and they ve got to make a choice,  Chaffetz said.  And so maybe, rather than getting that new iPhone that they just love and want to go spend hundreds of dollars on, maybe they should invest in their own health care. Here s the video via Twitter.GOP Rep. Chaffetz: Americans may need to choose between  new iphone  they just love  and investing in health care https://t.co/5Hxwn2uOl5  New Day (@NewDay) March 7, 2017Chaffetz s ignorant remarks make it clear that he doesn t know anything about the cost of healthcare, probably because his healthcare is free courtesy of American taxpayers.As Raw Story points out, the average cost of a health insurance plan is $235 per month while an iPhone costs just $27 a month with a two-year payment plan.In short, choosing not to buy an iPhone will not do anything to help poor Americans afford healthcare.Meanwhile, Republicans like Chaffetz can actually afford to buy their own health insurance because they make $174,000 a year. But they don t have to buy their own insurance because they get government healthcare along with the best hospitals all on the taxpayer dime.Chaffetz, and every Republican who voted for this bill, is a hypocrite and they should be ashamed of themselves.Featured image via screenshot",Fake

"U.S. loan to Puerto Rico a start, but more aid to come: official WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. federal government is working on a long-term plan to help Puerto Rico rebuild after Hurricane Maria tore up the island territoryâ€™s power grid and other infrastructure three weeks ago, an administration official said on Wednesday. The U.S. House of Representatives is set to vote on Thursday on a disaster relief bill that includes a $4.9 billion loan for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands as part of a $36.5 billion package to help Americans recover from hurricanes and wildfires. But the loan is intended to be a short-term measure to help the cash-strapped island territory pay urgent bills, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. â€œThe Community Disaster Loan cannot and does not address the recovery, rebuilding and future of Puerto Rico, which the administration intends to address with a more long-term solution in concert with the Puerto Rican government, oversight board, court and Congress,â€ the official said. The broader package set for the House vote includes $576.6 million for wildfire efforts, $16 billion for the National Flood Insurance program and a provision enabling low-income Puerto Ricans to receive emergency nutrition assistance. House Speaker Paul Ryan is set to travel to Puerto Rico on Friday with a bipartisan group of lawmakers to see the hurricane damage, a spokesman said. The White House last week asked government agencies to begin estimating how much money is needed to help hurricane-hit states and territories recover and rebuild. Puerto Rico, home to 3.4 million American citizens, is in a particular bind, already grappling with nearly $72 billion in debt before Hurricane Maria - the worst storm in almost a century - hit its shores. Estimates of the cost to its economy range as high as $95 billion. Puerto Ricoâ€™s Governor Ricardo Rossello has asked for $4.6 billion as a â€œdown payment on hurricane recovery efforts,â€ including $3.2 billion in block grants. The oversight board charged with resolving Puerto Ricoâ€™s debt crisis told the U.S. Treasury Department that the islandâ€™s government would run out of money at the end of the month without help. The loan is earmarked for payroll and pensions, but cannot be used for debt service. ",Real
" Trump Continues Racist Birtherism, Wonâ€™t Say President Obama Is An American Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump s first entrance to prominence in mainstream American politics was built on the same thing his entire horrific campaign has been built on: bigotry. Specifically, bigotry against America s first black president, Barack Obama. Trump led the racist charge that would come to be known as the  birther  movement, where he and his racist followers claimed that President Obama is not a Christian American who was born in Hawaii, but was instead a Muslim born in Kenya.Of course, these wild claims have been debunked over and over again during Obama s tenure as President, but that still has not convinced The Donald. In fact, to this day, Trump refuses to admit that he was wrong, and that indeed President Obama was born right here in the United States of America. On Monday, Trump was asked if his views had changed on President Obama s place of birth, and all he would say to reporters is,  I don t talk about it. Well, Mr. Trump, you spent months upon months publicly worrying over the President s birth certificate, ginning up racism from your fellow bigots who couldn t stand that there s a Black family living in the White House, and no matter what President Obama did   including releasing his long form birth certificate as you requested   nothing was good enough for you.There s a reason for this. It s not about any sort of legitimate question regarding President Obama s origins, but about pure, unabashed racism. And here you are, a few years later, as the standard   bearer for one of America s major political parties, and you still are peddling this racist conspiracy theory in an effort to damage President Obama s legacy and deligitimize his time in the office of the presidency.Shame on you, Donald Trump. And, more to the point, shame on the Republican Party for allowing this man to carry your banner, and then claim that you don t tolerate and endorse racism.

"Illinois risks rating cut to junk even with budget: Moody's CHICAGO (Reuters) - Even if Illinoisâ€™ House of Representatives takes action to enact a new budget on Thursday, the state still risks a downgrade in its credit rating to junk, Moodyâ€™s Investors Service warned on Wednesday. The Democratic-controlled House on Thursday will attempt to overturn Republican Governor Bruce Raunerâ€™s vetoes of spending and tax increase measures aimed at ending the stateâ€™s unprecedented two-year budget impasse. Moodyâ€™s said it placed Illinoisâ€™ Baa3 rating, which is one step above the junk level, on review for a possible downgrade.  The $36 billion fiscal 2018 budget and $5 billion income tax increase passed by lawmakers over the extended Fourth of July holiday weekend, may fall short in addressing the stateâ€™s financial woes, particularly its huge unfunded pension liability and $15 billion unpaid bill backlog, according to Moodyâ€™s. â€œOn both those fronts, itâ€™s not yet clear if the legislation being enacted will have a substantial and clear positive effect,â€ said Moodyâ€™s analyst Ted Hampton. A stalemate between the Rauner and Democrats who control the legislature has left the nationâ€™s fifth-largest state without a complete budget for two-straight fiscal years. Since fiscal 2018 began on Saturday, the House and Senate in bipartisan votes passed budget bills to avoid Illinois becoming the first-ever U.S. state whose credit is rated junk. Rauner vetoed the bills on Tuesday only to have that action quickly overridden by the Senate, leaving the fate of the budget in the hands of the House.  Prior to Moodyâ€™s announcement, Rauner said his Democratic opponents should prioritize the opinions of Illinois residents over credit ratings agencies. â€œDonâ€™t listen to some Wall Street firm,â€ Rauner told reporters Wednesday at a Chicago event. â€œThatâ€™s not what matters.â€ The governor also said he is working to sustain his vetoes. â€œI can tell you this, we are doing everything we can to push that my veto is not overridden,â€ he said.  He lashed out at those who defied his wishes by voting for the Democratsâ€™ budget package, including 15 House Republicans. â€œWhat we have is a continuing failure by elected officials in Springfield on both sides of the aisle thatâ€™s been led by Speaker Madigan for 35 years,â€ Rauner said, referring to House Speaker Michael Madigan. â€œThe system is broken.â€ House Republican Leader Jim Durkin told Reuters that he and Rauner are attempting to persuade House Republicans supporters of the Democratic tax hike to reconsider their votes because â€œthereâ€™s a better deal to be had.â€ But Durkin stopped short of predicting the overrides could be blocked. â€œI think the Democrats, if they want to get it done, find the votes,â€ Durkin said. â€œIâ€™ve seen this before.â€ Durkin said he had no plans to take punitive actions against those Republicans for their votes, but predicted â€œitâ€™s definitely a possibilityâ€ some will face primary challenges from the Republican Partyâ€™s anti-tax wing in the 2018 elections. Illinois has relied on court-ordered and state-mandated spending to keep operating. The absence of a fiscal 2018 budget shuttered major transportation projects and forced the state out of the lucrative Powerball and Mega Millions lotteries. ",Real
" Rape Apparently Doesnâ€™t Earn Jail Time Anymore â€“ Even If The Victim Is Only Two Years Old If you are a young white male in America, apparently you are free to stick your genitalia into whomever you please without having to fear that you will end up in prison. Consent be damned. Proof of this is the disgusting case of an Iowa teen who raped a toddler   on camera   and was given a free pass when he was finally hauled in front of a judge for his repulsive crimes.Kraigen Grooms has admitted to raping the 2-year-old in April of 2013 when he was 16 years old. Not only did he rape the small child, but he did it on camera so he could livestream the sexual assault for another pervert to watch online. Investigators believe that the attack was premeditated, and also that he had plans to rape a 3-year-old boy in the same manner.Grooms was arrested in March 2014, when he was 17. Initially, he was charged with second-degree sexual abuse, a felony that could have put him in prison for 25 years. However, after spending two years in a juvenile detention center and county jail, he cut a deal and pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of engaging in a lascivious act with a child in July. This week, Judge Randy Degeest handed Groom, who also goes by the alias Kraigen Simmers, a 10-year suspended sentence and sent him home.This means that he will see absolutely no prison time for raping a 2-year-old. Let that sink in for a minute.This is just the most recent in a string of high-profile sexual assault cases that have ended with the rapist getting a slap on the wrist and being sent on his way. The most well-known of these cases being that of Brock Turner, who raped an unconscious woman behind a dumpster and was given just six months in jail, but ended up only serving three before being released.Is there any question that anyone who rapes a toddler   a f*cking toddler   should be behind bars until hell freezes over? Is there any question that America s rape culture has spiraled completely out of control when you can rape a 2-year-old, on camera, livestream it on the internet, and not end up in prison?Featured image via KTVO screen capture",Fake
"Trump says was being 'sarcastic' in thanking Putin for embassy staff cuts BEDMINSTER, NJ (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Friday he was being sarcastic when he thanked Russian President Vladimir Putin for saving the United States money by ordering cuts in U.S. diplomatic staff in Russia. Asked whether he was being sarcastic, Trump told reporters: â€œIn order to reduce our payroll, absolutely. I think you know that,â€ Trump said without explicitly criticizing the move. Breaking nearly two weeks of silence on Putinâ€™s July 30 order cutting U.S. embassy and consulate staff by nearly two thirds, Trump said on Thursday: â€œIâ€™m very thankful that he let go of a large number of people because now we have a smaller payroll,â€ adding â€œthereâ€™s no real reason for them to go back.â€ Trumpâ€™s remarks rekindled criticism of his kid-glove handling of Putin, especially as he has not shied away from being highly critical of members of his own party, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Putin, reacting to new sanctions imposed by the U.S. Congress and reluctantly signed into law by Trump, ordered Washington to cut its diplomatic and technical staff by 755 people by Sept. 1. Many of those affected likely will be local Russian staffers. It was also a reaction to former President Barack Obama expelling 35 Russian diplomats from the United States last December over the intelligence agency reports. â€œI was just speaking to the Secretary (of State Rex Tillerson) and weâ€™re talking about coming up with an answer ... by September 1st weâ€™ll have a response,â€ Trump said. Congressional committees and a special counsel are investigating the conclusions of U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the 2016 election campaign by hacking and other methods to help Trump, a Republican. They are also looking into possible collusion between the campaign and Russian officials. Moscow has repeatedly denied meddling in the election and Trump denies any campaign collusion. During his campaign and since becoming president, Trump has consistently called for better ties with Russia, declined to criticize Putin and refused to unequivocally embrace the conclusions of the intelligence agencies. Trumpâ€™s remarks were immediately denounced by current and former U.S. officials who have served both Republican and Democratic administrations. The remarks also raised some eyebrows in Europe. â€œI would have to say in my experience (it is) one of the most bizarre things I have ever heard from any government official, not just the U.S.,â€ Ojars Kalnins, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee at the Latvian parliament, told Reuters earlier on Friday. â€œThanking another foreign leader for firing people from their embassy is unprecedented.

The amount of fail involved in this operation is almost enough to make one s hair stand on end.The internet has noticed something else that might be a little more embarrassing for him than the rest of his failure of a trip, based on his history of going insane over his hair. He forgot to take the bobby pins out of the wet albino muskrat that functions as his hair before stepping onstage.Here, have a closer look: O.K., what I do is wash it with Head & Shoulders,  Trump once told Rolling Stone when asked if he has a combover.  I don t dry it, though. I let it dry by itself. It takes about an hour. Then I read the papers and things. OK, so I ve done all that. I then comb my hair. Yes, I do use a comb. Do I comb it forward? No, I don t comb it forward,  Trump continued. I actually don t have a bad hairline. When you think about it, it s not bad. I mean, I get a lot of credit for comb-overs. But it s not really a comb-over. It s sort of a little bit forward and back. I ve combed it the same way for years. Same thing, every time. One thing that was missing from that explanation was the existence of bobby pins.If Trump can t be honest with us about his hair routine, how can we know he s telling the truth when he says brown people are coming to kill and rape us, or his tax returns are unimportant, or that he has the very best people who will do the greatest things?You can see it in this video, if you hate yourself: trump bobby pins by DailyPoliticsFeatured image via screengrab",Fake

When a member of the press asked Spicer if he could produce some sort of proof to validate the claims that Trump had resigned from his businesses, America got a terrifying look at what the next four years were going to bring.Spicer said  I believe we have  to a question regarding documents showing that Trump had handed his businesses over to his two sons. However, White House staffer Hope Hicks jumped in and stated that these documents are not public.  Spicer continued: Yeah, but he has resigned from the company as he said he would before he took office. Don and Eric are fully in charge of the company. He s taking extraordinary steps to ensure that that s happened. So once again, we have more and more secrecy from Trump s team combined with a lack of kept promises to the American people. It should be noted that ProPublica stated that Trump has not stepped away from his businesses at all.As of last Friday, ProPublica examined several of Trump s major companies.

"Trump call for Clinton investigation 'highly inappropriate': top senator WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trumpâ€™s call for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to investigate former Democratic rival Hillary Clinton is â€œhighly inappropriateâ€ and threatens to erode the separation between law and politics, a leading Republican senator said on Tuesday. â€œProsecutorial decisions should be based on applying facts to the law without hint of political motivation. To do otherwise is to run away from the long-standing American tradition of separating the law from politics,â€ Senator Lindsey Graham said in a series of posts on Twitter. â€œPresident Trumpâ€™s tweet today suggesting Attorney General Sessions pursue prosecution of a former political rival is highly inappropriate,â€ said Graham, who defended Sessions from criticism by the president.

" Trump: Mass Shootings Will Stop If Americans Unite And Pray For Peace Clearly, Donald Trump intends to do absolutely nothing to prevent future mass shootings.The Las Vegas mass shooting is the deadliest in American history. Fifty people are dead and over 400 are wounded after a gunman used a machine gun to mow people down from his hotel room at Mandalay Bay as 22,000 concertgoers fled for their lives.Predictably, the National Rifle Association has remained silent and Republicans like Trump are only offering  thoughts and prayers  instead of taking meaningful action.Trump fumbled his first response to the shooting by offering his  warmest condolences  on Twitter. Of course, we all know that if the shooter were brown with a Muslim sounding name Trump would be calling this an act of terror and would be once again calling for a Muslim ban.But this shooter was an old white guy who used an assault rifle so the terrorism label won t be used and there will be no call for a gun ban by Trump.And that was made further clear by Trump s remarks to the nation this morning as he suggested that the only real way to stop these violent acts is to unite in prayer for peace. In moments of tragedy and horror, America comes together as one. And it always has. We call upon the bonds that unite us, our faith, our family, and our shared values. We call upon the bonds of citizenship, the ties of community, and the comfort of our common humanity. Our unity cannot be shattered by evil, our bonds cannot be broken by violence, and though we feel such great anger, at the senseless murder of our fellow citizens, it is our love that defines us today. And always will. Forever We pray for the entire nation to find unity and peace. And we pray for the day when evil is banished and the innocent are safe from hatred and from fear. Here s the video of Trump s full remarks via YouTube.Not once did Trump call this an act of terrorism. Not once did Trump mention the need for gun control. He said the word  pray  an insufferable amount of times as if prayer is the solution to gun violence. The only thing he offered these victims was prayers and a reference to the Bible and God.That s unacceptable. It s time for Republicans to acknowledge that white men commit acts of terror and it s time for them to ignore the NRA and do something to prevent future tragedies like this from occurring.This was an opportunity for Trump to actually do something courageous in response to tragedy. He failed spectacularly as usual. Thoughts, prayers, and God will not prevent mass shootings. We need gun control measures now more than ever and a renewed focus on stopping home-grown domestic terrorists. The American people need real action, not false platitudes.Featured Image: Screenshot",Fake
" WATCH: Trump Defends Russia, So John McCain HAMMERS Him With Bad News Donald Trump is Vladimir Putin s puppet, so of course he would defend Russia instead of siding with American intelligence agencies. And that did not sit well with John McCain.On Friday, the CIA released an assessment concluding that Russia hacked into our election to help Trump win. Ever since then, Trump and his team have been desperately defending Russia and insisting that Democrats made the whole thing up and that Russia would never interfere in our democratic system.During an appearance on Fox News Sunday, Chris Wallace asked Trump about the Russian hacking. Trump responded by bragging about his victory and claimed that our intelligence agencies can t possibly know that Russia hacked anything. I think it s ridiculous,  Trump said.  I don t believe it. I don t know why and I think it s just   you know, they talked about all sorts of things. Every week it s another excuse. We had a massive landslide victory as you know in the electoral college. Hacking is very interesting,  Trump continued.  Once they hack, if you don t catch them in the act, you re not going to catch them. They have no idea if it s Russia or China or somebody. It could be somebody sitting in a bed someplace. Trump just demonstrated that he knows nothing about how technology works beyond how to use Twitter. Hacking leaves traces that experts can follow to identify the culprit. But instead of believing the experts, Trump tried to pin everything on the Democrats. I think the Democrats are putting it out because they suffered one of the greatest defeats in the history of politics in this country,  Trump claimed.  And frankly, I think they re putting it out. It s ridiculous. Trump went on to lecture that the CIA should blame other countries or individuals for the hack if they are going to report on what happened, but he couldn t end the interview without bragging again. We had   many people are saying   one of the great victories of all time. Here s the video via YouTube.First of all, Trump s  victory  is not even close to being one of greatest of all time. As it turns out, we keep the records of every presidential election and the records show that in the last 100 years alone, there are 18 elections in which a candidate did way better than Trump, including President Obama is 2008 and 2009. So it was NOT a  landslide  or a  mandate  like Trump imagines.Second, Trump is clearly denying the facts again, which is why Senator John McCain delivered the hard truth on Face The Nation.McCain said that he wants a bipartisan investigation by Congress to confirm the CIA assessment and he is totally bewildered by Trump s defense of Russia despite the evidence. I don t know what to make of it,  McCain said of Trump s claims.  Because it s clear the Russians interfered. Now whether they intended to interfere to the degree that they were trying to elect a certain candidate, I think that s a subject of investigation. Facts are stubborn things. They did hack into this campaign. Here s the video via YouTube.Featured image via Screenshot",Fake
" Hereâ€™s Proof Top Republicans Have Already Given Up On Trump Republican strategists and party officials are circulating a plan of action that they are close to enacting, based on the premise that Donald Trump will almost certainly lose the presidential election. The plan is a way for congressional campaigns to untangle themselves from the Trump campaign, saving their own skins in November.Party strategists are mapping out blueprints for down-ballot candidates, in TV ads and on the campaign trail, to present themselves as checks on a Hillary Clinton presidency. It s an approach that would essentially admit a Trump loss. In interviews, nearly one dozen Republican operatives said they had begun poll-testing the idea   which one labeled a  break glass in case of emergency  strategy   to gauge how the public would react to it.The last time Republicans essentially abandoned their nominee was in 1996, when it became clear that Senator Bob Dole would lose to President Bill Clinton. Clinton went on to win that race with 379 electoral votes and victories in 31 states and Washington, D.C. But Republicans were able to stop the bleeding and held on to House and Senate seats.Politico reports that the emergency election plan involves an appeal based on telling voters that Republicans want congressional seats in order to provide a check on the power that Hillary Clinton would have as President. Infamous Republican political operative Karl Rove seems to be on board.The deliberations extend to the highest levels of the party. American Crossroads, the influential conservative group that was co-founded by Karl Rove, has tested to see how voters would feel about Republicans casting themselves as being a check and balance to Hillary Clinton, according to four sources familiar with the deliberations.The existence of this plan, and the fact that so much of it is already mapped out, is very nearly a concession in the presidential race before it s even September.Featured image via Flickr",Fake
" Trump Gets Brutally Reminded Of The Sh*tty Way He Treated McCain After Releasing Pathetic Statement Donald Trump surely saw this response coming.After all, he hasn t exactly been very respectful of Senator John McCain in recent years.On Wednesday night, it was announced that McCain has a brain tumor. Almost instantly, a shocked nation delivered a wave of support for the Vietnam war hero.One particular message came from President Obama, who warned McCain s cancer that it picked a fight with the wrong man.McCain was captured by the Vietnamese after his plane was shot down in 1967. He would remain a prisoner of war until being released in 1973, but not before he suffered brutal torture at the hands of his captors, torture that would leave him unable to raise his hands above his head for the rest of his life.McCain s service to this country is irrefutable and he is undeniably a hero for what he went through.Not long after President Obama released a statement, Donald Trump released his own on Twitter, referring to McCain as a  fighter  and told him to  get well soon.

"U.S. lawmakers say Trump administration still lacks clear North Korea plan WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers said high-profile briefings by the Trump administration on North Korea on Wednesday failed to provide the firm strategy they had hoped for dealing with what they described as a major national security threat. As a standoff escalated over the reclusive Asian nationâ€™s development of nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles, President Donald Trump welcomed all 100 members of the Senate to a highly unusual meeting at the White House complex, with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and Marine General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. While administration officials often travel to the Capitol to brief lawmakers on national security issues, this time the entire Senate hopped on buses to the White House. Vice President Mike Pence and the four officials later briefed the House of Representatives. That classified meeting took place in a secure auditorium at the Capitol complex. The briefings came as Trump tries to put the best face on his first 100 days in office. He has signed executive orders to roll back Democratic policies but the period has been defined by an absence of any major legislative achievements. A few Democrats dismissed the Senate White House â€œfield tripâ€ as little more than a photo opportunity.  Some Republicans were a little more enthusiastic. â€œIt was an OK briefing,â€ Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters as he arrived back at the Senate. â€œIâ€™m not certain I would have had the briefing today,â€ he said. Asked if the administration had a firm strategy, Senator John McCain, who chairs the Armed Services Committee, said, â€œTheyâ€™re developing one.â€ This week, Trump has discussed North Korea with U.N. ambassadors, increased the U.S. military presence in the region, and leaned on China to pressure Pyongyang. Tillerson will chair a U.N. Security Council meeting on Friday to discuss tougher sanctions. After their briefing, members of the House expressed confidence in the administration officials who spoke, but some said they had real concerns. Representative Brad Sherman, a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said he was not convinced that the administration would do enough to control Pyongyang. â€œI regard that level of resolve as very modest, weak and maybe even phony. The only way to put enough pressure on North Korea is to get China to do it,â€ Sherman told reporters. Mac Thornberry, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said the administration wants to use â€œa varietyâ€ of tactics to push North Korea to give up its nuclear ambitions and said he agreed that all options must be on the table. â€œWe have to have incredible military presence in the region, including missile defense, especially for this regime,â€ he said.

" BREAKING: Republicans Susan Collins And Lisa Murkowski Will Vote No On Betsy DeVos Susan Collins, Republican Senator from Maine, has once again broke with her party after announcing she will vote  no  on Donald Trump s education secretary nominee Betsy DeVos.Lisa Murkowski, Senator from Alaska, will also vote  no  on DeVos.On the Senate floor, Collins made a passionate speech about her reservations (which are shared by fellow Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Maine), saying:I come to the floor to announce a very difficult decision that I have made, and that is to vote against the confirmation of Betsy DeVos to be our nation s next Secretary of Education.The move comes unexpectedly, as Collins voted in favor of DeVos in committee, which passed on a party line and sent her nomination to the floor for an up-or-down vote. But at that time, Collins made clear she was still considering her support. Murkowski had also voted to send DeVos  consideration to the floor.Collins had told the Bangor Daily News that she was  surprised and concerned  about her  apparent lack of familiarity  on a wide range of education issues. One issue that particularly struck Collins was the fact DeVos seemed clueless to the fact the United States has protections for students with disabilities.Susan Collins has so far been a thorn in the side of Donald Trump and his administration, recently referring to his immigration executive action as  likely unconstitutional,  and blasting Steve Bannon s appointment to the National Security Council as  entirely inappropriate. As of now, 50 senators have come out against DeVos, including Collins, Murkowski and every member of the Democratic caucus (which includes independents Bernie Sanders and Angus King). DeVos needs a simple majority to pass, and with 52 members in the GOP caucus, DeVos has a slim chance of being confirmed. If one more Republican defects, the 50-50 tie that would be broken by Vice President Mike Pence will be blockedOnce again, Susan Collins has put the country before her party, and has showed the GOP what it means to have a spine, as has Murkowski.Here s to hoping more Republicans follow their lead.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",Fake

" Man Who Tried To Dictate What Women Can Wear Gets ROYALLY OWNED In His Own House Very little is more infuriating for women than to have our appearances policed. Yet, police us people do, usually by criticizing what s in fashion and calling it too immodest, and crying that men can t stop staring and thus are sinning in their hearts, or saying that women over a certain age should not wear this or that. One of the latest incidents comes from Alan Sorrentino, of Rhode Island, who wrote a letter to editor for EastBayRI saying women over 20 should not be wearing yoga pants in public.Yoga pants draw a lot of ire from the supposedly pious and the supposedly weak-willed. Sorrentino s specific targeting of women in yoga pants earned him a  yoga pants parade  through the street in front of his house. Hundreds of people men and women participated while wearing yoga pants.Yes, there were men wearing yoga pants to stand in solidarity with women who are tired of being told what they can and cannot wear, and paraded with women in front of Sorrentino s house. Sorrentino got more than an eyeful of the  struggles with physicality  that he doesn t want to see anymore: To all yoga pant wearers, I struggle with my own physicality as I age. I don t want to struggle with yours. Thanks. His problem is that, as women age, we lose our beauty and our bodies, which, to people like him, necessarily restrict what we can wear. It s like he thinks that if we re not young and beautiful, we should hide ourselves in some way (oh wait, that s exactly what he thinks): Like the mini-skirt, yoga pants can be adorable on children and young women who have the benefit of nature s blessing of youth. However, on mature, adult women there is something bizarre and disturbing about the appearance they make in public. Maybe it s the unforgiving perspective they provide, inappropriate for general consumption, TMI, or the spector [sic] of someone coping poorly with their weight or advancing age that makes yoga pants so weird in public.A nice pair of tailored slacks, jeans, or anything else would be better than those stinky, tacky, ridiculous looking yoga pants. They do nothing to compliment a women over 20 years old. In fact, the look is bad. Do yourself a favor, grow up and stop wearing them in public.  [emphasis mine]How disgusting. If someone is dressed or presenting an appearance we don t want to see, we can, you know, just look somewhere else. Or better yet, we can accept that there are things in this world that we personally would rather not see. Truly mature people, one of whom Sorrentino clearly isn t, recognize that it s not our place to tell other people what they can and cannot wear based on our personal comfort.Sorrentino is now claiming he wrote the letter as a joke, and the paper is defending its decision to publish it by explaining that they publish all opinions as long as they aren t attacking a person or a group: In this case, Mr. Sorrentino is not attacking any individual nor specific group. It s safe to assume that his comments target a large portion of America s female population, and that group obviously has ample firepower to respond to Mr. Sorrentino and his opinions. Telling women over 20 how they can and cannot dress isn t attacking women? Okay then. That s systemic sexism, though. Here s hoping the yoga pants parade got Sorrentino s attention, and he rethinks his position. Joke or not, it was inappropriate at best.Here s a short video from the parade:The #YogaPantsParade is underway @ABC6 pic.twitter.com/VItosLSLaA  Bianca Buono (@BBuonoABC6) October 23, 2016Featured image via screen capture from embedded video",Fake

"Republican tax bill hits wind power, solar largely unscathed (Reuters) - A Republican tax bill unveiled on Thursday included cuts to renewable energy tax credits considered critical to enabling wind projects to compete with fossil fuel plants, but tax breaks for solar power were left largely intact. The credits, which receive broad bipartisan support, were extended by Congress less than two years ago. The wind industry decried the proposal, saying it put $50 billion in planned investment at risk, while the solar sector expressed relief the bill mostly preserved the timeline laid out in 2015 for its primary tax credit. In the same legislation, Republicans proposed eliminating the $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles. Greg Wetstone, president of the non-profit American Council on Renewable Energy, said the move was â€œmystifying.â€ â€œWind has particularly been a boon in rural areas where there arenâ€™t a lot of economic choices,â€ Wetstone said, noting that wind had strong support in the Senate, which has yet to weigh in on the bill. Of major concern to wind developers, the legislation called for a reduced credit for every kilowatt-hour of energy produced from wind projects.  In 2015 and 2016, the credit was worth 2.4 cents, dropping by 20 percent each year for projects that start construction from 2017 through 2019. In the proposed bill, that credit would drop to 1.5 cents per kwh. In addition, projects must show that there is continuous construction in order to claim the tax credit available on the day construction starts.  The provision would increase tax revenue by $12.3 billion from 2018 to 2027, according to the bill summary. In a statement, the American Wind Energy Association trade group said investors and project developers had banked on the stability of the policy enacted in 2015 in planning billions of dollars of investment in wind energy. â€œThe House proposal would pull the rug out from under 100,000 U.S. wind workers and 500 American factories,â€ AWEA Chief Executive Tom Kiernan said in a statement. The solar industryâ€™s main trade group, the Solar Energy Industries Association, said it was encouraged that a tax credit worth 30 percent of the value of a solar project had been left mostly intact. Under current law, that credit is scheduled to step down in value gradually until 2022, when it becomes a permanent 10 percent credit only for utility and commercial projects. The bill unveiled on Thursday would eliminate the 10 percent tax credit, but not until after 2027. ",Real
" White Supremacist GOP Congressman Says Colleagues Are â€˜Patting Him On The Backâ€™ For Racist Tweets The Republican Party is constantly pushing back against accusations of being a racist institution, despite the fact that they endorse and celebrate racists in their ranks. Hell, they even tolerate outright white supremacists. Case in point   Representative Steve King ( R-Iowa). Rep. King has a long history of racially charged remarks, but here lately he has really gone over the top, most recently with a tweet that was nothing more than a white supremacist rant about how American can t keep its population up with, quote,  somebody else s babies.

We can't restore our civilization with somebody else's babies. https://t.co/4nxLipafWO  Steve King (@SteveKingIA) March 12, 2017Of course, the backlash from Democrats and other people who aren t complete racist pieces of shit was swift, but many of his Republican colleagues were curiously silent at King s blatant racism. Well, now, King himself has given us the answer as to why the condemnation didn t come from elected GOP officials as it should: Because, privately, they agree with him. King said: My colleagues have generally been coming by and patting me on the back. And a surprising number have said that they pray for me. And, meaning they support me and they agree with me, a surprising number. I don t often have members come up and say at the end of the day,  I prayed for you this morning.  So they must think I ve got a lot of arrows in my back. The only Republicans who condemned King s offensive remarks were those who are the children of immigrants themselves. Rep.

But I would say of my Republican critics, you should take a look on their position on immigration and see where they stand. There seems to be a curious coincidence. When Rep. Curbelo heard what King has said, the remarks were greeted with an eyeroll, and he said: I saw him down at conference, and I said,  Hey, I just want to know if I m somebody else s baby.  He said,  You should have called me.  I said,  I don t have your number.  So he sent me his number and we agreed we d talk whenever we both time to sit down and talk about it.

" Paul Ryan Responds To Trumpâ€™s â€˜Loyaltyâ€™ Request To Comey, This Is Beyond Pathetic (DETAILS) Donald Trump has brought more corruption into the White House than anyone during his short time as President of the United States, and the sad thing about it is that the Republican Party is more than happy to defend him or look the other way whenever he f*cks up.Earlier today, as the testimony of former FBI Director James Comey threatened to derail Trump, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan defended one of Trump s most inappropriate incidents. According to Ryan, Trump s disastrous request for Comey to be  loyal  to him should be totally excusable because Trump is  just new to this. Proving that Ryan is just as spineless as we all thought he was, this comment greatly differed from what he said yesterday about Trump s request, when the House Speaker called the request for loyalty inappropriate. Ryan had said: Yeah, no. I mean, obviously, I don t think that is. But today, Ryan was more than happy to make excuses for Trump, who hasn t learned a damn thing since he s been in office. Ryan is fine with passing off all of Trump s incompetencies as a simple  the president s new at this , which was his response to the private conversations between Trump and Comey. Ryan said: He s new to government, and so he probably wasn t steeped in the long-running protocols that establish the relationships between DOJ, FBI and White Houses. He s just new to this. That defense is honestly revolting, and the entire GOP should be ashamed of itself. They helped elect an idiot who has no idea how the government works, and hasn t even bothered to learn since becoming president. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, another Republican and Trump defender, also blamed Trump s actions on innocent naivety. He said:Trump  is now very publicly learning about the way people react to what he considers to be normal New York City conversation.

"With or without Democratic director, U.S. consumer watchdog to be weakened WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Whether or not Richard Cordray stays as head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) until his term ends in July, the agencyâ€™s ability to rein in Wall Street will be severely weakened, political insiders, lawyers and consumer advocates said. Doubts are growing that the Democratic director of Americaâ€™s top consumer watchdog will leave his post to run for Ohio governor, as had been widely speculated, after a lackluster Labor Day speech sparked anxiety over his campaign appeal, according to some party insiders. Cordray, whose term at the CFPB ends in July 2018, is not expected to announce any decision to run until the regulator releases long-awaited rules restricting payday lenders, which are expected within weeks, according to multiple sources. Cordray has evaded questions from the Republican chairman on the House of Representatives Financial Services committee, Jeb Hensarling, about his plans, writing in a recent letter: â€œAt this time, I have no further insights to provide on that subject.â€ Even if Cordray stays, he will not enjoy a reprieve from Republican efforts to defang the agency which they believe is too powerful and restricts the flow of credit. â€œHe has been under constant attack in his position because of the threat he poses to the status quo on Wall Street,â€ said Karl Frisch, executive director of Allied Progress, a consumer advocacy group which has called for Cordray to stay on. â€œI would imagine that would continue regardless of how long he stays in the job.â€ Some Republicans, including Hensarling, have introduced legislation to weaken and even dismantle the agency which was created as part of the post-crisis Dodd Frank Act. While those bills have not gotten far, Cordray will still have to play defense against a Republican-dominated Congress poised to suffocate new CFPB rules using the Congressional Review Act, a mechanism already used to kill 14 Obama-era regulations. Lawmakers are also considering amending the government budget to bring the CFPBâ€™s funding, currently provided by the independent Federal Reserve, under the control of Congress, potentially allowing Republicans to starve the agency of resources. President Donald Trump could also take the more extreme step of intervening to remove Cordray.  A court ruling last year said the president should be able to fire the CFPB director without cause, which the CFPB is appealing. Even if the CFPB is victorious, Trump may still seek to use causes allowed by the law, such as inefficiency or neglect of duty, to get Cordray out of the way, according to legal experts. The CFPB has declined to comment multiple times on Cordrayâ€™s plans, possible successors or how it would operate in his absence. Since Trump came to power, the CFPB has raced to finish outstanding rule proposals and taken numerous enforcement actions, hoping to lock in its work in case Trump appoints a pro-Wall Street replacement, said Quyen Truong, a partner at law firm Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, who was the assistant director and deputy general counsel for the CFPB until early 2016. If Cordray quits or is removed, Dodd-Frank requires his deputy to step up temporarily but lawyers say the legitimacy of that step could be challenged. The act may be superseded by a law that allows the president to temporarily fill vacancies.  Alan Kaplinsky, head of the Consumer Financial Services Group at law firm Ballard Spahr and a Cordray critic, said the White House is widely expected to appoint Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin as an interim replacement, who would then delegate his duties to lower-ranking officials. Scrapping a new rule allowing bank and credit-card customers to band together in class-action lawsuits and tougher regulation of payday lenders will likely be a Trump appointeeâ€™s first moves, Kaplinsky said. This could be done by delaying the ruleâ€™s effective date for further study, a common Washington tactic used to stall the implementation of regulation indefinitely. An acting director could also dramatically scale back the consumer complaint database, a key tool the CFPB uses to resolve disputes for individuals and to identify corporate malfeasance, Truong said. Meanwhile, she said, the agency will continue pursuing enforcement cases, but those will likely be much smaller in scope.

Essentially, their view is that healthcare is not a right and should only be available to the people who had the foresight to be born into a wealthy or near wealthy family.Despite the fact that overall, Obamacare has been wildly successful, even with Republicans putting up every obstacle possible, about 24 million people have health insurance and would lose it without the Affordable Care Act. Republicans don t care. One Republican, though, has a solution, but there are two small problems: it s not a solution at all and it s tantamount to child abuse.In an interview with MLive.com, Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-MI) regaled the reporter with a story of how he waited a night to take his son to the doctor, when his son had a broken arm. Somehow, Huizenga thinks that s a good thing. We weren t sure what was going on. It was in the evening, so I splinted it up and we wrapped it up, and the decision was, okay, do we go to the ER? We thought it was a sprain, but weren t sure,  Huizenga said, adding that he and his wife  took every precaution and decided to go in the next morning. When it [comes to] those type of things, do you keep your child home from school and take him the next morning to the doctor because of a cold or a flu, versus take him into the emergency room? If you don t have a cost difference, you ll make different decisions,  he said.Here s the video:Yes, that s the Republican line. People should shop for healthcare. Of course, that s possible with some procedures, but for most, it s not at all. Besides, have you ever tried to pin down actual costs for medical procedures? It s not easy. Hospitals and doctor s offices aren t exactly known for offering full disclosure when it comes to pricing. Many people in this country aren t lucky enough to live in areas where there is even competition.Beyond that, though, waiting to treat a broken arm so you can save a few bucks is child abuse and for those who don t have health insurance, there s often no option but to go to the emergency room.Featured image via video screen capture.

"Japan's Abe: agreed with Trump, Putin on cooperation over North Korea TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he and U.S. President Donald Trump agreed on Sunday that the international community must step up its response to North Korea after Pyongyang announced it had tested a hydrogen bomb. Abe said he had agreed separately with Russian President Vladimir Putin to cooperate on North Korea. â€œPresident Trump and I shared the view that we cannot overlook North Koreaâ€™s reckless act and that the international community must show its resolve by applying stronger pressure than had so far been usedâ€, Abe told reporters after the call. â€œWe again confirmed that Japan and the United States are 100 percent together.â€ It was their second phone call of the day and their fourth since North Korea fired a missile over Japan on Tuesday. Abe said he and Putin agreed that â€œNorth Koreaâ€™s reckless act is a serious threatâ€ and that they would maintain close contact on the issue.  He noted that he and the Russian leader are scheduled to meet this week on the sidelines of a gathering in Vladivostok. ",Real
" Harry Reid UNLEASHES Anti-Trump Rant On Senate Floor, Calls Him A â€˜Human Leechâ€™ (VIDEO) Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid has it out for Republican nominee Donald Trump.On Thursday on the Senate floor, Senator Reid (D-Nev.) unleashed a rant against the business mogul with a bitterness that makes you wonder just how long he had been holding it in. Reid is approaching retirement as January draws near, and it s clear that the Democratic leader wants America to understand just how important it is to make sure that the country isn t left in Trump s little, orange, greedy hands.Making reference to a Newsweek article that questions the Trump Organization s international business ties and suggests that a President Trump could be disastrous for national security, Reid called Trump  a spoiled brat  and  a notorious con artist  whose questionable, scammy business practices would only spill over into his administration if he becomes President. Reid said: Let s be clear about Donald Trump. He s a spoiled brat, raised in plenty, who inherited a fortune, used his money to make more money, and he did a lot of it by swindling working men and women. Why would he change as president? The answer is simple. Trump won t change. He is asking us to let him get rich scamming America. Donald Trump is only trying to help one person   Donald Trump.   If given the opportunity, Donald Trump will turn America into a big scam, just like Trump University. Reid also raised some eyebrows by calling Trump a  human leech. Trump is a human leech, who will bleed the country and sit at his golf resort laughing at the money he has made. You can watch Reid s amazing anti-Trump rant below: Reid s rant is pretty epic and judging from his other statements about Trump, there s probably many more Trump disses on the way before his retirement. Just earlier this week, Reid attacked Trump for insulting Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton s health by calling Trump fat and drawing attention to his own unhealthy lifestyle. Reid said: Take a look at this character that s running for president. He complains about her health? What does he do? He s 70 years old, he s not slim and trim, he brags about eating fast food every day. Look at his health a little bit. Let s just say we hope Harry Reid keeps this up!Featured image via Alex Wong / Getty Images",Fake
"Highlights: The Trump presidency on April 13 at 9:30 P.M. EDT/0130 GMT on Friday (Reuters) - Highlights for U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s administration on Thursday: The United States drops a massive GBU-43 bomb, the largest non-nuclear bomb it has ever used in combat, in Afghanistan against a series of caves used by Islamic State militants, the Pentagon says. Trump says Pyongyang is a problem that â€œwill be taken care ofâ€ amid speculation that North Korea is on the verge of a sixth nuclear test. Military force cannot resolve tension over North Korea, China warns, while an influential Chinese newspaper urges Pyongyang to halt its nuclear program in exchange for Beijingâ€™s protection. The Trump administration is focusing its North Korea strategy on tougher economic sanctions, possibly including intercepting cargo ships and punishing Chinese banks doing business with Pyongyang, U.S. officials say. Trump says â€œthings will work out fineâ€ between the United States and Russia, a day after declaring U.S.-Russian relations may be at an all-time low. Trump signals he could be moving closer to the mainstream on monetary policy, saying he has not ruled out reappointment of Janet Yellen as Federal Reserve chair as he considers his choices for the U.S. central bank. [nL1N1HL14B] Trump signs a resolution that will allow U.S. states to restrict how federal funds for contraception and reproductive health are spent, a move cheered by anti-abortion campaigners. Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen presses Deutsche Bank to release information about issues including Trumpâ€™s debt and any bank meetings with Trump administration officials, saying he has â€œgreat concernâ€ about possible conflicts of interest. EXPORT-IMPORT BANK Trumpâ€™s office says he plans to revive the hobbled Export-Import Bank of the United States, a victory for American manufacturers such as Boeing Co and General Electric Co that have overseas customers that use the agencyâ€™s government-backed loans to purchase their products. Top Wall Street bankers say they are having positive discussions about financial regulation in Washington, and downplay the idea U.S. policymakers may force their institutions to split up. The United States is pushing for trade to be a key issue in top-level economic talks with Japan, a source says, an unwelcome development for Tokyo, which is seeking to fend off U.S. pressure to reduce the bilateral trade imbalance. Trumpâ€™s administration has focused on one group of illegal immigrants more than others: women with children, according to eight Department of Homeland Security officials interviewed by Reuters about agency planning.

"Trump tells lawmakers he expects deal 'very quickly' on healthcare WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump told a group of senators on Tuesday that he expected lawmakers would be able to reach a deal on healthcare, without offering specifics on how they would do it or what had changed since a healthcare reform bill was pulled last week for insufficient support. â€œI have no doubt that thatâ€™s going to happen very quickly,â€ Trump said at a bipartisan reception held for senators and their spouses at the White House. â€œI think itâ€™s going to happen because weâ€™ve all been promising - Democrat, Republican - weâ€™ve all been promising that to the American people,â€ he said. A Republican plan backed by Trump to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system was pulled on Friday after it failed to garner enough support to pass the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. Trump, a Republican, did not mention that failure at the reception nor did he offer specifics on how he planned for lawmakers to reach a consensus on a healthcare bill that would repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, familiarly known as Obamacare.  Trump told lawmakers at the reception that he would be talking about infrastructure and investing in the military, without offering a time frame or details. â€œHopefully, it will start being bipartisan, because everybody really wants the same thing. We want greatness for this country that we love,â€ he said. ",Real
"Trump, Puerto Rico governor to discuss hurricane aid at White House WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello are due to meet at the White House on Thursday to discuss rebuilding efforts after Hurricane Maria devastated the island a month ago, the White House said. The Trump administration and Congress are considering further assistance for the bankrupt U.S. territory as it seeks to recover from its worst natural disaster in 90 years. The catastrophic storm struck on Sept. 20, causing widespread flooding and damaging homes, roads and other infrastructure. Less than 20 percent of the 3.4 million Americans who live on the island have electricity, after the power grid was wrecked, and 35 percent still lack drinking water. Disaster costs are expected to run into the tens of billions of dollars. The U.S. Congress is currently working on boosting funding for emergency relief as well as a $4.9 billion loan to help Rosselloâ€™s cash-strapped government, which is poised to run out of money for payroll and essential services at the end of the month. â€œThe meeting is related to the current recovery and response in Puerto Rico, and the long-term recovery process and what itâ€™s going to take to recover in all aspects,â€ said Carlos Mercader, a spokesman for the territoryâ€™s government. â€œWe need to think about rebuilding Puerto Rico in a holistic way. All the crops are all dead, agriculture is dead, housing is destroyed,â€ he said, noting more than 50,000 homes were destroyed and more than 660,000 individuals have so far filed claims with the federal government. Rossello asked Trump on Oct. 2 to expand the disaster declaration that provides for federal emergency services to allow federal funds to be spent on fixing damaged schools, buildings, and power plants. The governor has also asked the White House and Congress for at least $4.6 billion in block grants and other types of funding. The White House budget office asked departments and agencies to provide estimates of funding needs by Oct. 24. Trump visited the Caribbean island earlier this month to view the damage and meet with Rossello. But he and White House aides have suggested there would be a limit to how much help Puerto Rico could expect from Washington to solve its long-term issues. ",Real

" Senate Democrats Introduce Bill To Fight Back Against Trumpâ€™s Corruption â€“ Trump LIVID If Donald Trump thinks he can use the presidency to make business deals for himself and his family, Senate Democrats are prepared to defend the sanctity of the office.Over the course of the campaign and after the election, Trump has insisted that his many conflicts of interest surrounding his business empire do not matter. But the Constitution says that officeholders in the United States government may not receive presents, emoluments, or titles from foreign states.Article I, section 9 states,No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.And since Trump s business receives money from foreign nations, he would be violating the Constitution on the first day of his administration. And it s even worse when one considers that Trump s businesses have ties to businesses backed by foreign governments such as in the Philippines, and that foreign governments could blackmail Trump by threatening his profits or his foreign business partners. Trump could also use the presidency to extract business deals from nations in exchange for American support or aid, even if helping certain nations goes against the best interests of our country.In short, Trump should be forced to put his company in a blind trust or sell it altogether to avoid these problems and put these conflicts of interest to rest.That s why Senate Democrats plan to introduce a bill to do just that. Our President-elect has significantly greater risk of business and financial conflicts of interest than any other president, yet has so far refused to follow the precedent set by previous presidents. To this day, President-elect Trump has refused to address his conflicts of interest,  Senator Chris Coons said.Coons, along with Senators Elizabeth Warren, Ben Cardin, Dick Durbin, and Jeff Merkley have all endorsed the legislation and pointed out that presidents have divested their financial interests to avoid violating the Constitution for decades. If Trump is allowed to be president and keep his business decades of precedent would be wiped out, paving the way for anyone to use the presidency for personal profit. The American people deserve to know that the President of the United States is working to do what s best for the country   not using his office to do what s best for himself and his businesses,  Elizabeth Warren said.  The only way for President-elect Trump to truly eliminate conflicts of interest is to divest his financial interests and place them in a blind trust. This has been the standard for previous presidents, and our bill makes clear the continuing expectation that President-elect Trump do the same. Republicans, of course, will probably refuse to bring the bill to a vote on the Senate floor, and if they do they ll be helping Trump violate the Constitution that they claim to hold so dear.Senate Democrat s are preparing for a war and they should be. After all, Republicans have established precedent for obstructing and attacking a president over the last eight years and turnabout is fair play. Anything less than fighting Trump s agenda every second of every day over the next four years is unacceptable.Featured Image: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",Fake
"Pennsylvania governor to let state budget become law (Reuters) - Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf said on Monday he would allow an unbalanced budget of just under $32 billion to become law at midnight after state lawmakers failed to agree on a plan to close a $2 billion deficit. Wolf had 10 days from June 30th to either sign or veto the legislation. He chose to let it become law automatically at midnight without his signature. The legislature approved the spending part of the budget June 30th, beating a July 1 deadline by just hours.Â However, Republicans, who dominate both houses of the legislature, were unable to agree on a way to close the budget gap. â€œIn the coming days, it is my hope that the General Assembly will come together to pass a responsible solution to balance our books,â€ Wolf, a Democrat said in a statement. â€œThere are many options available to balance the budget in the long-term.â€ The fiscal 2018 budget is about $450 million larger than last year. The budget shortfall is due in large part to revenue collections this fiscal year which were $1.6 billion below expectations. In order to close the gap, the state is considering borrowing $1 billion, to be repaid with money U.S. states still receive every year from their 1998 legal settlement with tobacco companies for health expenses. Republicans have also discussed a wide expansion in casino gambling, and discussed but rejected placing as many as 40,000 video gambling devices around the state. Democrats want a severance tax on oil and gas production that would feed the general fund. That idea has failed to pass in previous years. â€œEvery year our Commonwealth borrows money and uses accounting gimmicks to meet our obligations, digging us deeper and deeper into a hole,â€ said Democratic Senator Daylin Leach. â€œWe need new sustainable revenue just to keep the lights on and avoid yet another credit downgrade,â€ he said. On July 6, S&P Global put Pennsylvaniaâ€™s AA-minus credit rating on watch for potential downgrade due to budget concerns. ",Real
"U.S. Treasury tax study slammed as 'fake math' by Democrats WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department on Monday released a one-page analysis of the economic and fiscal impact of a Republican tax overhaul plan that was swiftly criticized by a number of tax experts and attacked as â€œfake mathâ€ by Democrats. Treasury said the tax plan would more than pay for itself in 10 years, basing its forecast on a 2.9 percent annual economic growth assumption, a level well above most economistsâ€™ expectations, as well other changes on which the White House has made little progress. â€œWe are pleased to release an analysis demonstrating the revenue impact of the administrationâ€™s economic agenda,â€ Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs (GS.N) banker, said in a statement. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a conservative fiscal watchdog in Washington, said the Mnuchin analysis â€œmakes a mockery of dynamic scoring and analysis,â€ referring to methods for forecasting the impact of tax changes on the economy. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said the Treasury analysis was â€œnothing more than one page of fake math.â€ â€œItâ€™s clear the White House and Republicans are grasping at straws to prove the unprovable and garner votes for a bill that nearly every single independent analysis has concluded will blow up the deficit and generate almost no additional economic activity to make up for it,â€ he said in a statement.     The sparring over economic forecasts came as Republicans resumed efforts to reconcile two tax-overhaul bills, one approved by the Senate and one by the House of Representatives. President Donald Trump wants a single tax bill on his desk soon so he can sign it into law before the end of the year, in what would be his first major legislative achievement since taking office in January. The Republican president will deliver a speech on Wednesday â€œto the American people on how tax reform will lead to a brighter future for them and their families,â€ the White House said in a statement. Republicans are driving toward approval of a debt-financed package of deep tax cuts for businesses and the wealthy and a mixed bag of results for middle-class Americans. Although the Republicans see the effort as crucial to their prospects in November 2018â€™s congressional elections, nearly half of Americans oppose the plan, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. The Treasury analysis was meant to help bolster long-standing promises from Republicans, including Mnuchin, that their proposed tax cuts would super-charge an already growing economy and raise more than enough new tax revenue to offset a large federal deficit increase. Congressional researchers have estimated the Republican plan would add $1.5 trillion to the $20 trillion national debt over 10 years, before any projected positive effects on the economy, or $1 trillion after such effects. In its analysis, Treasury said its projected 2.9 percent annual growth over the next decade would result not only from tax cuts but â€œa combination of regulatory reform, infrastructure development, and welfare reform as proposed in the administrationâ€™s Fiscal Year 2018 budget.â€ The Trump administration sent a budget to Congress earlier this year that lawmakers largely ignored. While the White House has rolled back some regulations, it has made no substantial progress on infrastructure development or welfare changes. Growth of 2.9 percent would produce $1.8 trillion in new tax revenues over 10 years, more than enough to offset the revenue that the tax plan would lose, the department said. â€œWe acknowledge that some economists predict different growth rates,â€ it added in a statement accompanying its analysis, which focused on the tax plan as approved more than three weeks ago by the Senate Finance Committee. The full Senate on Dec. 2 approved a somewhat different plan, which would boost gross domestic product by 0.7 percent in 2018 and have little effect on GDP in the decade ahead, said the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank, in a report on Monday. Wharton Business School at the University of Pennsylvania also issued a report on Monday finding the plan approved by the full Senate would add $1.5 trillion to the national debt over 10 years, â€œeven with assumptions favorable to economic growth.â€ ",Real
"U.S. Attorney General Sessions urges crackdown on asylum policies FALLS CHURCH, Va.,  (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said on Thursday the policies that allow immigrants to seek asylum in the United States were broken and subject to â€œrampant abuse and fraud.â€ In a speech at the departmentâ€™s Executive Office For Immigration Review, Sessions said too many immigrants were taking advantage of the rules, and urged Congress to pass legislation that could make it harder for asylum petitions to be granted. Overhauling the U.S. asylum system was on a list of immigration proposals the White House sent Congress over the weekend that President Donald Trump wants in exchange for a legislative fix for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. Most of the principles, including a crackdown on the influx of Central American unaccompanied minors, are likely to be non-starters for Democrats. Sessions did not announce any specific policy shifts in his speech but urged Congress to act. â€œCongress must pass the legislative priorities President Trump announced this week, which included significant asylum reform, swift border returns, and enhanced interior enforcement,â€ he said.  He said there were â€œloopholesâ€ in the law that allow immigrants, whom federal officials determine have a â€œcredible fearâ€ of returning to their home countries, to be released pending a hearing before a judge. He also advocated for imposing and enforcing penalties for â€œbaselessâ€ asylum applications, elevating the threshold standard of proof in credible fear interviews, and expanding the ability to return asylum seekers to safe third countries. After they pass their credible fear review, many people simply disappear and never show up at their immigration hearings, Sessions said. He blamed the Obama administration for a policy shift in 2009 that allowed them to be released from custody, and said he believed many peoplesâ€™ credible fear claims were simply a â€œruse to enter the country illegally.â€ Human Rights First, a group that provides pro bono legal assistance to refugees, said the attorney generalâ€™s comments mischaracterized asylum seekers as â€œthreats and frauds.â€ â€œThese individuals are not criminals,â€ said senior director Eleanor Acer in a statement, â€œthey are mothers, teenagers, and children desperate to escape violence and persecution.â€ ",Real

Trump s new Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, even testified under oath that he had not spoke to Russian officials while working on Trump s campaign.And that lie just got exposed.Now high ranking Democrats including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Ranking Member of the House Oversight Committee Elijah Cummings have both called on Sessions to immediately step down. Pelosi s statement was a scorched earth condemnation of Sessions, Trump, and the entire administration which seems hell-bent on covering up its connections to Russia no matter what. Jeff Sessions lied under oath during his confirmation hearing before the Senate. Under penalty of perjury, he told the Senate Judiciary Committee,  I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians.  We know that statement is false.Attorney General Sessions has never had the credibility to oversee the FBI investigation of senior Trump officials  ties to the Russians. This is why Democrats have consistently called for Sessions to recuse himself from any oversight of the investigation.Now, after lying under oath about his own communications with the Russians, the Attorney General must resign. There must be an independent, bipartisan, outside commission to investigate the Trump political, personal, and financial connection to the Russians. Cummings was equally forceful in calling for Sessions to resign, citing the fact that Michael Flynn, Trump s disgraced former National Security Advisor, had already resigned for a similar offense and Sessions  was that much worse because he kept quiet about it even after that scandal.Sessions should have the self-respect to resign, because he may be also be facing a conviction.

"Trump anger at Cohn raises doubts about his White House tenure: sources BOSTON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A newly fraying relationship between U.S. President Donald Trump and top White House economic adviser Gary Cohn has raised questions about how long Cohn will stay in his job, say two people with close ties to the White House. Several sources said Cohn, director of the National Economic Council, had long planned to stay in his post for at least a year. But one source said concern had grown among Cohnâ€™s allies over the past 24 hours that he might be pressured to leave.  The recent concerns stem from a report in the Wall Street Journal â€“ confirmed by other news media, including Reuters â€“ that Cohn was unlikely to be nominated by Trump as a potential successor to Fed Chair Janet Yellen. Trump had mentioned Cohn in July for the job. Cohn resigned as president of Goldman Sachs to join the new administration. â€œThe calculus has shifted for Gary. Heâ€™s gone, essentially, from untouchable to possibly being bounced out,â€ the source said. â€œThe message is clear that suddenly Cohnâ€™s job in the White House has real downside risk.â€ Cohn crossed Trump last month when he criticized the president in a Financial Times interview for his response to the violence at a rally organized by white nationalists in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which one woman died. One source close to the White House said Trump wanted to fire Cohn. â€œHates him. But that could be ephemeral,â€ the source said. Cohn, who is Jewish, told the newspaper the administration â€œmust do betterâ€ in condemning neo-Nazis and white supremacists.  The former investment banker gave the interview after his wife and daughters pushed him to speak out, if not quit, after Trump blamed â€œboth sidesâ€ for the violence. Trump said there were â€œvery fine peopleâ€ among the white supremacist groups, a comment that disgusted Cohn and those close to him, people who know him said. While the interview was intended to signal that Cohn had no plans to leave the White House and planned to push ahead with his signature project, tax reform, sources said the comments upset Trump. Trump has gone hot and cold on other advisers, some of whom have stayed, while others have left. â€œRelationships change,â€ said a third source with close ties to the White House. â€œIf Gary sticks around, I fully expect that Garyâ€™s relationship with the president will improve.â€ People who know Cohn say that when he does leave the White House, he wants it to be on his own terms. A White House official said Cohn was focused on his job, especially tax reform. â€œGary is focused on his responsibilities as the director of the National Economic Council, including a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to deliver meaningful tax reform that creates jobs and grows the economy,â€ the official said. Cohn said in a CNBC interview last week he had a â€œgreat relationshipâ€ with Trump and the two were working well together.  ",Real

The Committee looks forward to receiving testimony from the former director on his role in the development of the Intelligence Community Assessment on Russian interference in the 2016 US elections, and I am hopeful that he will clarify for the American people recent events that have been broadly reported in the media,  Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) said in a statement.The walls are closing in on Mr. Trump. It appears that his son-in-law Jared Kushner is a  person of interest  in the Russia investigation.To his own detriment, Trump seems to be trying hard to bring an obstruction of justice case against himself. The former reality show star doesn t think before he tweets or speaks, nor does he think about who he s speaking to. Telling Russian officials that he fired Comey to relieve pressure from an investigation just screams  obstruction of justice. Trump must feel isolated after trashing his own staff with threats of shaking up the White House. His team defended him daily on news shows but now, they re MIA. He came at Comey, and karma is about to strike. Comey will testify and his father, a Republican, thinks Trump needs to be locked up in an institution. We hope Trump will be haunted forever by the  lock her up  chants ringing out at his rallies. Life comes at you fast.Photo by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images.",Fake
" Trump DESPERATE For Celebrities To Perform At His Inauguration, So Heâ€™s Doing This While his major qualification to be President of the United States was his status as a celebrity after hosting his reality TV show, The Apprentice, Donald Trump does not actually have a lot of contacts among real A-list celebrities. We first saw that on display during the Republican National Convention this summer, when the  celebrities  in attendance were a mix of the D-list, never were and  is he still alive  variety.Trump s inability to attract the big names now apparently extends to his upcoming inauguration, where the Trump team is now reportedly trying to bribe big names into coming on board out of sheer desperation.One talent manager described being offered  access to the administration  if he could lure major talent.  They said they were in the process of  figuring out posts, ambassadorships, and commissions  if that was of any interest,  he said.Another source also described receiving a  serious  ambassadorship offer, and that he was so shocked at the proposal that he almost dropped the phone.  Never in a million years have I heard something so crazy,  he said. Both declined the offers.Trump s team is denying the story, but the whiff of desperation echoes many of the strange things they ve been involved in already.Trump is going to have to try very hard to have even half of the star power in attendance at President Obama s two inaugurations. At his first, in 2009, Aretha Franklin sang a version of  My Country  Tis Of Thee  which will go down in history, then in 2013 Beyonc  sang the national anthem and brought down the house.For years people mocked the contestant on Trump s  Celebrity  Apprentice, pointing out that NBC often seemed to hire the people most likely to be sitting next to their telephone, but Trump may need to go back to the tape to pad out his inauguration guest list.Featured image via Wikimedia Commons/Flickr",Fake
" Trump Spokesman Reveals ASTONISHINGLY Racist Reason Kanye West Wasnâ€™t Invited To Inauguration Even after famously meeting with Donald Trump last month, and even after Trump has had an historically difficult time finding A-list musicians willing to debase themselves enough to perform at his inauguration, the planning committee said no to Kanye West as its star or anything else, and the reason is incredibly racist. He s not  traditionally American  enough. What in heaven s name could that mean, hmmmm?A spokesperson for president-elect Donald Trump s inauguration committee told CNN that Friend of Donald Kanye West was not invited to perform at the real estate mogul s inaugural because  Ye s music wasn t right for the  typically and traditionally American event.  Tom Barrack, chairman of the Presidential Inauguration Committee, told CNN s Erin Burnett that the inauguration wasn t a  fitting  venue for West, who famously met with Trump in December and posed for a stiff photo at Trump Tower afterwards and whose music is about to be the subject of a course at Washington University in St. Louis called  Politics of Kanye West: Black Genius and Sonic Aesthetics. He s been great, he considers himself a friend of the president-elect, but it s not the venue.  Kanye, who was born in Chicago and performs a style of music, hip-hop, that was invented in the United States on the streets of Trump s New York in the late 1970s, performed at MTV s Inaugural Youth Ball in honor of President Obama in 2009.  It s going to be typically and traditionally American, and Kanye is a great guy, we just haven t asked him to perform. And we move on with our agenda,  Barrack added.Source: BillboardHere s the video:Damn @kanyewest couldn t even get to perform at this friend @realDonaldTrump s inauguration b/c the event is  Traditionally American . pic.twitter.com/wu3EezncR2  Unstripped Voice (@UnstrippedVoice) January 18, 2017Looking over the list of inaugural entertainers, it s clear that  typically and traditionally American  means white, with a few exceptions. Most are country artists. There are a couple of African-American R&B singers, there s Travis Green, and there s an Indian-American DJ named RaviDrums. To give that extra-American oomph, Trump s ball will feature Irish dance.Trump may have done West a favor. After expressing his theoretical support for Trump (he didn t actually vote, but if he had voted ), West was forced to cancel his tour. We ll see if the D-list acts they ve managed to book suffer the same fates, assuming they re popular enough to currently be on tour.Featured image by Drew Angerer via Getty Images.",Fake
" Trump Jr.â€™s Lies About To Be EXPOSED; Meeting With Russian Lawyer Allegedly Recorded The entire weekend, and now the beginning of the week, has had the news cycle spinning madly with news of the meeting Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort had with a shady Russian lawyer during the 2016 presidential campaign. The plot has thickened as Trump Jr. s stories regarding the reasons for the meeting and the nature of the conversations that took place there kept changing. Finally, things really exploded on Tuesday, when Lord Cheeto s mini me was forced to tweet out the actual emails that led to this meeting   because if he hadn t the New York Times would have printed them for him. Said emails show that Trump Jr. knew he was meeting Russians for the explicit purpose of possibly gathering information that would damage the Clinton campaign.As if all of that isn t looking grim enough for Trump s eldest tyke, it seems that the meeting may have been recorded. Claude Taylor, who has worked on three Democratic presidential campaigns, tweeted out that potentially damning fact:A source with knowledge of the investigation tells me that IC had ""ears on"" Russian lawyer. The meeting was recorded. Donald, Jr is toast.  Claude Taylor (@TrueFactsStated) July 10, 2017Now, we all know that the Trumps routinely lie. They prove that all the time. Trump Jr. s story has changed radically over the course of the last few days alone. That in and of itself really should warrant scrutiny from the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, as well as Special Counsel Robert Mueller. In the meantime, Jared Kushner s security clearance needs to be revoked immediately, as he is a national security threat.As for Donald Trump Jr.   if this meeting really was recorded, Claude Taylor s tweet is correct. He s toast. He has put out false statement after false statement, and something tells me he s still not telling everything the way it really went down. It should only be a matter of time before the entire Trump criminal enterprise is in jail.Featured image via John Sommers II/Getty Images",Fake
" The Senate Just Quietly Passed A Measure To DESTROY Free Speech On College Campuses College campuses are one of the places where free speech is extremely sacrosanct, and for that reason, they re also often the target of censorship attempts from the government. Right now, campuses are under attack because they re hotbeds for opinions and movements that politicians can t stand, and the Senate has decided to try and stop that.The bill sounds innocuous at first. It s called the Anti-Semitism Awareness Act, and it s aimed at combating anti-Semitism, which has been on the rise thanks to Trump normalizing pretty much every form of bigotry there is. Combating anti-Semitism in the wake of his election through legislation is commendable.Combating it the way the Senate is doing, though, is not. What they saw in the rise of anti-Semitic sentiment and hate crimes here was not a real chance to address hate crimes and speech. They saw an opportunity to squash speech in favor of Palestinian rights in one of the places where it s strongest, and they pounced.This bill encourages the Department of Education to adopt the State Department s definition of anti-Semitism, which includes demonizing and delegitimizing Israel, applying double standards, and focusing on Israel only for human rights investigations.While the bill doesn t actually tell the Department of Education to use the language from the State Department, it does steer them in that direction. The Senate s hope seems to be that when they re investigating schools for anti-Semitic discrimination under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, they ll sanction schools with heavy anti-Israel sentiment.In fact, the definition is so broad that any speech criticizing Israel could be considered anti-Semitic hate speech, and thus, curbed lest the school get in trouble for daring to allow it.The Senate bill supposedly isn t meant to infringe on anyone s First Amendment right to criticize Israel, so long as they do it in the same way they would criticize any other nation. But we know how it ll actually be used. Groups like the Zionist Organization of America, AIPAC, the Anti-Defamation League, and the Jewish Federations of North America can t stand things like the BDS movement (boycott, divest and sanction) gaining steam. The Zionist Organization of America absolutely loves to file complaints with the Department of Education to try and silence any Palestinian rights speech on campus.That is only likely to increase if this bill becomes law. Students who fight for Palestine because Israel is guilty of murdering them for nothing, is guilty of forcing occupation and subjugating them, and is guilty of all manner of human rights abuses, already work in a heavily repressive environment. This will make that considerably worse.This has been simmering under the surface for a long time. Last year, Ted Cruz delivered a speech to AIPAC talking about how people involved with the BDS movement might end up in prison, depending on what s defined as legal and illegal protest behavior, and said that schools that support the BDS movement should lose their federal dollars.The University of California at Berkeley has faced tons of pressure to squash the BDS movement on their campus. And a student at George Washington University had campus police tell her to take a Palestinian flag out of her window.All of this is done under the idea that speech and expression in support of Palestinian rights are intimidating and frightening to Jewish students. However, a growing number of American Jews have a severe problem with how Israel abuses, oppresses and enslaves Palestine. Yes, it s a balancing act, but every right we have is a balancing act. In this case, the Senate wants to tip that balance towards censoring free speech. Do not expect them to stop there.The broader implication is that censoring pro-Palestine speech on college campuses could lead to censoring other speech on campuses. We do need to combat anti-Semitism along with other forms of hate. This, however, is just the Senate seeing their opening to end pro-Palestine speech on college campuses, likely with the hope that it ll die elsewhere.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images",Fake
" Itâ€™s Already Happening: DAPL Spews Oil From Multiple Leaks As Construction Continues Oil leaks that pose catastrophic risks to the environment, people and water were the reason thousands of protesters risked their lives to stop the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. Millions of others around the world showed their support for the protesters and the rights of all people to have access to clean water and a healthy environment.Tragically, the fears of clean water activists around the world are already coming true. The Associated Press reports the Dakota Access Pipeline has already spilled oil onto American soil three separate times   before it s even been fully constructed.According to the North Dakota Health Department, a leaky flange in a pipeline terminal spilled 84 gallons of oil on March 3, in Watford City. The spill was quickly contained and oil flow was stopped on site. According to the department, the contaminated soil and snow were removed and no waterways, people or wildlife were harmed.Two days later a leak of 20 gallons was reported in a rural area of Mercer County by the Federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. Again, they stated that no waterways, people or wildlife were harmed.The incident report faults a manufacturing defect as the caused a valve failure and the subsequent leak, which was isolated by closing valves upstream and downstream. All other valves were later inspected and given the OK.Despite the ETP insisting that the pipeline is safe, several native Dakota tribes still fear the future environmental havoc of this 1,200-mile pipeline that will start commercial operation on June 1st.The Standing Rock, Cheyenne River, Oglala Sioux and Yankton Tribes are still fighting to stop the pipeline from operating. They are currently working in court to convince a federal judge to shut it down.The pipeline leaked a third time on April 4th. Eighty-four gallons were spilled at a rural pump station in South Dakota. The SD Department of Environment and Natual Resources reported the spill to its online database but kept it quiet from the public. Apparently, the department s policy is to conduct a press release only if the spill  threatens waterways or public health. In the fight to stop the DAPL, attorneys and local Tribal leaders are using these leaks as evidence that additional environmental reviews are necessary before it becomes fully operational. We have always said it is not a matter of if, but when,  tribal attorney Jan Hasselman said after the South Dakota leak.  Pipelines spill and leak. It s just a fact. ",Fake
"Russian foreign minister: Trump team are people of action WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, on a visit to Washington, said on Wednesday that his discussions with people in the Trump administration persuaded him they were people of action who wanted to cut deals and solve problems. Speaking at a news conference in the Russian embassy in Washington, Lavrov said that his talks with U.S. officials had not covered the U.S. sanctions imposed on Russia over its role in the Ukraine conflict. He said the focus of his discussions had been on creating so-called de-escalation zones inside Syria. â€œNow our dialogue is free of the ideologization that was characteristic of the Obama administration,â€ Lavrov said. â€œThe Trump administration, and the president himself, and the Secretary of State, I was persuaded of this once again today, are people of action.â€ Lavrov said the administration officials â€œwant to reach agreements not for the sake of showing off their achievements in terms of ideological preferences, but to reach agreements into order to resolve specific issues.â€ ",Real
"Trump tax plan hits bump in Senate as Rand Paul weighs 'no' vote WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senate Republicans scrambled on Tuesday to ensure support for a budget resolution vital to President Donald Trumpâ€™s drive to overhaul the U.S. tax code, as one Republican fiscal hawk announced he might vote against the measure.  As the Senate opened debate on a fiscal year 2018 budget, Senator Rand Paul objected to spending levels that he said would exceed agreed caps by $43 billion, and called for spending reforms for so-called entitlement programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid health insurance programs. â€œI will not vote for the budget unless it keeps within the spending caps,â€ the Republican senator told reporters. In a conversation with Trump earlier on Tuesday, Paul said he told the Republican president: â€œIâ€™m all in. I want to be supportive. Iâ€™m a â€˜yesâ€™ vote. But we have to obey our own rules.â€ Senate Republican aides denied that the budget resolution exceeds federal spending caps set by the Budget Control Act of 2011. Paul said the excess spending was for overseas military operations, which aides said are not subject to caps.    The budget resolution already had a narrow path to passage in the Senate, where Democrats oppose the measures and Republicans have only a 52-48 majority. A â€œnoâ€ vote from Paul appeared to put the budget a single vote from failure, threatening to upend Trumpâ€™s drive for tax reform.  Another fiscal hawk, Senator Ted Cruz, has refused to disclose whether he would support the measure.   However, the Republican odds of passing a budget resolution improved unexpectedly when Senator Thad Cochran returned to the Senate despite an illness and said in a statement that he looked forward to â€œtaking part in the debate on the budget and tax cuts.â€ A day earlier, Cochranâ€™s office had said he would not be available this week. With Cochran in the Senate, Republicans can pass the measure even if they lose two votes.  The budget resolution is essential to Trumpâ€™s tax reform strategy because it would unlock a legislative tool known as reconciliation, which would allow Senate Republicans to pass a tax bill with a simple majority. Without it, a partisan tax bill would need 60 votes in the 100-member Senate and would almost certainly fail. The Republican effort had gained momentum on Monday when two other potential Senate Republican â€œnoâ€ votes - Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski - indicated they were leaning toward â€œyes.â€ Senator John McCain also said he would support the budget resolution.  After failing to overturn Obamacare earlier this year, Republicans fear they will face a backlash from constituents in next yearâ€™s congressional midterm elections if they are unable to pass legislation to cut taxes for businesses and individuals. Trump and top Republicans have proposed a plan to deliver up to $6 trillion in tax cuts over the next 10 years as part of a reform package that they say will boost economic growth and provide more jobs and higher wages.  Democrats, who criticize the Republican plan as a giveaway to the wealthy, will likely propose numerous amendments to the budget plan to prevent tax cuts for the rich and require legislation that would not expand the federal deficit.   â€œWeâ€™re talking about a major political party now working night and day on behalf of the top 0.1 percent,â€ Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, told Reuters on Tuesday. Both the Senate and the House of Representatives must agree on a budget resolution. The House has already approved a different version, so House and Senate Republicans would need to hammer out a unified version and pass it before reconciliation could take effect. ",Real

" Outgoing GOP Senator BLISTERS The â€˜Adult Daycare Centerâ€™ That Is Trumpâ€™s White House (TWEET) Senator Bob Corker (R-TN) has had enough of the chaos in Donald Trump s White House. He is so fed up, in fact, that he is choosing to retire rather than run for another term. Therefore, there is no political cost to pay for criticizing Trump, and boy is he taking advantage. First, Senator Corker called Trump unstable after the disastrous response to the white supremacist violence in Charlottesville. Then, he said that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Defense General James Mattis, and White House Chief of Staff General John Kelly are the only people standing between the United States of America and complete chaos. Now, Corker is going all in on Trump s childish Twitter habits.

Corker is clearly completely unleashed here and out of f*cks to give when it comes to Trump s unseemly and disgraceful behavior from the highest office in the land. This is important though, for another reason: The fact that likely his comrades in the Republican Party on Capitol Hill are feeling the same way, and simply can t say it for fear of alienating Trump s base and losing their Congressional majority. However, since Corker is leaving, he clearly doesn t care about any of that. This opens a door, though   the one that allows GOP lawmakers to say what they REALLY think of Trump.

"Voters in Maine approve expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare (Reuters) - Voters in Maine on Tuesday approved a ballot initiative to expand the stateâ€™s Medicaid program under Obamacare, sending a clear signal of support for the federal healthcare law to lawmakers in the state and Washington D.C.   The approval of the ballot question in Maine comes after Republicans in Washington failed several times over the last few months to pass legislation that would dismantle the Affordable Care Act, former President Barack Obamaâ€™s signature healthcare law. Maine has recently figured prominently in the nationâ€™s debate on how to reform healthcare. U.S. Senator Susan Collins, a moderate Republican from Maine, helped block her partyâ€™s efforts to repeal Obamacare this year, which angered President Donald Trump.  Maine, which becomes the first U.S. state to approve Medicaid expansion by ballot initiative, is one of 19 states that has not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.  About 60 percent of voters in Maine approved the ballot initiative, according to the Bangor Daily News newspaper.   Tuesdayâ€™s ballot asked Maine voters to approve or reject a plan to provide healthcare coverage under Medicaid for adults under the age of 65 with incomes at or below 138 percent of the federal poverty level, which in 2017 is about $16,000 for a single person and about $22,000 for a family of two.  The stateâ€™s Republican governor, Paul LePage, staunchly opposes expansion of federal health care insurance, vetoing legislation to do so on several occasions.   â€œIâ€™ve said it before, â€œfreeâ€ is very expensive to somebody,â€ LePage said in a radio address last week.   About 70,000 residents in Maine would be eligible for the stateâ€™s Medicaid program when and if state officials certify the results of the election. Lawmakers could vote to repeal or alter the referendum, much like they have recently for several citizen-initiated referendums, the Bangor Daily News reported.   â€œIt is now the responsibility and the duty of the governor and the legislature to fully and faithfully implement this law,â€ the stateâ€™s Speaker of the House, Sara Gideon, said in a statement.  The Legislatureâ€™s Office of Fiscal and Program Review in Maine estimated that expansion of Medicaid would cost the state about $55 million and bring in about $525 million of federal money to the state each year, according to the Bangor Daily News.

"U.S. appeals court hears arguments on Trump travel ban SEATTLE/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday wrestled with a bid by President Donald Trump to show that his latest travel ban targeting people from six Muslim-majority countries is legal. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals hearing in Seattle came two days after the U.S. Supreme Court allowed Trumpâ€™s travel ban to take effect while litigation over its ultimate validity unfolds.  The ban targets people from Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen seeking to enter the United States. The Republican president has said the travel ban is needed to protect the United States from terrorism. The state of Hawaii, however, challenged it in court, and a Honolulu federal judge said it exceeded Trumpâ€™s powers under immigration law. Trumpâ€™s ban also covers people from North Korea and certain government officials from Venezuela, but the lower courts had already allowed those provisions to go into effect. The same three judge 9th Circuit panel which limited a previous version of Trumpâ€™s ban heard arguments on Wednesday. Some of the judges appeared more cautious toward the idea of blocking the presidentâ€™s policy. Judge Michael Daly Hawkins asked Hawaiiâ€™s lawyers whether Trumpâ€™s latest proclamation is more sound than prior versions. The current one, he said, is based on specific findings that some foreign governments do not share enough information to properly vet immigrants.  â€œYou would trust Kim Jong Un to say this person is this person, you gotta let him in?â€ Hawkins said. Judge Ronald Gould said the court would issue a ruling â€œas soon as practicable.â€ Trump issued his first travel ban targeting several Muslim-majority countries in January, which caused chaos at airports and mass protests.  He issued a revised one in March after the first was blocked by federal courts.  That expired in September after a long court fight, and was replaced with the current version.  The ban has some exceptions. Certain people from each targeted country can still apply for a visa for tourism, business or education purposes, and any applicant can ask for an individual waiver. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is set to hear a separate challenge to the ban on Friday, and the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to ultimately decide the issue in the coming months.  ",Real
"Factbox: Five facts about Tom Cotton, Trump's likely pick for CIA WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Tom Cotton, a hawkish Iraq war veteran who has said he did not consider waterboarding to be torture, is likely to be chosen by President Donald Trump as the next leader of the Central Intelligence Agency amid a Cabinet shake-up, senior administration officials said. Here are five facts about the Arkansas Republican: - Cotton, 40, is a staunch Trump ally who has vigorously opposed the Iran nuclear deal. He served one term in the House of Representatives before being elected to the Senate in 2014 as part of a Republican wave. Cotton sits on the Intelligence Committee but has no experience managing a large organization. - Cotton has given a qualified endorsement of the intelligence communityâ€™s assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election to boost Trumpâ€™s prospects. â€œI have no doubts about the intelligence communityâ€™s assessment,â€ he said in an Oct. 5 interview with Washington Post columnist David Ignatius.  - Cotton wants to boost the defense budget, saying the U.S. military is in crisis, and has pointed to both Russia and China as growing threats. He accused Moscow of trying to divide NATO and said China was â€œseeking control over the Pacific Rim.â€  - A decorated Army veteran of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Cotton appeared to align himself with Trumpâ€™s support of waterboarding, saying he did not consider it torture. â€œWaterboarding isnâ€™t torture. We do waterboarding on our own soldiers in the military,â€ the former paratrooper told CNN in November 2016. Waterboarding, the practice of pouring water over someoneâ€™s face to simulate drowning as an interrogation tactic, was banned by Democratic President Barack Obama days after he took office in 2009. - Cotton is a graduate of Harvard University and Harvard Law School. A father of two, he has a reputation as a devoted family man who once apologized for being late for an intelligence hearing because he was tending to a baby in his office. ",Real
" While We Were Sleeping, Trump Declared Civil War I woke up this morning completely unfazed over the idea that Donald Trump had yet another overnight Twitter meltdown. After being skewered in the media over his repeated claims that millions of people voted illegally, which is the only reason he lost the popular vote, Trump vowed to investigate.I will be asking for a major investigation into VOTER FRAUD, including those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal and .  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017even, those registered to vote who are dead (and many for a long time). Depending on results, we will strengthen up voting procedures!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017All this, despite the fact that there is no voter fraud.Many, of course, are theorizing that Trump s Twitter tantrums are simply a distraction from his real disasters, and that s true, to a point, but when you dig a little deeper, you ll find something much, much more sinister; Trump is declaring Civil War and three things he s done over the last 24 hours prove it.While threatening to investigate voter fraud might be (and likely is) a distraction, it s more than a threat. It s very specific. He s going after only the states that he didn t win.During Wednesday s White House briefing, Press Secretary Sean Spicer was asked about Trump s false claim that millions of fraudulent votes cost him a victory in the popular vote. After that lie was ridiculed Tuesday, Trump tweeted early Wednesday morning that he would order a  major investigation  into voter fraud. But the claim is not just unsupported by any evidence it was contradicted by his own campaign lawyers, who argued there was no evidence of fraud when Green Party nominee Jill Stein sued for a recount in some states. Why should anyone believe him now?Spicer s answer was stunning. There s a lot of states that we didn t compete in where that s not necessarily the case,  he said. You look at California and New York, I m not sure that those statements were we didn t look at those two states in particular   I think when you look at where a lot of places where a lot of these issues could have occurred in bigger states, that s where I think we re going to look. Source: The AtlanticThe second shot fired in the Civil War is against sanctuary cities, or cities where undocumented immigrants can report crimes committed against them without fear of legal retribution. Most of those cities, not surprisingly, are heavily Democratic. Trump signed an executive order that would take away federal funding from states that don t make life a living hell for undocumented immigrants. The majority of sanctuary cities are in firmly blue states, but we ll be curious to see if Trump s threat will come to fruition in red states.The third was on a smaller scale, but in its way, far more frightening. On Tuesday night, Trump quoted some Bill O Reilly statistics and said that he was going to  send in the Feds  to deal with Chicago s violence (Chicago, by the way, doesn t even crack the top 30 in most murderous cities).If Chicago doesn t fix the horrible  carnage  going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016), I will send in the Feds!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017We re still unclear about what  send in the feds  actually means, but the implication is that Trump intends to declare martial law and it might be over a petty feud with Chicago s mayor, Rahm Emanuel. Illinois is also a state that voted for Hillary Clinton.In another time, Republicans would be furious! What Trump is threatening violates state sovereignty. No president has ever won 100 percent of the vote, but we ve never had a president who s threatened those who dared vote against him. We ve especially never had a president who threatened martial law over a political dispute. It s also a violation of the Posse Comitatus Act, which forbids federal troops from acting as local police except under cases of extreme emergency.

"Highlights: The Trump presidency on April 21 at 6:12 p.m. EDT/2212 GMT (Reuters) - Highlights for U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s administration on Friday: Trump promises a big announcement about tax reform next week and orders an administration review of Obama-era tax rules written to discourage U.S. companies from relocating overseas to cut their tax bills. Trump tells the Treasury Department to examine two powers given to regulators to police large financial companies following the 2008 financial crisis. South Korea says it is on heightened alert ahead of another important anniversary in North Korea, with a large concentration of military hardware amassed on both sides of the border amid concerns about a new nuclear test by Pyongyang. Trump, striving to make good on a top campaign promise, is pushing fellow Republicans who control Congress to pass revamped healthcare legislation but the same intraparty squabbling that torpedoed it last month could do it again. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis says Syria has dispersed its warplanes in recent days and that it retains chemical weapons, an issue he says will have to be taken up diplomatically. The Department of Justice threatens to cut off funding to California as well as eight cities and counties across the United States, escalating a Trump administration crackdown on so-called â€œsanctuary citiesâ€ that do not cooperate with federal immigration authorities. The United States will not make an exception for American companies, including oil major Exxon Mobil Corp, seeking to drill in areas prohibited by U.S. sanctions on Russia, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says.  Trump and his fellow Republicans who control Congress face their first major budget test next week, with the threat of a government shutdown potentially hinging on his proposed Mexican border wall as well as Obamacare funding. The House of Representatives Intelligence Committee says it has invited FBI, National Security Agency and Obama administration officials to testify as it restarts its investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres meets with Trump at the White House for the first time since both took office earlier this year and amid a U.S. push to cut funding to the world body and its agencies. The United States has offered to help fund Mexicoâ€™s efforts to eradicate opium poppies, a U.S. official says, as Mexican heroin output increased again last year. ",Real
" Elizabeth Warren Just SHREDDED Trump For Being A â€˜Sore Loserâ€™ Before Election Is Even Over Have you noticed that Donald Trump has opted to not attack or retaliate against Elizabeth Warren for quite some time? That s because the Massachusetts Senator is a professional truth teller whose epic tweetstorms put the Republican nominee in his place each and every time.Indeed, every time Trump has insulted Warren on Twitter she has absolutely destroyed him. But Warren didn t shred Trump this time over mere insults against her. She did it because Trump is trying to undermine our democratic system by calling the election  rigged  against him.Despite the fact that study after study encompassing many years and over one billion votes has found that voter fraud is exceedingly rare in our country, Trump has repeatedly claimed that the media and Hillary Clinton have fixed the election in her favor.Well, Warren has something to say about Trump s whining and she used strong words to call him out, calling him a  sore loser  who is acting like a petulant child who isn t getting their way.Give me a break, @realDonaldTrump.

"North Carolina lawmakers reach deal to repeal transgender bathroom law (Reuters) - North Carolina Republican lawmakers said late on Wednesday they had reached a deal to repeal the stateâ€™s controversial law prohibiting transgender people from using restrooms in accordance with their gender identities. The compromise, reached with Democratic Governor Roy Cooper and set to go before the legislature for a vote Thursday morning, would still ban local municipalities, schools and others from regulating bathroom access. It would also effectively forbid cities from offering their own job and restroom protections to vulnerable groups for nearly four years. â€œCompromise requires give and take from all sides, and we are pleased this proposal fully protects bathroom safety and privacy,â€ the stateâ€™s top Republican lawmakers, Senate leader Phil Berger and House of Representatives Speaker Tim Moore, said in a statement released late Wednesday. The pair announced the deal at an impromptu news conference. The compromise with Cooper, a staunch opponent of the bathroom law, was reached hours before the state was reportedly set to lose its ability to host any NCAA basketball championships.  The college athletic association is one of numerous organizations to sanction or boycott North Carolina in the wake of the lawâ€™s passage last year. Cooper said earlier this week that the measure could end up costing the state nearly $4 billion. He said he supported the compromise. â€œItâ€™s not a perfect deal, but it repeals House Bill 2 and begins to repair our reputation.â€ But it remained unclear whether the compromise would be acceptable to those who believe North Carolina was unfriendly to the rights of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people. In an impassioned news conference before the deal was announced, several leading LGBT activists decried its provisions, including the bar on municipalities regulating employment practices and â€œpublic accommodationsâ€. â€œThis is a dirty deal,â€ said Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign. He vowed to continue fighting North Carolina in court and in the public sphere if the new measure passes and is signed by Cooper. On Twitter Wednesday night, San Francisco-based Levi Strauss & Co., which has publicly opposed North Carolinaâ€™s transgender bathroom law, urged lawmakers to reject what it called a â€œbackroomâ€ deal.    (This version of the story corrects Griffin quote in paragraph 12, replacing â€œbillâ€ with â€œdealâ€) ",Real
" Trump Wants To Spend Most Of His Term Going On Vacation And Playing Golf Since Republicans had such a problem with President Obama going on vacation and playing golf, they ll be totally opposed to Donald Trump doing even more of both, right?Because while President Obama and his family moved into the White House and took less vacation time than any Republican president in the last 40 years, it looks like Trump wants to spend much of his term playing golf or relaxing at his gold-plated apartment in Trump Tower.According to The New York Times,Mr. Trump, a homebody who often flew several hours late at night during the campaign so he could wake up in his own bed in Trump Tower, is talking with his advisers about how many nights a week he will spend in the White House. He has told them he would like to do what he is used to, which is spending time in New York when he can.The questions reflect what Mr. Trump s advisers described as the president-elect s coming to grips with the fact that his life is about to change radically. They say that Mr. Trump, who was shocked when he won the election, might spend most of the week in Washington, much like members of Congress, and return to Trump Tower or his golf course in Bedminster, N.J., or his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach on weekends.In other words, Trump isn t interested in being president full-time. He wants to vacation and golf. And if he gets the schedule he wants, he would end up spending 416 days away from Washington over the course of four years. Far MORE days than the 217 days President Obama spent on vacation in eight years.And that s not even counting official vacations Trump will likely take.Furthermore, if Trump plays one round of golf every weekend, he will play more golf in two years than President Obama played during his whole first term.So while Trump is away, it s likely the responsibility of governing will be left to his advisers and cabinet members.If Donald Trump is serious about governing, he should be in Washington full-time. Also, he should never take a vacation or play a single round of golf during his term because for years, Trump and his supporters bitched every time President Obama left the White House for just about any little thing. And they definitely despised him for playing golf. Doing either of these things would make Trump a hypocrite, especially since he could end up doing more of it over four years than Obama did in eight.Featured Image: Ian MacNicol/Getty Images",Fake
"New York attorney general looking at Eric Trump charity's payouts (Reuters) - New Yorkâ€™s attorney general is looking into a report that the Eric Trump Foundation funneled more than $1 million from charity golf tournaments into President Donald Trumpâ€™s business, a spokesman for the attorney general said on Friday. Forbes magazine reported this week that the charity run by Eric Trump, the presidentâ€™s second-oldest son, paid the Trump Organization to use its properties for charity events in recent years even though Eric Trump had told donors that the golf course and other assets were being used for free, so that just about all the money donated would help sick children. Forbes reported that based on filings from the Eric Trump Foundation and other charities, more than $1.2 million â€œhas no documented recipients past the Trump Organization.â€ Eric Soufer, a spokesman for New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, said in an email that his office was looking into issues raised by the Forbes story. Soufer did not immediately respond to a later request for details about the examination. The Democratic attorney generalâ€™s office already is investigating allegations of self-dealing at the Donald J. Trump Foundation, the Republican presidentâ€™s charity. Trump, a New York real estate developer, said in December that he would dissolve the Donald J. Trump Foundation, but Schneidermanâ€™s office has said it could not be wound down while the investigation was ongoing. Forbes also reported that although donors to the Eric Trump Foundation were told all its money was going to help St. Jude Childrenâ€™s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, fight pediatric cancer, more than $500,000 was re-donated to other charities. Many of those charities â€œwere connected to Trump family members or interests, including at least four groups that subsequently paid to hold golf tournaments at Trump courses,â€ Forbes said. Amanda Miller, who works for the Trump Organization and who identified herself in an emailed response to a Reuters query as a â€œspokesperson for Eric Trump,â€ said the Eric Trump Foundation would cooperate fully with Schneidermanâ€™s office. Eric Trump is executive vice president of development and acquisition for the Trump Organization. â€œDuring the past decade, the Eric Trump Foundation has raised over $16.3 million for St. Jude Childrenâ€™s Research Hospital, including more than $3.6 million to St. Jude and other worthwhile causes just in 2016 alone,â€ Miller said in the email. Eric Trump said in a tweet on Thursday that he had raised the money for St. Jude with an expense ratio of less than 12.3 percent. â€œLetâ€™s not politicize pediatric cancer,â€ he said. On his foundationâ€™s website, Eric Trump said he had ceased  direct fundraising efforts at the end of 2016 â€œin order to avoid the appearance or assertion of any impropriety and/or a conflict of interest.â€ ",Real
" WATCH: Trump Tries To Kiss Little Girl On The Lips And She Is NOT Thrilled About It Donald Trump is seriously stupid.Considering all of the sexual assault allegations against him, the fact that he wants to bang his daughter, the fact that he has hit on teen girls, and talked about dating a girl when she was just ten-years old, one would think Trump would know better than to bring a girl on stage at one of his rallies.But that s exactly what he did on Monday night when he invited the child to the podium. Trump then picked her up, told her how beautiful she is and then tried to kiss her repeatedly, including on the lips, which the girl clearly did NOT appreciate. You can see it on her face as she tries to avoid Trump s lips and then runs back to her parents.Here s the video via YouTube.The optics here are absolutely terrible. If Trump had done this a year ago this probably wouldn t be much of a story. But we are three weeks out from Election Day and Donald Trump is embroiled in a mountain of sexual assault allegations and is still experiencing fallout because of his comments about groping women and not waiting to kiss women he considers  beautiful.  Apparently, that disgusting personal policy includes little girls, too.Of course, Trump trying to kiss a little girl horrified America, and they let Trump know about it on Twitter.About the gross video of Trump trying to kiss a little girl against her will: I don t even try to hug my daughter when she s not feeling it.

" Twitter DESTROYS Trump After He Whines That Eric Canâ€™t Sell Access To His Administration (TWEETS) In case you haven t heard, Eric Trump recently had to cancel an auction in which he was using his charity as a front to sell access to his father s administration. Recently the Eric Trump Foundation announced an auction for coffee with his sister, incoming First Lady Ivanka, who will be serving as an adviser to her father and occupying the space in the White House normally reserved for the President s spouse.To any casual onlooker, this is exactly the sort of situation that used to cause Trump to scream  lock her up,  but now that he s President, the obvious conflict of interest presented by the sale of access to those closest to the President-elect doesn t matter much to him. On Friday, The Donald took to Twitter to whine that his family can t sell access to his administration:My wonderful son, Eric, will no longer be allowed to raise money for children with cancer because of a possible conflict of interest with  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 23, 2016my presidency. Isn't this a ridiculous shame? He loves these kids, has raised millions of dollars for them, and now must stop. Wrong answer!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 23, 2016Now, nothing is stopping any of the Trumps from donating their own money, or encouraging direct donations to St. Jude, the organization that was allegedly going to receive the money (anytime the Trumps and charity are mentioned,  allegedly  is appropriate until it actually happens). But for them to think it is in any way OK to sell access to Ivanka no matter the reason is just asinine. It s conflicts like this that caused Obama to prohibit members of his family from directly raising money for anyone, no matter the cause:The Obama administration prohibited any member of the first family from directly soliciting charitable donations, said Norm Eisen, who served as an ethics lawyer early in President Obama s tenure. Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, have attended occasional charitable fund-raising events, including the Congressional Black Caucus annual dinners. The Obamas also allowed their daughters  high school to auction off magazines they had signed, Mr. Eisen said, but they did not auction off access to themselves. You never, ever want to have government officials using their public office for the private gain, even for a worthy charity,  Mr. Eisen said.  That was how we did it. Eric Trump, like his father, whined that he can t raise money by selling his sister despite getting by just fine without that sort of thing in the past. I get that people will try to use anything they can for their own interests,  Trump said.  The reality is, I ve been raising money for sick kids far longer than  his dad has been involved in politics,  Eric Trump told the New York Times, though he did explain that he understands  the quagmire  presented by what he had hoped he would not get caught doing.Naturally, in what is almost becoming a daily ritual, Twitter swarmed Trump s morning bloviating whinefest and once again hammered him into oblivion:@realDonaldTrump Sorry your children can't get the tax deduction on your name.

The Daily Beast reports:Though the Eric Trump Foundation s website says,  We exclusively support St. Jude Children s Research Hospital,  that isn t the case. In 2012, ETF began donating in earnest to other causes, cutting small checks to 40 individual charities in addition to the outsize donation given to the children s hospital. Some of these small donations like the $1,600 to the American Society for Enology and Viticulture, a California wine industry organization where Eric Trump once gave a keynote address have seemingly little to do with the charity s mission of helping sick children.By 2013, it had given $15,000 to The Little Baby Face Foundation, a controversial charity run by a Manhattan plastic surgeon that provides surgery for children with big noses, large ears, and other more serious facial deformities so they can face bullies at school one which critics have warned sends a warped message to such young children.Despite the claim that all the gifts in ETF s silent auction would be donated, the foundation also paid $25,000 to an artist s foundation in exchange for a portrait of Donald Trump that was sold at the 2012 Golf Invitational to Eric Trump, who hung it over his livingroom sofa. Eric Trump did not respond to a request for comment seeking the purchase price.Would the money have actually gone to St. Jude? There s truly no way of knowing given the previous lies and shady dealings   but it is never OK for the President s family to sell access, period.Featured image via screengrab/Getty Images (Jeff J.

"Trump administration tells court law does not ban bias against gay workers (Reuters) - A Trump administration lawyer on Tuesday urged a U.S. appeals court in Manhattan to rule that federal law does not ban discrimination against gay employees. The U.S. Department of Justice is supporting a New York skydiving company, Altitude Express Inc, in a lawsuit brought by former instructor Donald Zarda, who accused the company of firing him after he told a customer he was gay and she complained. Zarda died in a BASE-jumping accident after filing the lawsuit, and his estate took over the case. Judges on the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals focused their questions on whether discrimination against gay workers is a form of unlawful sex bias under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. That law bans discrimination based on workersâ€™ sex, race, religion and other traits.   Justice Department lawyer Hashim Mooppan told the court that Congress never intended for that law to protect gay workers against bias. And in recent years, he said, lawmakers have repeatedly declined to pass bills that would prohibit employment discrimination against gay workers.  During the Obama administration, the Justice Department had not weighed in on the case. But the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which appeared at Tuesdayâ€™s hearing on behalf of Zardaâ€™s estate, has been arguing for five years that bias against gay workers violates the law. The EEOC is an independent federal agency that enforces Title VII.  So far, only one federal appeals court, in Chicago, has agreed with the commission.  Several 2nd Circuit judges questioned Mooppan about why the Justice Department got involved, and whether it first consulted with the EEOC. Mooppan said it would not be appropriate for him to discuss the departmentâ€™s internal procedures. Lawyers for Zardaâ€™s estate and the EEOC told the court gay workers are protected by Title VII because sexual orientation is necessarily linked to a personâ€™s sex.  LGBT groups say the case is crucial because a victory for Zardaâ€™s estate would deepen a split among federal appeals courts and increase the chances that the U.S. Supreme Court will take up the issue. Earlier this month, the high court was asked to review a ruling that dismissed a similar case by a former hospital security guard in Georgia. A three-judge 2nd Circuit panel in April had ruled against Zardaâ€™s estate, citing a prior ruling that said discrimination against gay workers is not a form of sex bias. The full court can overturn the prior decision. The case is Zarda v. Altitude Express Inc, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 15-3775. ",Real
"With Obamacare vote, House Republicans free to turn to tax reform WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives plans to turn to tax reform in earnest, after concluding a lengthy healthcare debate this week with a vote to repeal and replace Obamacare.  But even as Republicans predicted that tax reform would succeed before year-end, lawmakers encountered new uncertainties about what a final tax package might contain, as well as doubts about whether Republicans will be able to enact reforms without Democratic help. President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress have pledged to complete the biggest tax reform since 1986, when President Ronald Reagan was in office, before the end of 2017. But they face an uphill battle, mainly over policy differences within their own ranks.  Thursdayâ€™s 217-213 House vote on healthcare legislation raised confidence in the Republican-controlled chamberâ€™s ability to move major legislation after two earlier pushes ended in failure. But to move forward on tax reform, the House, Senate and Trump administration must agree on where to set tax rates, how to pay for cuts and whether the final package should add to the deficit or pay for itself, all areas where common ground may be hard to find. A plan to enact reforms without Democratic support will also require Republicans to pass a 2018 budget authorizing the parliamentary process known as reconciliation. But a new budget agreement poses a daunting task given Republican opposition to Trump demands for deep domestic spending cuts.   â€œThat may prove to be one, if not the most difficult votes of the tax reform process,â€ Jonathan Traub, a managing principal at the consulting firm Deloitte Tax LLP.   Meanwhile, the need to reach agreement between the House, Senate and White House will likely delay introduction of a tax reform bill, which had been expected in early June.  But Republicans say it will ultimately make it easier to enact reforms before the end of the year.  The House Ways and Means Committee, which will unveil the initial tax bill, is still aiming for a revenue-neutral package that raises $2.4 trillion for tax cuts through a new border adjustment tax and elimination of business deductions for net interest payments, both controversial measures. Panel chairman Kevin Brady told reporters that revenue neutrality is necessary to ensure bold, permanent changes to tax policy that can drive economic growth.   â€œThatâ€™s the argument and the case weâ€™re going to make to the Senate and the Trump administration,â€ he said. But Representative Mark Meadows, who chairs the conservative Freedom Caucus that helped block Trumpâ€™s first healthcare bill,  voiced opposition to a revenue neutral approach. â€œIf itâ€™s revenue neutral, youâ€™re not really lowering taxes. Youâ€™re shifting the burden,â€ Meadows told reporters.       The Trump tax plan unveiled last week calls for steep tax cuts financed by government revenues that officials say will result from higher growth. Some fear the plan could add trillions of dollars to the deficit if growth does not materialize. Meadows said tax cuts should be offset by cuts to entitlement programs including Social Security and Medicare, which Trump has promised not to touch. ",Real

"Students protest U.S. Attorney General speech at Georgetown WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Students and faculty at Georgetown Law School gathered on Tuesday to protest that U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions was delivering an address about the right of free speech on college campuses to an invitation-only audience without giving critics of the Trump administration an opportunity to ask questions. Several dozen protesters stood on the front steps of the school, some with duct tape over their mouths to symbolize that they felt their views were censored from the event. Some held signs denouncing racism, censorship and U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s decision to rescind â€œDACA,â€ the Obama administrationâ€™s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy that shields immigrants who were brought to the United State as children. Taking turns with a bullhorn, students and some faculty members accused the school of shutting them out from attending the speech and asking questions.  In his address, Sessions focused on concerns about whether the rights of speakers on college campuses were being trampled by student protesters who find their views offensive. Sessions complained that protesters were silencing speakers. He also said the department plans to file a brief in a college free speech case this week. Protesters â€œare now routinely shutting down speeches and debates across the country in an effort to silence voices that insufficiently conform with their views,â€ he said. One protester, third-year law student Charlotte Berschback, complained on the sidelines of the protest that invitations to the Sessions speech had been withdrawn from students who had RSVPed and had initially been told they would have a seat. â€œWe pay a ton of tuition,â€ she said. â€œWe should have a role in deciding who comes to our school.â€ She added that liberal students had been excluded from attending the Sessions event and that the school should have used a lottery process to let students attend. Sessions cited concerns about multiple incidents at college campuses around the country, including the University of California at Berkeley and Middlebury College in Vermont. Sessions mentioned recent violent protests at Berkeley.

"MSNBC hosts accuse White House of trying to pressure them over coverage WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two television hosts assailed by Donald Trump questioned his mental health on Friday and charged that the White House had tried unsuccessfully to get them to apologize to the president for unfavorable coverage in exchange for his getting a negative tabloid story about them killed. â€œHe appears to have a fragile, impetuous, child-like ego that weâ€™ve seen over and over again, especially with women,â€ Mika Brzezinski, co-host of MSNBCâ€™s â€œMorning Joe,â€ said on the program. â€œHe attacks women because he fears women,â€ added co-host Joe Scarborough, a former Republican U.S. congressman. Brzezinski and Scarborough fired back on their program and in an opinion piece in The Washington Post after Trumpâ€™s Twitter messages on Thursday, which attacked them, particularly Brzezinski, in highly personal terms. Trump called Brzezinski â€œlow I.Q. Crazy Mikaâ€ and alleged that she was â€œbleeding badly from a face-liftâ€ when she visited his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida around New Yearâ€™s Eve. He called Scarborough â€œPsycho Joe.â€ Scarborough said Trump packed â€œfive or six lies into two tweets,â€ including mischaracterizing their meetings at Mar-a-Lago. Brzezinski said she has never had a face-lift. Presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway, speaking on ABCâ€™s â€œGood Morning America,â€ defended Trumpâ€™s â€œability to fight back when he is attacked.â€ She declined to endorse the content of his tweets. â€œWell itâ€™s incredible to watch people play armchair psychologist, outright ridiculing the presidentâ€™s physicalities, his mental state, calling him names that you wonâ€™t want your children to call people on a playground,â€ Conway told Fox News. Trumpâ€™s tweets, his latest attacks on the U.S. news media, were roundly condemned by lawmakers in both parties and became a distraction as his fellow Republicans in the Senate try to iron out their differences over major healthcare legislation. Brzezinski and Scarborough, who were on friendly terms with Trump in the past but have been critical of him since he took office in January, described White House pressure over a planned negative story about them in the National Enquirer tabloid newspaper.  Trump was friends with David Pecker, chief executive of the National Enquirerâ€™s parent company, American Media, Inc. The tabloid specializes in scandalous stories about celebrities and has been supportive of Trump.  â€œThis year, top White House staff members warned that the National Enquirer was planning to publish a negative article about us unless we begged the president to have the story spiked. We ignored their desperate pleas,â€ they wrote in the Post. Scarborough said on the program he received calls from three top administration officials asking the co-hosts to call Trump and apologize for their coverage of his administration. They told him that if he called and apologized, Trump would get the story killed, Scarborough said. He did not identify the administration officials. â€œThe calls kept coming, and kept coming. And they were like â€˜Call, you need to call. Please call. Come on, Joe. Just pick up the phone and call him,â€™â€ Scarborough said. â€œThatâ€™s blackmail,â€ said MSNBC panelist Donny Deutsch. In a Twitter post on Friday, Trump gave a different account, saying Scarborough â€œcalled me to stop a National Enquirer article. I said no!â€ American Media said in a statement â€œwe have no knowledge of any discussions between the White House and Joe and Mika about our story, and absolutely no involvement in those discussions.â€ â€œI am very concerned as to what this once again reveals about the president of the United States,â€ Brzezinski, who is engaged to be married to Scarborough, said of Trumpâ€™s Twitter attacks. â€œPresident Trump launched personal attacks against us Thursday, but our concerns about his unmoored behavior go far beyond the personal. Americaâ€™s leaders and allies are asking themselves yet again whether this man is fit to be president,â€ the co-hosts wrote in the Post column. ",Real
"Trump firing of FBI Director Comey evokes criticism, praise WASHINGTON (Reuters) - After U.S. President Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday, Democratic members of Congress denounced the move and renewed calls for an independent investigation of alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. Democrats likened the dismissal to President Richard Nixonâ€™s firing of an independent special prosecutor during the Watergate investigation and discounted Trumpâ€™s contention that the move was related to the Federal Bureau of Investigation probe of the emails of Hillary Clinton, Trumpâ€™s rival for the presidency. Some Republicans defended the firing, saying new leadership was needed at the law enforcement agency. Here are reactions from Democrats and Republicans to Comeyâ€™s firing: â€œNo one should accept President Trumpâ€™s absurd justification that he is now concerned that FBI Director Comey treated Secretary Clinton unfairly. ... This is nothing less than Nixonian.â€ - Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy  â€œTodayâ€™s action by President Trump completely obliterates any semblance of an independent investigation into Russian efforts to influence our election and places our nation on the verge of a constitutional crisis.â€ - Democratic Representative John Conyers  â€œGiven the recent controversies surrounding the director, I believe a fresh start will serve the FBI and the nation well.â€ - Republican Senator Lindsey Graham  â€œThis is Nixonian. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein must immediately appoint a special counsel to continue the Trump/Russia investigation.â€ -Democratic Senator Bob Casey  â€œI am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Director Comeyâ€™s termination ... His dismissal, I believe, is a loss for the bureau and the nation.â€ - Republican Senator Richard Burr, head of the Senate committee investigating Russia role in the election â€œThe decision ... raises profound questions about whether the White House is brazenly interfering in a criminal matter ... The same president who has called the investigation into the Russian hacking of our democracy and the potential complicity of his campaign a â€˜fake,â€™ cannot pretend to have made such a decision uninfluenced by his concerns over Comeyâ€™s continued involvement in the investigation.â€ - Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House committee looking into possible Russian connections â€œAny suggestion that todayâ€™s announcement is somehow an effort to stop the FBIâ€™s investigation of Russiaâ€™s attempt to influence the election last fall is misplaced. The president did not fire the entire FBI; he fired the director.â€ - Republican Senator Susan Collins â€œEarlier this afternoon, President Trump called me and informed me he was firing Director Comey. I told the president: â€˜Mr. President, with all due respect, you are making a big mistakeâ€™ ... Given the way the president has fired Director Comey, any person who he appoints to lead the Russia investigation will be concerned that he or she will meet the same fate as Director Comey if they run afoul of the administration.â€ - Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer in remarks to reporters â€œThere is now a crisis of confidence at the Justice Department and President Trump is not being held accountable because House Republicans refuse to work with us to do our job.â€ - Democratic Representative Elijah Cummings, who called for immediate emergency hearings â€œMany, including myself, have questioned his actions more than once over the past year. I believe new leadership at the FBI will restore confidence in the organization and among the people who do the hard work to carry out its mission.â€ - Republican Senator Roy Blunt in a statement â€œThe presidentâ€™s actions today are shocking. ... The only way this administration can begin to demonstrate a commitment to the rule of law ... is to cooperate fully with the ongoing congressional investigations and to support the appointment of an independent special counsel.â€ - Democratic Senator Mark Warner  â€œThis FBI director has sought for years to jail me on account of my political activities. If I can oppose his firing, so can you.â€ - Fugitive former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, who leaked intelligence documents and is now living in Russia, on Twitter â€œOver the course of the last several months, Director Comeyâ€™s decisions on controversial matters have prompted concern from across the political spectrum and from career law enforcement experts.â€ - Republican Senator Charles Grassley  â€œThere can be no question that a fully independent special counsel must be appointed to lead this (Russia) investigation. At this point, no one in Trumpâ€™s chain of command can be trusted to carry out an impartial investigation.â€ - Democratic Senator Ron Wyden on Twitter â€œI find it deeply troubling that this decision comes a day after damning testimony by former acting Attorney General Sally Yates on Russiaâ€™s ties to the Trump campaign and just days before Comey was scheduled to appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee.â€ - Independent Senator Bernie Sanders  â€œIt is essential that ongoing investigations are fulsome and free of political interference until their completion, and it is imperative that President Trump nominate a well-respected and qualified individual to lead the bureau at this critical time.â€ - Republican Senator Bob Corker  â€œJames Comey is a man of honor and integrity ... I have long called for a special congressional committee to investigate Russiaâ€™s interference in the 2016 election. The presidentâ€™s decision to remove the FBI director only confirms the need and the urgency of such a committee.â€  - Republican Senator John McCain  â€œThe need for a special prosecutor is now crystal clear. President Trump has catastrophically compromised the FBIâ€™s ongoing investigation of his own White Houseâ€™s ties to Russia. Not since Watergate have our legal systems been so threatened.â€ - Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal  â€œMr. Comey did not seem to understand some of the laws he was asked to investigate and unfortunately politicized his sensitive position as the FBI director.â€ - Conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch â€œFUN FACT: President Nixon never fired the Director of the FBI #FBIDirector #notNixonianâ€ - Official Twitter account of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum ",Real
" Reince Priebus To Top GOP: Endorse Trump Or Your Career Is Over (VIDEO) Several top Republicans have yet to endorse Donald Trump as the GOP presidential nominee. On Sunday, Republican National Committee chair Reince Priebus had some strong words for those individuals. Appearing on CBS  Face the Nation, Priebus issued a thinly veiled threat directed towards those who have yet to get on board the Trump bandwagon, which Reince described as one of the  biggest movements as far as people across this country in modern history. The right-wing reactionary movement is missing key GOP politicians such as Ted Cruz and other former presidential hopefuls. While they may not be considered a part of the #NeverTrump crowd, these GOPers have not really done much of anything to support the current Republican presidential candidate.They all agreed to support the eventual presidential nominee no matter who wins the election, and Priebus is expecting them to put party before country. We re a private party. We re not a public entity. Those people need to get on board,  Priebus told the show s host, John Dickerson.  And if they re thinking they re going to run again someday, I think we re going to evaluate the nomination process, and I don t think it s going to be that easy for them. I think these are things that our party s going to look at in the process. I think people who gave us their word, used information from the RNC, should get on board. What s interesting is that Trump has previously dragged his feet when it comes to endorsing other GOP candidates, such as House Speaker Paul Ryan. It s also interesting to note that the pledge that Priebus is referencing was reportedly designed to discourage Trump from running as an independent or on a non-establishment party campaign. It has no legal significance and is simply just a promise.The fact that Priebus, had to threaten   though he insists that his comments are not a threat top members of his Party show that the GOP is still cracking under the weight of trying to hold up Trump s campaign.

"Islamic State says New York truck attacker is 'caliphate soldier' NEW YORK (Reuters) - Islamic State has claimed responsibility for a truck attack this week that killed eight people in the deadliest assault on New York City since Sept. 11, 2001. The militant group on Thursday described accused attacker Sayfullo Saipov, 29, as â€œone of the caliphate soldiersâ€ in a weekly issue of its Al-Naba newspaper. The Uzbek immigrant was charged in federal court on Wednesday with acting in support of Islamic State by plowing a rented pickup truck down a popular riverside bike trail, crushing pedestrians and cyclists and injuring a dozen people in addition to those killed.     According to the criminal complaint against him, Saipov told investigators he was inspired by watching Islamic State propaganda videos on his cellphone, felt good about what he had done, and asked for permission to display the groupâ€™s flag in his hospital room in New York. Saipov was taken to Bellevue after being shot in the abdomen by a police officer before his arrest.  U.S. President Donald Trump, who has called for Saipov to receive the death penalty, said on Twitter on Friday that Islamic State had claimed as their soldier the â€œDegenerate Animalâ€ who killed and wounded â€œthe wonderful people on the West Sideâ€ of Lower Manhattan. â€œBased on that, the Military has hit ISIS â€œmuch harderâ€ over the last two days. They will pay a big price for every attack on us!â€ Trump tweeted. In the Middle East the Islamic Stateâ€™s self-proclaimed caliphate looked to be on the verge of defeat on Friday, with Syrian government forces seizing its last major city on one side of the border and Iraqi troops taking its last big town on the other. The groupâ€™s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, is believed to be hiding in the desert near the frontier, and regional officials fear it will reconstitute itself as a guerrilla force, capable of waging attacks without territory to defend. Saipovâ€™s sister believes he may have been brainwashed, and she appealed to Trump on Friday to ensure he gets a fair trial. Speaking by phone from the Uzbek capital Tashkent, she told Reuters she hoped Trump would help make sure her brother was given â€œmore timeâ€ and â€œa fair trial.â€ In a separate interview with Radio Free Europe, she said she spoke with her brother the day before the attack and he was in a good mood. â€œIt was a usual, good conversation,â€ she said. Five Argentine tourists, a Belgian woman, a New Yorker and a New Jersey man were killed in Tuesday afternoonâ€™s attack. The attack unfolded just blocks from the site of the World Trade Center, where some 2,600 people were killed when suicide hijackers crashed two jetliners into the Twin Towers 16 years ago.    The Federal Bureau of Investigation has said it has located another Uzbek man, Mukhammadzoir Kadirov, 32, who it said was wanted for questioning as a person of interest in the attack. ",Real
" Ann Coulter Thinks We Need To Get Rid Of The â€˜Utterly Uselessâ€™ CIA (AUDIO) Conservative political analyst (and all around vile human being) Ann Coulter has decided that in the wake of the whole fiasco with Russia interfering in our election, we should just get rid of the Central Intelligence Agency altogether. Poof! Problem solved!During an interview on Sean Hannity s radio show, Coulter was asked about the recent CIA revelations that Russia interfered in our election not just to undermine confidence in U.S. elections, but in an attempt to help Donald Trump win the White House. What do you think of this effort to undermine   first it was the recount, then it was the Russians hacked, even though there s no new evidence at all and the FBI and director of national intelligence disagree. And I know because I ve interviewed a number of these people, electors being harassed to change their votes away from Trump. What do you make of the effort to delegitimize him?  Hannity asked.Coulter s answer was even more jaw-droppingly stupid that what we have come to expect from her.It doesn t make any sense, the FBI disputes it. One of the main proponents of this, of this Russia  I mean, the articles in The New York Times and The Washington Post, they re all anonymous sources from the CIA, an agency we really need to get rid of because it is utterly useless and it eats up a lot of tax money. And this isn t something I m bringing up for the first time now; my loyal readers know I ve been making fun of US intelligence for a good decade now. We have the worst intelligence collecting in the world. Worse than Burkina Faso, it s worse than Walmart s intelligence, because the Democrats decided to destroy the CIA after Watergate.Seriously. This woman thinks that because the CIA called out Russia for their blatant meddling in our election, we should just get rid of the entire agency completely. And, of course, it s all the Democrats  fault. Naturally. The CIA busted Trump s buddy Putin interfering in our presidential election, on Trump s behalf, and this is her response.

The Senate voted 51-48 to debate the legislation about an hour after the House of Representatives approved what is widely expected to become the first overhaul of the U.S. tax code in more than 30 years.

"Attorney General Sessions has lukewarm praise for FBI after Trump attack WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who oversees the Federal Bureau of Investigation, on Friday offered a tepid endorsement of the nationâ€™s leading law enforcement agency, which has been under attack by President Donald Trump and other Republicans. Trump said earlier this month that the FBIâ€™s reputation was in â€œtattersâ€ after news came to light that an FBI agent on a team investigating links between Russia and Trumpâ€™s election campaign had exchanged anti-Trump text messages with an FBI lawyer.     Sessions on Friday defended the bureau, which is part of the Department of Justice that he leads, but it was not an enthusiastic endorsement. â€œI donâ€™t share the view that the FBI is not functioning at a high level all over the country,â€ he told a news conference. Sessionsâ€™ comments came at a time when former FBI director Robert Mueller is leading an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. A sampling of texts between agent Peter Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page was released to Congress and the media earlier this week. The two referred to Trump as an â€œidiot,â€ but also took aim at other politicians, including Democrat Hillary Clinton, who lost to Trump in the 2016 election, and independent Bernie Sanders, who had sought the Democratic nomination for president. Strzok was transferred off Muellerâ€™s team, but the texts provided fresh fodder for some Republicans who have fiercely criticized Mueller in a move that Democrats say is an effort to discredit his Russia investigation. Russia has denied meddling in the 2016 election, and Trump has repeatedly said his campaign did not collude with Russia.         Sessions is the latest senior official to defend the FBI. His comments were much milder than those of FBI Director Christopher Wray and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in recent testimony to Congress. Sessions said Trump does support the FBI and noted that Trump spoke earlier on Friday to a class of domestic and international law enforcement managers graduating from an FBI training program in Quantico, Virginia. However, the audience did not consist of FBI agents, and Trumpâ€™s speech was to local and state police officers. Sessions also ducked a question about whether he will appoint a second special counsel to investigate some of the bias allegations against Muellerâ€™s team, as some Republicans have demanded. ",Real

" Mueller Spokesman Just F-cked Up Donald Trumpâ€™s Christmas Trump supporters and the so-called president s favorite network are lashing out at special counsel Robert Mueller and the FBI. The White House is in panic-mode after Mueller obtained tens of thousands of transition team emails as part of the Russian probe. Ironically, it will quite possibly be emails that brings Trump down.A lawyer for the Trump transition team is claiming that the emails had been illegally turned over by the General Services Administration because the account owners never received notification of the request and he s claiming that they were  privileged communications. In a letter, Trump s attorney requested that Congress  act immediately to protect future presidential transitions from having their private records misappropriated by government agencies, particularly in the context of sensitive investigations intersecting with political motives. Mueller spokesman Peter Carr defended the special counsel s work in a statement issued just past midnight on Sunday, several hours after claims of   unlawful conduct  by Trump s attorney were made, according to Politico. When we have obtained emails in the course of our ongoing criminal investigation, we have secured either the account owner s consent or appropriate criminal process,  he said.The words that pop out in the statement are  criminal investigation,  the  account owner s consent  and  criminal process. While on the campaign trail, Donald Trump asked Russians to hack Hillary Clinton s emails. After the election, Trump s team is claiming that Mueller obtained the transition teams  emails illegally, even though that s not the truth. We see a pattern here.Team Trump thought Mueller was on a fishing expedition. Turns out, he was actually reeling in the fish. The White House was not aware at the time that he had the emails. Mueller got them through GSA so that team Trump could not selectively leave any out if they were requested.Merry Christmas, Mr. Trump.Photo by Ann Heisenfelt/Getty Images.",Fake

No such words were said.The White House released a statement saying the president had been  briefed  on the situation, but it s unclear what his briefing looked like. Trump gets much of his news from Drudge, Breitbart and Fox News.

"Waiting for green cards, Indian visa-holders see hope in Trump review SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - When Gokul Gunasekaran was offered a full scholarship for a graduate program in electrical engineering at Stanford University, he saw it as the chance of a lifetime. He had grown up in Chennai, India, and had a solid job offer with a large oil company after getting his undergraduate degree. He came to America instead, got the Stanford degree and now works as an engineer at a data science startup in Silicon Valley. But for the past five years, he has been waiting for a green card that would give him full legal rights as a permanent resident. In the meantime, he is in a holding pattern on an H1-B visa, which permits him to live and work in the United States but does not allow him easily to switch jobs or start his own company. â€œIt was a no-brainer when I came to this country, but now Iâ€™m kind of regretting taking that scholarship,â€ said Gunasekaran, 29, who is also vice president with a non-profit group called Immigration Voice that represents immigrants waiting for green cards.  Immigration Voice estimates there are some 1.5 million H1-B visa holders in the country waiting for green cards, many of whom are from India and have been waiting for more than a decade. Many of these immigrants welcomed President Donald Trumpâ€™s executive order this week to the federal departments overseeing the program to review it, a move that may lead to H1-B visas being awarded to the highest-paying, highest-skilled jobs rather than through a random lottery. Their hope is that merit-based H1-Bs might then lead to merit-based green cards. â€œI think less random is great,â€ said Guru Hariharan, the CEO and founder of Boomerang Commerce, an e-commerce startup. Hariharan, who was previously an executive at Amazon.com Inc and eBay Inc, spent 10 years waiting for his green card and started his own company as soon as he got it. Green cards can be a path to naturalization and Hariharan expects to become a U.S. citizen soon. H1-B visas are aimed at foreign nationals in occupations that generally require specialized knowledge, such as science, engineering or computer programming. The U.S. government uses a lottery to award 65,000 such visas yearly and randomly distributes another 20,000 to graduate student workers. The H1-B and the green card system are technically separate, but many immigrants from India see them as intimately connected. The number of green cards that can go to people born in each country is capped at a few percent of the total, without regard to how large or small the countryâ€™s population is. There is a big backlog of Indian-born people in the line, given the size of Indiaâ€™s population - 1.3 billion - and the number of its natives in the United States waiting for green cards. That leaves many of those immigrants stuck on H1-B visas while they wait, which they say makes them almost like â€œindentured servants,â€ said Gaurav Mehta, an H1-B holder who works in the financial industry.  Mehta has a U.S.-born son, but he could be forced to take his family back to India at any time if he loses his job and cannot find another quickly. â€œHeâ€™s never been to my country,â€ Mehta said of his son. â€œBut weâ€™ll have no choice if we have to go. Nobody likes to live in constant fear.â€  The H1-B visa is tied to a specific employer, who must apply for the visa and sponsor the employee for a specific job laid out in the visa application. To switch employers, the visa holder must secure their paperwork from their current employer and find another employer willing to take over their visa. Some H1-B holders suspect that employers purposely seek out Indian immigrants because they know they will end up waiting for green cards and will be afraid to leave their employers. But changing the green card system away from country caps to a merit-based system would require an act of Congress. Some  executives also worry that allocating H1-Bs and green cards based on salary - while it would be done to counter the argument that immigrants undercut American workers - would hurt startups that cannot afford high wages. In the meantime, H1-B holders like Nitin Pachisia, founding partner of a venture capital firm called Unshackled Ventures, are taking more practical measures. His firm specializes in taking care of the legal paperwork so that H1-B holders can start their own companies, a process that is possible but tricky. Pachisia is hopeful that changes to the H1-B visa program could revive interest in making the entire system, from H1-B visas to green cards and eventual citizenship, more merit-based and focused on immigrants who are likely to start companies and create jobs. â€œIf the purpose of our high-skilled immigration program is to bring in the most talented people, letâ€™s use that as a lens. From that perspective, itâ€™s a good thing we can focus on the most talented, and Iâ€™d say most entrepreneurial, people,â€ he said.

" Trump Could FLEECE The Secret Service For MILLIONS During His Term There are a ton of potential conflict-of-interest problems cropping up as Trump prepares to take office. One is his use of the Secret Service. He already made nearly $3 million from them during his campaign, and now he potentially stands to make millions more over the next four years, and probably won t hesitate to do so because that s just how greedy he is.Even as far back as 2000, when Trump first started thinking about a run at the White House, he knew he could make money for himself. Back then, he combined paid speeches with his political appearances, making them paid political appearances. He actually admitted that he could be the first person to make money on the side as a presidential candidate.So what s going on now? Basically, the Secret Service has to pay for travel with candidates while they re campaigning. They paid both Trump and Hillary roughly $2.7 million each for travel. However, with Hillary, that money helped with the costs of chartering a plane, so it s not like she actually just raked it in from them.However, since Trump was using his own airline for travel, they simply paid him the money for travel. Yes, the costs associated with using those aircraft were rolled in, but Trump owns the airline. Therefore, the money essentially went into his own pocket.He and Melania will be flying around now on Air Force One and Marine One. What about their kids, though? Trump s adult children are up for unpaid positions in his administration (he can t officially hire family). Also, the Secret Service is supposed to protect immediate family, like children. Sure, they ll sometimes fly on the official presidential aircraft, but other times, they could be flying on Trump s personal aircraft, possibly still with Secret Service protection.And the Secret Service has to pay for that. It ll be the same as the campaign   that money will essentially go into Trump s coffers.No wonder he s willing to take a $1 salary as president. He sounds all wonderfully altruistic that way, but the truth his he has a huge opportunity to make millions anyway. Even the $50,000 expense account is peanuts compared to what he stands to make by fleecing the Secret Service. That makes the gesture as hollow as the CEOs with massive stock options who only take $1 salaries. They still make millions.The blatant hate was obviously not enough, and now we have a man in the White House who will use the government to fatten his personal wallet as much as he can. Who didn t see this coming?Featured by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images",Fake
" â€˜Charlottesville 3.0â€™: Nazis Descend Upon College Town For Another Torch-Lit Rally (TWEETS/IMAGES) We all remember the horrific violence that occurred in Charlottesville, Virginia in August. White supremacists, Ku Klux Klan members, and other assorted white supremacists descended upon the historic college town to do violence, and they succeeded. Their efforts began with a torch lit march the night before, and continued with a rally the next day that quickly turned violent. It eventually ended in a white supremacist driving his car into a crowd of counter-protesters and killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer. Now, it seems that they are at it again.As of this writing, white nationalists are holding another torch lit march in Charlottesville. As despicable as that is, it s true. White supremacist leader Richard Spencer boasted that what he calls  Charlottesville 3.0  was, quote, a  success.

" Trump State Campaign Chair In Hot Water For Trafficking A Kid For Sex (DETAILS) Donald Trump is himself, a pervert. We all knew that. Despite the fact that we have audio proof of this, the  family values  party embraced him with open arms. However, the longer Trump stays in office, the more dirt that comes out about him and those associated with him. Case in point   the Kentucky state chair for Trump s 2016 presidential campaign.Tim Nolan is a member of the Board of Education of Campbell County in California, Kentucky. He is also a former judge, and he happened to run Donald Trump s state campaign there. On Friday, he was led away in handcuffs on a most disturbing charge: that he trafficked a child for sex. The local press, River City News, says that the indictment against Nolan accuses him of making a minor a victim of  commercial sexual activity.  This isn t any old scandal that just got dug up, either   Nolan allegedly was engaging in these activities while he was running Trump s campaign in the state of Kentucky in August of last year. Nolan has also been referred to by local reporters as an  outspoken and controversial  type who is constantly riding for the local Tea Party.In addition to being a child sex trafficker, Nolan is also an avowed racist who was removed from the Kentucky Boxing and Wrestling Commission after a Ku Klux Klan photo appeared on his Facebook page. Of course, since the Trump campaign was just fine with white supremacists, Klansmen and the like, they never bothered to do anything about Nolan s association with their election efforts.Nolan s supposed misdeeds were looked into with great interest by the Campbell County Police, which resulted in this indictment. Another interesting twist is that while the crimes and indictment occurred in Campbell County, the arraignment did not happen there. Why, you might ask? Well, because it would be a conflict of interest to have him appear in a courtroom where his daughter, Taunya Nolan, is a County Court Clerk.These scandals with people surrounding Trump just keep getting sicker and sicker. After all, there was just another Trump state campaign chair, Ralph Shortey of Oklahoma, who was caught in a seedy motel room smoking weed and preparing to have sex with a teenage boy. Now, this.Wonder how many more Trump folks are going to be exposed as sexual predators? Well, considering who their boss is, there s really no telling. All we can do is pop the popcorn and wait.

"Factbox: The future of FBI's Russia probe after Comey firing WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trumpâ€™s dismissal of Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey has raised questions about the future of the agencyâ€™s probe into Russian attempts to sway the 2016 presidential election and possible collusion with Trumpâ€™s campaign. Democrats are worried Comeyâ€™s firing on Tuesday could jeopardize the ongoing FBI probe and have renewed calls for an independent investigation. Some Republicans have said that could undermine concurrent investigations underway in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. Here is what could happen next: * The investigations already underway could continue. Comeyâ€™s firing does not necessarily mean the FBIâ€™s investigation into Moscowâ€™s role in the 2016 election will be disrupted or end, legal experts told Reuters. The career FBI staffers Comey put in charge of the probe will likely continue it, even as the search for a new director begins. The parallel inquiries underway in Senate and House committees could likewise progress. * The Justice Department, other federal agencies or the U.S. Congress could conduct independent investigations. The Justice Department could conduct a criminal investigation. But other federal agencies and departments have the power to conduct fact-finding inquiries, according to University of Southern California law professor Sam Erman. Congress could also create a special commission or appoint a special master separate from the committee probes, Erman said. * The Justice Department could appoint a special counsel. Most Democrats have said they prefer the appointment of a special counsel at the Justice Department to oversee the probe since it is the only agency that can bring a criminal case. A law related to the appointment of a special prosecutor lapsed in the 1990s but department regulations provide that the attorney general can appoint a special counsel from outside the federal government. If the attorney general ignores the recommendations of a special counsel, the rules specify that a report must be sent to Congress, according to Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. The attorney general can hire staff to do the job of a special counsel without triggering department rules. This occurred in 2003 when a special counsel investigated the disclosure of the identity of intelligence officer Valerie Plame. * Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein would likely appoint a special counsel. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has recused himself from involvement in Russia-related probes after misstating his own contacts in 2016 with Russiaâ€™s ambassador in Washington. Rosenstein would likely appoint a special counsel. Some Democrats, however, have already raised questions about Sessionsâ€™ role in advising Rosenstein on Comeyâ€™s firing and called for a nonpolitical appointee at the Justice Department to make the special counsel decision. * The appointment of a special counsel would not end the congressional probes. Senate Republicans, including some from leadership, have said a special counsel should not be appointed because it would imperil ongoing congressional probes but a special counsel would not have the authority to demand Congress halt a probe. Criminal probes can at times complicate congressional matters, particularly with witness testimony. But an investigation undertaken by a special counsel would be no different than the one already underway at the FBI. â€œIt wouldnâ€™t interfere any more or any less if a special counsel were appointed,â€ Levitt said.

" Trump Hints He Will Continue To Be An Absolute Diplomatic Nightmare With China (DETAILS) One of the first things Donald Trump did after winning the presidential election was to completely crush decades of diplomatic policy with China, by accepting a phone call from the president of Taiwan. At first, it seemed that China would let Trump s blunder go and chalk it up to his political inexperience. However, when Trump doubled down on his antics, China decided to fly a bomber into the South China Sea in a show of force against Trump, in order to let him know that the United States had better keep the  One China  policy   or else.After this snafu, Ned Price, speaking for the Obama White House s National Security Council, said: There is no change to our longstanding policy on cross-Strait issues. Our fundamental interest is in peaceful and stable cross-Strait relations. Well, now, it seems that Trump is going in that direction again, and is even entertaining the idea of taking a meeting with the Taiwanese president. When reporters asked him about his plans for diplomatic relations in that direction and whether he d meet the President of Taiwan, Trump said,  we ll see. He insists, however, that the United States will not have a rocky relationship with China under a Trump administration: Hopefully we re going to have great relationships with many countries   and that includes China. Well, I got news for you, Donald Trump. If you keep flirting with recognizing Taiwan, things with China are gonna go south really, really fast. Diplomacy is important, as you will soon learn. Some of these international relationships are tenuous at best, and one wrong move could cause the whole thing to come crashing down like a house of cards built on the softest bed of sand imaginable. Now that you are the president-elect, your words have consequences. Don t go bandying about nuclear weapons and undoing years upon years of diplomatic norms. We ll ALL suffer the consequences if you do.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",Fake
" The Supreme Court Just Put A HUGE Stake Through The Heart Of The First Amendment If you read anything about the Supreme Court today, it was likely that they upheld a good portion of Donald Trump s Muslim ban. If that alone didn t show you that elections matter, a decision that s largely been flying under the radar is at least equally disturbing. In a brutal wound to the First Amendment, the court told states that they have no right to not fund churches, even if separation of church and state is in their constitutions.The case surrounded a playground in Missouri and it all seems like a no-brainer when you look at the surface. Missouri wanted to make playgrounds safer, but their state constitution prohibited state money from making church playgrounds safer. Who could possibly be against making playgrounds safer, right? Unfortunately, it s not that simple. As I mentioned, not giving taxpayer money to churches is part of Missouri s constitution. Thirty-eight states have similar conditions.Chief Justice John Roberts, who wrote the majority opinion, felt that not providing money to churches was discriminatory.Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., writing for the majority, said the United States Constitution forbids some forms of discrimination against religious institutions. Officials in Missouri, he wrote, were not entitled to reject an application from a Lutheran church for a grant to use recycled tires to resurface a playground.Justice Sonia Sotomayor and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented. Sotomayor got to the heart of the issue in her dissenting opinion, which is that it s not just about playgrounds.To hear the Court tell it, this is a simple case about recycling tires to resurface a playground. The stakes are higher. This case is about nothing less than the relation- ship between religious institutions and the civil govern- ment that is, between church and state. The Court today profoundly changes that relationship by holding, for the first time, that the Constitution requires the government to provide public funds directly to a church. Its decision slights both our precedents and our history, and its reasoning weakens this country s longstanding commitment to a separation of church and state beneficial to both.Imagine if instead of playgrounds, this case was about pregnancy and STD prevention among teenagers. Would states be forced to fund church-based abstinence only programs at the same rate as they fund scientifically-based approaches? Are states expected to fund discrimination against LGBTQ people?The fact is that churches pay no taxes, in part because of separation of church and state and in part to leave them alone to do the charity work they do. They are already taxpayer funded, just by the mere fact that they don t pay taxes.Featured image via Eric Thayer/Getty Images",Fake

" BREAKING: Trump Campaign CAUGHT Paying Off Hillary-Hating Sexual Assault Victim (DETAILS) If you wanted to see how low the Trump campaign would go to win, look no further than the stunt they pulled at the second presidential debate. For weeks the Trump campaign had been hinting they would invite Bill Clinton s alleged  victims  to the debates, but they teetered when GOP establishment shut them down.Well, at the second debate, they did just that. They invited four women, including Paula Jones and Juanita Broaddrick, to sit front and center as the two candidates squared off.One victim, however, wasn t a victim of Bill Clinton. She, Kathy Shelton, was the victim of Thomas Alfred Taylor, a rapist Hillary Clinton was assigned to represent in the 1970s.Clinton represented her client, begrudgingly and reluctantly, but had to uphold her oath as an attorney to represent her client to the best of her ability. It worked.Yet Shelton still blames Clinton, accusing her of crossing the ethical boundaries beholden to an attorney (she didn t   or she would have been disbarred). So what did the Trump campaign do? They paid Shelton $2,500 to record an in-depth interview with her regarding her experiences with Hillary.The money was funneled by Roger Stone, the insane and graphically vile Trump ally, through his PAC, Committee to Restore America s Greatness.So now the Trump campaign is buying off Hillary haters and coordinating directly with PACs.According the Associated Press:Stone has arranged to pay other women critical of the Clintons.Earlier this year, Stone sought to raise money to pay off the mortgage of Kathleen Willey, who accused Bill Clinton of making unwanted sexual advances toward her during her time as a volunteer in his White House in the 1990s. Stone claimed in an online video interview that Trump had personally contributed to the fund.Trump s campaign has not endorsed Stone s political action committee, and has sent the group a cease and desist letter. The campaign has denied that Trump gave money to Willey s mortgage fund.Classy, Republicans. Real classy. Buying victims of childhood sex abuse to smear a qualified woman while their own candidate admits, on tape, to sexually assaulting women. Republicans have forfeited the right to call themselves the party of family values and morality.Kathy Shelton is once again being victimized, this time by a national political party who can t win on ideas, so they have to win on disgusting tactics like this.How much lower will they sink?Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images",Fake
"House Republicans reject bids to obtain Trump tax returns WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Republican-controlled congressional panel rejected a bid by Democrats on Tuesday to obtain President Donald Trumpâ€™s tax returns, despite warnings that Trumpâ€™s business holdings could pose conflicts of interest as Congress turns to tax reform. At a sometimes fiery 2-1/2-hour hearing that careened from lawmaker concerns over political corruption and national security to privacy rights and tax accounting, the House Ways and Means Committee voted 24-16 along party lines to oppose a Democratic resolution that sought the release of 10 years of Trumpâ€™s tax returns to the House of Representatives. While the hearing was under way, House Republicans separately turned back a Democratic attempt to force a floor vote on Trumpâ€™s tax returns.   Committee Republicans accused Democrats of using the tax-writing committee for political grandstanding. â€œThis resolution is a procedural tool being utilized â€“Â and I think, abusedÂ â€“ for obvious political purposes,â€ panel Chairman Kevin Brady said. Â   Democrats said they were exercising proper congressional oversight and accused Republicans of protecting Trump. Trump has defied decades of precedent by refusing to release his returns, saying his tax affairs are under federal audit. The Internal Revenue Service says audits pose no obstacle to releasing tax returns. â€œWhat is he hiding?â€ asked Democratic Representative Bill Pascrell, who introduced the measure. â€œIt is our responsibility under the Constitution - very clear, very clear - to provide oversight and root out conflicts of interest.â€  The rejected measure was part of a Democratic campaign in Congress to force Republicans to confront the issue of Trumpâ€™s tax returns in hopes of gradually gaining Republican support for their release.  Some Republicans say Trump should release his tax returns. A Ways and Means Republican joined the list on Tuesday. â€œI wish he would,â€ said Representative Pat Meehan, who otherwise argued against the Democratic resolution. Trumpâ€™s critics say the documents would help determine whether Trumpâ€™s investments and sprawling business empire pose conflicts of interest on policies involving tax, regulation, China, Russia and other issues. â€œThe president now says he wants to lead the effort on tax reform? His tax returns are directly relevant,â€ said Democratic Representative Sander Levin. Republicans said the details Democrats seek could be found in the financial disclosure statement Trump has filed as president.   It was the third time the tax panel rejected an effort to obtain Trumpâ€™s taxes.          ",Real

" Analyst Visits Moscow And Finds Russians Are Laughing At Us As Putin Manipulates â€˜That Foolâ€™ Trump (VIDEO) The whole world is laughing at us after we kinda-sorta elected (since the opinion of the majority of Americans are meaningless under our current electoral system, which was introduced to keep slave owning states happy)   largely thanks to the influence of Russian hackers directed by Putin and the FBI through James Comey   a man to office who is, frankly, an idiot.While Donald Trump denies that Russia had any influence in our election and chooses to instead attack the intelligence agencies that have confirmed not only that, but that Putin personally directed it all, the Russian people are having a field day with the fact that we ve managed to elect someone so stupid that he allows their leader to play him like a fiddle.Asked about Putin s recent letter to Trump (that one that spurred Trump to say he is  so correct ), Russia expert Nina Khrushcheva told MSNBC Saturday that The Donald is playing  right into Putin s hands. I was just in Moscow and the Russians are saying  Look at those fools, look at their democracy.  Absolutely,  she said.  How could America lecture us on any development, institutions, human rights, democracy, rhetoric when they just elected Donald Trump. He s such a fool. He s such a bully. That s what America deserves and we re going to take advantage of it.  And that s how Russians feel about it, and now it s taking shape with letters from Vladimir Putin to Donald Trump with their exchange on potential nuclear armament and whatnot. Asked to weigh in on whether or not Trump would hinder an investigation into his cozy relationship with Putin and his talented team of hackers, intelligence analyst Malcolm Nance explained that he absolutely would interfere with the investigation faster than Putin interfered with our election: I don t think there will be any accountability with the regards of the Russian hacking against the DNC or even violating the entirety of the U.S. electoral process. He has benefited from that. He s going to shut down any investigation if it implicates him or his campaign. However, Nina is righ. We are being played as fools by a spymaster-in-chief, a former KGB officer, Director of Russian Intelligence. He s laughing at us in his letters which stroke Donald Trump.  His excellency!  We haven t had a letter like that in the United States since King George III. As long as Trump is manipulated, Russia and China will take our market share from the international markets out there, and the United States will be relegated to a third class country. Trump taking office is terrifying for a number of reasons   and we re going to have to rely on the Republican Party to stop him.

"U.S. attack on Syrian base killed five, Homs governor says BEIRUT (Reuters) - A U.S. missile strike on an airbase near the Syrian city of Homs on Friday killed five people and wounded seven more, the Homs governor told the Lebanese TV station al-Mayadeen, saying he did not expect the casualty toll to rise by much. Homs Governor Talal Barazi, in separate remarks to Reuters, said the targeted airbase had been providing air support for army operations against Islamic State east of Palmyra, and the attack served the interests of â€œarmed terrorist groupsâ€. â€œI believe - God willing - that the human casualties are not big, but there is material damage. We hope there are not many victims and martyrs,â€ he told Reuters. U.S. President Donald Trump said he ordered missile strikes against an airfield from which a deadly chemical weapons attack was launched this week, declaring he acted in Americaâ€™s â€œnational security interestâ€ against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Barazi told al-Mayadeen there were civilian casualties at a village next to the base, but did not elaborate. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based organization that reports on the war, said four Syrian soldiers were killed, including a senior officer. It was citing its own sources. The Syrian army could not be reached for comment.  Speaking at dawn, Barazi said rescue and fire-fighting operations had been going on for two hours at the base.    He said the attack was a form of â€œsupport for the armed terrorist groups, and it is an attempt to weaken the capabilities of the Syrian Arab Army to combat terrorismâ€. Speaking to Syrian state TV, Barazi said: â€œThe Syrian leadership and Syrian policy will not change. â€œThis targeting was not the first and I donâ€™t believe it will be the last,â€ he added. In separate comments to al-Mayadeen, he said: â€œThe war against terrorism will continue.â€   U.S. officials said dozens of cruise missiles were fired against the base in response to the suspected gas attack in a rebel-held area that Washington has blamed on Assadâ€™s forces. The Syrian government has strongly denied responsibility. The U.S. strikes â€œtargeted military positions in Syria and in Homs specificallyâ€ in order to publicly â€œserve the goals of terrorism in Syria and the goals of Israel in the long runâ€, Barazi added in his interview with state TV.

" WATCH: Anderson Cooper Leaves Trump Supporter DUMBFOUNDED For Hypocrisy On Sexual Assault Trump mouthpiece Jeffrey Lord got his a** handed to him by Anderson Cooper on Wednesday night for once again bringing up Juanita Broaddrick in response to sexual assault allegations against the Republican nominee.During the segment, Cooper and the panel were discussing the women who have come forward to tell their stories about how Donald Trump groped them when Lord interrupted to complain that the women didn t talk about Jaunita Broaddrick and her accusations against Bill Clinton, even though Broaddrick has nothing to do with Trump s own behavior.Lord called the women s accusations into question, but Cooper was quick to drop the hammer on his hypocrisy. Why do you believe Juanita Broaddrick and not these two women,  Cooper asked, leaving a dumbfounded Lord to claim that the media isn t giving Clinton s accusers an  equal forum. But Clinton s accusers have no bearing on this election because Bill Clinton is not running for president, as other panelists reminded Lord. Furthermore, Bill Clinton was never charged with committing any crimes. Juanita Broaddrick filed a sworn affidavit stating that the rape allegations against Clinton are untrue. And these accusations against Clinton are 20 years old and have received a ton of media coverage over the years, especially during Clinton s presidency. The allegations against Trump, meanwhile, are new and haven t received near as much coverage.But Lord whined that the New York Times hasn t interviewed Broaddrick and then brought up a ridiculous anecdotal claim about meeting a couple from Virginia who supposedly think the media the treating Trump unfairly.When it became clear that Lord and Trump s other surrogates were not going to win this fight they resorted to calling Hillary Clinton an  enabler  of Bill Clinton behavior who supposedly bullied the women accusing Bill of sexual misconduct.But the other panelists would have none of it and proceeded to smack them down.Here s the video via YouTube:[ad3media campaign= 1136 ]The accusations against Bill Clinton have nothing to do with this election.

"Trump's call for military buildup hits bump in Congress WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s push for a major military buildup suffered a setback on Thursday when the House of Representatives put plans on hold to fully fund the federal government through next Sept. 30 and instead resorted to temporary measures freezing spending at current levels. With a Dec. 8 deadline rapidly approaching for either extending federal funding in some way or triggering a partial government shutdown, the House next week will advance a temporary patch, according to a senior aide, and try to provide money through Dec. 22. That will give Congress more time to craft a second patch, the aide said, to operate the government through January. While the moves, if successful, would keep the Pentagon running at last yearâ€™s levels, they are far from Republican hopes of handing Trump about $634 billion in fiscal 2018 funding for the militaryâ€™s regular operations, $85 billion above last year. For months, Republican and Democratic leaders in the House and Senate have been working behind the scenes to broker a deal on overall spending levels for the current fiscal year, which already is two months old. Democrats are demanding increases in non-defense spending if military budgets are pumped up as Trump has demanded. It is unclear whether Republicans in Congress and Trump will allow unrelated controversial measures to be attached to either of the temporary spending bills. Democrats, whose votes normally are needed in the Republican-controlled Congress to pass spending bills, have been hoping to use their political leverage to win passage of an immigration measure by attaching it to an end-of-year appropriations bill. That bill would provide legal protections to â€œDreamers,â€ the hundreds of thousands of undocumented people who came to the United States as children and have established roots. House Speaker Paul Ryan, asked about the possibility of attaching the immigration provision to a spending bill, said he wanted to resolve the issue. But he noted that Congress is under a March deadline to pass the Dreamers measure, saying â€œWeâ€™ve got other deadlines in front of that,â€ referring to the spending bills. ",Real
"U.S. mulls request by lawmakers to waive shipping limits on Puerto Rico WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said on Wednesday it is considering a request by members of Congress to waive federal restrictions on shipping to Puerto Rico, but has not received any formal requests from shippers or other branches of the federal government to waive the law. â€œWe are considering the underlying issues and are evaluating whether a waiver should be issued,â€ said a senior Homeland Security official, who spoke to reporters on the grounds of anonymity. The Jones Act requires that all goods shipped between U.S. ports be carried by American owned-and-operated ships. Several U.S. lawmakers, including Representative Nydia Velazquez, on Monday asked DHS to waive the Jones Act restrictions for a year to help relief efforts in Puerto Rico where people are suffering from water and food shortages in the wake of Hurricane Maria. But a request from a member of Congress is not the usual pathway by which the department gets waiver requests, the DHS official said. Puerto Rico has long railed against the Jones Act, saying it raises the cost of imported basic commodities, such as food, clothing and fuel. But the official said that the Defense Department and FEMA have not indicated there is a lack of ships to get food and goods to the island. The official did not deny that the law can add costs to goods delivered to the island, an argument made by longtime opponent of the Jones Act, Republican Senator John McCain. But the DHS official said Jones Act exemptions are based solely on the interest of national defense.  â€œThe real challenges happen to be on the island itself,â€ the official said, adding that there were plenty of U.S.-flagged barges and tugs available.  DHS has the ability to initiate a waiver to the shipping law, but the official said it is constrained by the national defense parameter.  â€œRight now, we do not have the authority to issue a waiver simply to make goods cost less,â€ he said.

"In first visit, Trump urges reform so U.N. can meet full potential UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump criticized the United Nations for bloated bureaucracy and mismanagement on his first visit on Monday to U.N. headquarters, calling for â€œtruly bold reformsâ€ so it could be a greater force for world peace. Ahead of his maiden speech to the annual U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday, Trump hosted a short event to boost support for changes to the United Nations. â€œIn recent years the United Nations has not reached its full potential because of bureaucracy and mismanagement, while the United Nations on a regular budget has increased by 140 percent and its staff has more than doubled since 2000,â€ Trump said. â€œThe United Nations must hold every level of management accountable, protect whistleblowers and focus on results rather than on process,â€ Trump said.  â€œI am confident that if we work together and champion truly bold reforms the United Nations will emerge as a stronger, more effective, more just and greater force for peace and harmony in the world,â€ Trump said in his first remarks at the U.N. in New York since his inauguration as president in January. In a building where long statements are commonplace, Trump spoke for just four minutes.  Some 128 countries were invited to attend Mondayâ€™s reform meeting after signing on to a U.S.-drafted 10-point political declaration backing efforts by U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres â€œto initiate effective, meaningful reform.â€ U.N. Security Council veto powers Russia and China did not sign the declaration.  Businessman Trump, who complained during his 2016 election campaign about the United States paying a disproportionate amount of money to the United Nations, made the point again on Monday. â€œWe must ensure that no one and no member state shoulders a disproportionate share of the burden and thatâ€™s militarily or financially.â€  The United States is the biggest U.N. contributor, providing 22 percent of its $5.4 billion biennial core budget and 28.5 percent of its $7.3 billion peacekeeping budget. The contributions are agreed on by the 193-member General Assembly. Guterres, who also took office in January, told the meeting: â€œTo serve the people we support and the people who support us, we must be nimble and effective, flexible and efficient.â€ He agreed that U.N bureaucracy was a problem that kept him up at night.     â€œOur shared objective is a 21st century U.N. focused more on people and less on process,â€ Guterres said. â€œValue for money while advancing shared values â€“ that is our common goal.â€ Trump also said that all peacekeeping missions should â€œhave clearly defined goals and metrics for evaluating success.â€ The United States is reviewing each of the U.N. peacekeeping missions as annual mandates come up for Security Council renewal in a bid to cut costs. The United States is a veto-wielding council member, along with Britain, France, Russia and China. On Sunday night, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson met with U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi.  When asked if the U.N. refugee agency could perform its current missions if the United States cut its voluntary contributions to the budget, according to a pool report Grandi answered: â€œI would say no.â€ â€œU.S. aid is vital to what we do to support refugees around the world and to find solutions to their situations,â€ Grandi said.

It also left the Medicaid overhaul in the initial bill largely unchanged, which drew opposition from moderate Republicans concerned it would throw many of their most vulnerable residents off their health insurance.

But it wasn t easy, was it, Mr. Ryan?CBS correspondent Nancy Cordes asked Speaker Ryan if he still has  full confidence in Donald Trump.  This is an easy question for the meth-addled morons who still hang on every word spoken by their favorite fascist, but Ryan (like many Republicans who want to be re-elected) seemed to have difficulty with the question. He simply looked down, a  get me the f*ck out of here  expression overtaking his rodent-like face.In recent days, we learned that Donald Trump handed state secrets directly to Russia in the Oval Office, and that James Comey s firing occurred after he refused to pledge his loyalty to Trump and requested additional resources for his investigation into The Donald s collusion with Russia.

"Republican officials from 16 states back Trump in travel ban fight WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican officials from 16 U.S. states led by Texas said on Tuesday they have come to the defense of President Donald Trumpâ€™s ban on travelers from six Muslim-majority nations, telling the Supreme Court the order did not unconstitutionally single out Muslims and was needed to protect national security. The officials filed a legal brief with the Supreme Court as it mulls whether to take up the Trump administrationâ€™s appeal of lower court rulings blocking the travel ban signed by the Republican president on March 6 and let it go into effect. In the statesâ€™ brief, filed on Monday, Texas Solicitor General Scott Keller wrote that the executive order does not mention religion at all and distinguishes people based only on nationality. â€œThe executive order therefore is emphatically not a â€˜Muslim ban,â€™â€ Keller wrote. Keller added that courts should be careful when second-guessing a presidentâ€™s national security determinations, an argument that echoes the administrationâ€™s view that the judiciary should defer to the president on such matters. The brief said the order did not violation the Constitutionâ€™s ban on the government favoring or disfavoring any particular religion or its guarantee of due process. The filing came after the administration asked the high court last Thursday to allow the order to take effect. [nL1N1IZ03Q] Aside from Texas, the officials were Republican state attorneys general from Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Kansas, Louisiana, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee and West Virginia, as well as Mississippiâ€™s Republican governor. Three Republican attorneys general came from states with Democratic governors: Louisiana, Montana and West Virginia. Most of the states had also backed Trump earlier in the litigation. Many Democratic state officials have opposed the ban in lower courts. The high court is due to review legal papers filed by the banâ€™s challengers, backed by the American Civil Liberties Union, before acting. The briefs are due on Monday. A key issue before the justices in whether Trumpâ€™s comments during the 2016 president campaign, including calling for â€œa total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,â€ can be used as evidence that his order was intended to discriminate against Muslims.  The administration filed emergency applications with the justices seeking to block lower court rulings that went against Trumpâ€™s order barring entry for people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days while the U.S. government implements stricter visa screening. Trumpâ€™s order also called for suspending all refugee admissions for 120 days. The move comes after the Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on May 25 upheld a Maryland judgeâ€™s ruling blocking the order. [nL1N1IR1FY]  Potentially making it harder for his lawyers to win at the Supreme Court, Trump again commented on the case on Monday, tweeting complaints that his own administration had issued a â€œwatered down, politically correct versionâ€ of an earlier order he signed on Jan. 27 that also was blocked by courts.

" Hillary Just Responded To Trumpâ€™s Pre-Debate Bullsh*t On Twitter, And Itâ€™s EPIC (TWEET) After the release of the videotape showing Trump not only use derogatory language about women, but also profess to be a sexual predator, we re starting to notice the Trump campaign in a bit of tailspin.Trump s getting so desperate, in fact, that he just dragged out some women who allege they re victims of sexual abuse from Bill Clinton. What people need to remember is that, no matter if any of those allegations are true, Bill is not who is running for president. Trump is acting out of fear because he knows he s about to have his orange ass handed to him.Hillary s Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri released the official statement from the Clinton campaign regarding Trump s desperation:The statement read: We re not surprised to see Donald Trump continue his destructive race to the bottom. Hillary Clinton understands the opportunity in this town hall is to talk to voters on stage and in the audience about the issues that matter to them, and this stunt doesn t change that. If Donald Trump doesn t see that, that s his loss. As always, she s prepared to handle whatever Donald Trump throws her way. However, it was what Clinton tweeted next that shows us exactly why she will be the next President of the United States. Instead of jumping back at all the crazy that is Donald Trump, she instead tweets this:Remember. #Debate pic.twitter.com/rlMbTt5WwY  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 10, 2016Which is exactly what she will do.Donald Trump is currently self-destructing before our very eyes, and he has no idea what to do next.Hillary will stick to the issues and what s best for the nation as Trump takes the low road and tries to mudsling himself into the White House.This election has certainly been an interesting one, and something tells me it s only going to get worse before it gets better, and by  gets better  I mean, when Hillary wins on November 8th.Featured Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",Fake

"Democratic senator lifts hold on Trump antitrust nominee -aide WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has lifted her hold on President Donald Trumpâ€™s pick to run the Justice Departmentâ€™s Antitrust Division, a move that will allow the Senate to vote to confirm Makan Delrahim, a senior Republican aide said on Friday. Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, had met with Delrahim early in September where she pressed him about her concerns about lobbying and political interference in antitrust.  Delrahim, a veteran of the Justice Department and a lobbyist, has been nominated to be assistant attorney general. It was not immediately clear when the vote would go forward. The president took an usually long time nominating Delrahim, finally naming him in late March. The Senate Judiciary Committee approved him in June, and sent his nomination to the full Senate. In the interim, the Justice Department Antitrust Division is being run by Andrew Finch, who will become a deputy to Delrahim once he is in place. Warrenâ€™s office and Delrahim did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the hold being lifted. Senator Orrin Hatch, a member of the Judiciary Committee and a Utah Republican, has worked with Warren and others to address concerns about Delrahimâ€™s nomination, Hatchâ€™s office said in a statement.  Warren had been concerned about Trump attempting to exert political influence on antitrust decisions. As a candidate, Trump had said he would oppose AT&T Incâ€™s proposed $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc, owner of CNN and one of the countryâ€™s largest film and television companies. Delrahim said in his confirmation hearing in May that on his watch, the divisionâ€™s merger reviews would be free from any political influence.",Real
" Voters Prefer Americaâ€™s Most Hated Airline Over Donald Trump The current occupant of the White House has finally accomplished something for his first 100 days in office; he s considered by American voters to be worse than the country s most hated airline. United just can t stay out of the news. In late March, a United Airlines agent at Denver International Airport stopped two teenage girls from boarding a flight because they wore leggings. Earlier this month a passenger was violently dragged from his seat and down the aisle because the flight was overbooked. That man, a doctor, had to go to the hospital after the incident. Also, earlier this month, a man on a United flight back from Mexico was falsely accused of trafficking his white daughter.Trump is even more unfavorable than United Airlines.A whopping 42 percent of those surveyed by Public Policy Polling (PPP) say they prefer United more than Trump. In contrast, 40 percent favor Trump.We re sure the former reality show star won t be touting these numbers on his Twitter timeline:Pollsters found generally negative attitudes toward United, with 47 percent viewing it unfavorably. Twenty-three percent see the airline favorably.PPP discovered Trump fares worse than United, with 52 percent of respondents considering him unfavorably and 43 percent favorably.In the survey, United was ranked as America s worst airline. The aforementioned 69-year-old doctor s attorney said his client suffered a concussion, broken nose and lost two teeth during the incident.Trump s poll numbers are abysmally low, even in other surveys. The most recent one done by Pew Research shows the alleged president still garnering historically low approval numbers for any president during his first 90 days on the job.To put this in perspective, at this same point in Barack Obama s presidency, four times as many Republicans approved of him as Democrats who approve of Trump now.There is a difference between United and Trump. United feigns to be a caring airline in its ads, then drags customers off their flights without consequence. Trump is treating people exactly as he said he would. Nothing he does comes as a surprise to any of us. That is, unless you weren t paying attention during his campaign.Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images",Fake

There was nothing patriotic about that speech. It was a depressing and divisive speech that hurt America s image around the world.It was a pathetic inaugural address delivered in front of an equally pathetic inauguration audience that will go down in history as a horribly pathetic moment, which, hopefully, we can live long enough to put behind us in four years when we have a chance to oust Trump and put someone in office who will fix the disastrous mess he and the Republican Congress will cause.Featured image via Twitter",Fake
"Congress votes to call on Trump to denounce hate groups (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress passed a resolution late on Tuesday calling on President Donald Trump to condemn hate groups after Trump was criticized for his response to the violence at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, a month ago. The U.S. House of Representatives unanimously adopted the resolution, U.S. Representative Gerry Connolly, a Democrat from Virginia, said in a statement. The Senate approved the measure on Monday. â€œTonight, the House of Representatives spoke in one unified voice to unequivocally condemn the shameful and hate-filled acts of violence carried out by the KKK (Ku Klux Klan), white nationalists, white supremacists and neo-Nazis in Charlottesville,â€ Connolly said. The joint resolution, passed with the support of both Republicans and Democrats, will go to Trump for his signature.  Representatives for the White House did not respond immediately to an email seeking comment. The Congressional resolution calls on Trump to condemn hate groups and what it describes as the growing prevalence of extremists who support anti-Semitism, xenophobia and white supremacy. It also urges Attorney General Jeff Sessions to investigate acts of violence and intimidation by white nationalists, neo-Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan and similar groups. Trump alienated fellow Republicans, corporate leaders and U.S. allies and rattled markets last month with comments about the violence in Charlottesville, where white nationalists and neo-Nazis clashed with anti-racism activists on Aug. 12. One woman, Heather Heyer, was killed and several people were wounded when a suspected white nationalist crashed his car into anti-racist demonstrators. The Congressional resolution calls Heyerâ€™s death a â€œdomestic terrorist attack.â€ James Alex Fields, a 20-year-old Ohio man who authorities say drove into Heyer and other protesters, has been charged with second-degree murder and other criminal counts.  On Aug. 12, Trump denounced hatred and violence â€œon many sides,â€ a comment that drew sharp criticism from across the political spectrum for not condemning white nationalists.  White nationalists had gathered in Charlottesville to protest against the planned removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee, who led the pro-slavery Confederacyâ€™s army during the U.S. Civil War. Trump defended Confederate monuments last month. At a rally in Phoenix on Aug. 22, Trump accused television networks of ignoring his calls for unity in the aftermath of the violence in Charlottesville. â€œI didnâ€™t say I love you because youâ€™re black, or I love you because youâ€™re white,â€ Trump said at the rally. â€œI love all the people of our country.â€ The resolution also acknowledged the deaths of two Virginia State Police officers whose helicopter crashed as they patrolled the Charlottesville protest.

"U.S. directly communicating with North Korea, seeks dialogue BEIJING (Reuters) - The United States said on Saturday it was directly communicating with North Korea on its nuclear and missile programs but Pyongyang had shown no interest in dialogue. The disclosure by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson during a trip to China represented the first time he has spoken to such an extent about U.S. outreach to North Korea over its pursuit of a nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile. â€œWe are probing so stay tuned,â€ Tillerson told a group of reporters in Beijing.  â€œWe ask: â€˜Would you like to talk?â€™ We have lines of communications to Pyongyang. Weâ€™re not in a dark situation, a blackout.â€  He said that communication was happening directly and cited two or three U.S. channels open to Pyongyang. â€œWe can talk to them. We do talk to them,â€ he said, without elaborating about which Americans were involved in those contacts or how frequent or substantive they were. The goal of any initial dialogue would be simple: finding out directly from North Korea what it wants to discuss. â€œWe havenâ€™t even gotten that far yet,â€ he said. Trying to tamp down expectations, the State Department said later there were no signs Pyongyang was interested in talks. â€œNorth Korean officials have shown no indication that they are interested in or are ready for talks regarding denuclearization,â€ department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement.  Tillerson previously had offered little detail about U.S. outreach. On Sept. 20, he acknowledged only â€œvery, very limitedâ€ contact with Pyongyangâ€™s U.N. envoy. When asked about Tillersonâ€™s assertion and what communication there might be between Pyongyang and Washington, a spokesman for the North Korean mission to the United Nations said he â€œcanâ€™t go further into detail.â€ Tillersonâ€™s remarks followed a day of meetings in Beijing, which has been alarmed by recent exchanges of war-like threats and personal insults between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump. â€œI think the whole situationâ€™s a bit overheated right now,â€ Tillerson said. â€œI think everyone would like for it to calm down. â€œObviously it would help if North Korea would stop firing off missiles. Thatâ€™d calm things down a lot.â€ South Korean officials have voiced concerns that North Korea could conduct more provocative acts near the anniversary of the founding of its communist party on Oct. 10, or possibly when China holds its Communist Party Congress on Oct. 18. North Korea is fast advancing toward its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland. It conducted its sixth and largest nuclear test on Sept. 3 and has threatened to test a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific.   U.S. officials including Tillerson say Beijing, after long accounting for some 90 percent of North Koreaâ€™s foreign trade, appears increasingly willing to cut ties to its neighborâ€™s economy by adopting U.N. sanctions. Tillerson said Chinaâ€™s more assertive posture was due to its realization that North Koreaâ€™s nuclear and missile capabilities had advanced too far. â€œI think they also have a sense that weâ€™re beginning to run out of time and that we really have to change the dynamic,â€ Tillerson said. The goal of the sanctions would be getting North Koreaâ€™s Kim to view nuclear weapons as a liability, not a strength.  Still, the U.S. intelligence community does not believe Kim is likely to give up his weapons program willingly, regardless of sanctions.  â€œ(Tillersonâ€™s) working against the unified view of our intelligence agencies, which say thereâ€™s no amount of pressure that can be put on them to stop,â€ Senator Bob Corker told a hearing at the chamber on Thursday. Kim sees nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles as â€œhis ticket to survival,â€ Corker said. Tillerson agreed that Kimâ€™s nuclear and missile programs were aimed at ensuring his own security, and renewed assurances that the United States did not seek to topple Kimâ€™s government. â€œLook, our objective is denuclearization (of North Korea),â€ he said. â€œOur objective is not to get rid of you. Our objective is not to collapse your regime.â€ It is unclear how and when any actual negotiations with Pyongyang might be possible.   White House national security adviser H.R. McMaster said on Monday there were no set preconditions for talks. He added, however, that Pyongyangâ€™s capabilities were too far advanced to simply freeze its program in return for concessions. He also dismissed the idea of negotiating with Pyongyang even as it continued to develop its nuclear weapons program. Tillerson in March suggested the United States would only engage North Korea in negotiations once it gave up nuclear weapons.  But he acknowledged on Saturday that denuclearization would be an â€œincremental process.â€ â€œYouâ€™d be foolish to think youâ€™re going to sit down and say: OK, done. Nuclear weapons, gone. This is going to be a process of engagement with North Korea,â€ he said. Trump, who is due to visit China in November, has called for it to do more regarding North Korea and has promised to take steps to rebalance a trade relationship that his administration says puts U.S. businesses at a disadvantage. Chinese President Xi Jinping did not mention North Korea in his opening remarks while meeting Tillerson on Saturday. He instead offered warm words about Trump, saying he expected the U.S. presidentâ€™s visit to be â€œwonderful.â€  â€œThe two of us have also maintained a good working relationship and personal friendship,â€ Xi said in comments in front of reporters.

"Ryan says U.S. tax reform consensus nears, does not mention border tax WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan said on Thursday that tax reform talks are nearing a consensus to lower business taxes by closing loopholes and special interest deductions, the latest sign that the unpopular proposed border tax may not be included. Speaking at a New Balance shoe factory in Massachusetts, Ryan stressed the need to â€œlevel the playing fieldâ€ for U.S. companies and their foreign competitors but failed to mention the border adjustment tax, or BAT, which has been his main policy for creating a more competitive U.S. manufacturing base. Ryanâ€™s remarks, coming about a week ahead of an end-of-July deadline for top White House officials and Republican leaders in Congress to agree on a tax reform framework, could indicate that President Donald Trumpâ€™s promised tax code overhaul is taking on a more orthodox shape after months of closed-door talks. Republicans in the House of Representatives had billed the BAT as a more effective way to pay for tax cuts than closing loopholes, because it would raise more than $1 trillion over a decade by effectively taxing imports while exempting exports from taxation.   â€œWe are going to slash the corporate tax rate to level the playing field and the business tax rate for all businesses,â€ Ryan told his audience. â€œSo what we need to do is, we need to throw out those complicated loopholes, those deductions, those special interest loopholes,â€ he added.   Ryan said cutting the corporate tax rate from a current 35 percent rate to a 20 percent corporate rate is â€œvery realistic.â€ Administration officials have said negotiators realize Trumpâ€™s proposed 15 percent corporate rate is unlikely without expanding the federal deficit.  White House budget director Mick Mulvaney said on Thursday that Republicans should be willing to accept â€œshort-term increases on deficitsâ€ for tax reform to drive economic growth.   Ryan said tax reform would also include accelerating business expensing, double the standard deduction for individuals, and retain popular deductions for charity donations, home mortgages and retirement.  â€œWe have basically found where our consensus lies on these major issues, which we think are sort of the key cornerstones of tax reform,â€ the Wisconsin Republican said. His failure to mention border tax adjustment could fuel speculation that House Republicans are moving away from the idea in discussions among the so-called Big Six principals. The six are Ryan, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, White House adviser Gary Cohn and the Republican chairmen of two tax-writing committees. ",Real
"Exclusive: Trump administration eyes hardening line toward Pakistan WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trumpâ€™s administration is exploring hardening its approach toward Pakistan to crack down on Pakistan-based militants launching attacks in neighboring Afghanistan, two U.S. officials tell Reuters.  Potential Trump administration responses being discussed include expanding U.S. drone strikes, redirecting or withholding some aid to Pakistan and perhaps eventually downgrading Pakistanâ€™s status as a major non-NATO ally, the two officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Other U.S. officials are skeptical of the prospects for success, arguing that years of previous U.S. efforts to curb Pakistanâ€™s support for militant groups have failed, and that already strengthening U.S. ties to India, Pakistanâ€™s arch-enemy, undermine chances of a breakthrough with Islamabad.  U.S. officials say generally they seek greater cooperation with Pakistan, not a rupture in ties, once the administration finishes a regional review, due by mid-July, of the strategy guiding the 16-year-old war in Afghanistan.  The discussions include officials from across the Trump administration, including the White House and the Defense Department, both of which declined comment on the review before its completion. Precise actions have yet to be decided. But Pakistanâ€™s embassy in Washington warned against â€œscapegoatingâ€ Pakistan to explain the stalemate in Afghanistan, pointing instead to Afghanistanâ€™s own troubled internal dynamics. It also noted past Pakistani efforts to battle militants and expressed willingness to work with the United States and Afghanistan on border management. â€œSingling out Pakistan and pinning the entire blame on Pakistan for the situation in Afghanistan is neither fair nor accurate, nor is it borne out by the ground realities,â€ said Abid Saeed, press minister at the embassy. Experts on Americaâ€™s longest war argue that militant safe havens in Pakistan have allowed Taliban-linked insurgents a place to plot deadly strikes in Afghanistan and regroup after ground offensives.  Although long mindful of Pakistan, the Trump administration  in recent weeks has put more emphasis on the relationship with Islamabad in discussions as it hammers out a regional strategy to be presented to Trump, who took office in late January, one official said. â€œWeâ€™ve never really fully articulated what our strategy towards Pakistan is. The strategy will more clearly say what we want from Pakistan specifically,â€ the U.S. official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Other U.S. officials question whether any mix of carrots and sticks can get Islamabad to change its behavior. At the end of the day, Washington needs a partner, even if an imperfect one, in nuclear-armed Pakistan, they say. The United States is again poised to deploy thousands more troops in Afghanistan, an acknowledgment that U.S.-backed forces are not winning and Taliban militants are resurgent. Without more pressure on militants within Pakistan who target Afghanistan, experts say additional U.S. troop deployments will fail to meet their ultimate objective: to pressure the Taliban to eventually negotiate peace. â€œI believe there will be a much harder U.S. line on Pakistan going forward than there has been in the past,â€ Hamdullah Mohib, the Afghan ambassador to the United States, told Reuters, without citing specific measures under review.  Kabul has long been critical of Pakistanâ€™s role in Afghanistan.  Pakistan fiercely denies allowing any militants safe haven on its territory. It bristles at U.S. claims that Pakistanâ€™s spy agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) directorate, has ties to Haqqani network militants blamed for some of the deadliest attacks in Afghanistan. A senior Pakistani government source, speaking on condition of anonymity, doubted the Trump administration would press too hard, saying: â€œThey donâ€™t want to push Pakistan to abandon their war against terrorism.â€ Pakistani officials point towards the toll militancy has taken on the country. Since 2003, almost 22,000 civilians and nearly 7,000 Pakistani security forces have been killed as a result of militancy, according to the South Asia Terrorism Portal, which tracks violence. But the Pentagon, in a report to Congress released on Tuesday, explicitly accused elements of Pakistanâ€™s government of supporting Afghanistan-focused militant groups, including the Taliban and Haqqani Network, who it said retained â€œfreedom of actionâ€ within Pakistan.  It called Pakistan â€œthe most influential external actor affecting Afghan stability.â€ Pakistan won the status as a major non-NATO ally in 2004 from the George Bush administration, in what was at the time seen in part as recognition of its importance in the U.S. battle against al Qaeda and Taliban insurgents. The status is mainly symbolic, allowing limited benefits such as giving Pakistan faster access to surplus U.S. military hardware. Yanking the title would be seen by Pakistan as a major blow. Some U.S. officials and experts on the region scoff at the title. â€œPakistan is not an ally. Itâ€™s not North Korea or Iran. But itâ€™s not an ally,â€ said Bruce Riedel, a Pakistan expert at the Brookings Institution think tank.  Lisa Curtis, prior to becoming senior director for South and Central Asia at the National Security Council, co-authored a report with Husain Haqqani, Pakistanâ€™s former ambassador to Washington, in which they recommended the Trump administration warn Pakistan the status could be revoked in six months.  â€œThinking of Pakistan as an ally will continue to create problems for the next administration as it did for the last one,â€ said the February report, published by the conservative Hudson Institute think tank. It was unclear how seriously the Trump administration was considering the proposal. The growing danger to Afghanistan from suspected Pakistan-based militants was underscored by a devastating May 31 truck bomb that killed more than 80 people and wounded 460 in Kabul.   Afghanistanâ€™s main intelligence agency said the attack - one of the deadliest in memory in the Afghan capital - had been carried out by the Haqqani network with assistance from Pakistan, a charge Islamabad denies. Washington believes the strikes appeared to be the work of the Haqqani network, U.S. officials told Reuters. U.S. frustration over the Haqqaniâ€™s presence in Pakistan has been building for years. The United States designated the Haqqani network as a terrorist organization in 2012. U.S. Navy Admiral Mike Mullen, then the top U.S. military officer, told Congress in 2011 that the Haqqani network was a â€œveritable armâ€ of the ISI. Any U.S. pivot in its approach would be sharply different than the one taken at the start of the Obama administration, when U.S. officials sought to court Pakistani leaders, including Army chief General Ashfaq Kayani. David Sedney, who served as Obamaâ€™s deputy assistant secretary of defense for Afghanistan, Pakistan and Central Asia from 2009 to 2013, said the attempt to turn Islamabad into a strategic partner was a â€œdisaster.â€ â€œIt didnâ€™t affect Pakistanâ€™s behavior one bit. In fact, I would argue it made Pakistanâ€™s behavior worse,â€ Sedney said. MORE DRONES, CASH CUT-OFF Pakistan has received more than $33 billion in U.S. assistance since 2002, including more than $14 billion in so-called Coalition Support Funds (CSF), a U.S. Defense Department program to reimburse allies that have incurred costs in supporting counter-insurgency operations. Last year, the Pentagon decided not to pay Pakistan $300 million in CSF funding after then-U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter declined to sign authorization that Pakistan was taking adequate action against the Haqqani network.  Â Â Â Â U.S. officials said the Trump administration was discussing withholding at least some assistance to Pakistan. Curtisâ€™ report singled out the aid as a target. But U.S. aid cuts could cede even more influence to China, which already has committed nearly $60 billion in investments in Pakistan.  Another option under review is broadening a drone campaign to penetrate deeper into Pakistan to target Haqqani fighters and other militants blamed for attacks in Afghanistan, U.S. officials and a Pakistan expert said. â€œNow the Americans (will be) saying, you arenâ€™t taking out our enemies, so therefore we are taking them out ourselves,â€ said the Pakistan expert, who declined to be identified. Pakistanâ€™s army chief of staff last week criticized â€œunilateral actionsâ€ such as drone strikes as â€œcounterproductive and against (the) spirit of ongoing cooperation and intelligence sharing being diligently undertaken by Pakistan.â€ ",Real
"EU sounds alarm, urges U.S. to coordinate on Russia sanctions BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union sounded an alarm on Saturday about moves in the U.S. Congress to step up U.S. sanctions on Russia, urging Washington to keep coordinating with its G7 partners and warning of unintended consequences.  In a statement by a spokeswoman after Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. Congress reached a deal that could see new legislation pass, the European Commission warned of possibly â€œwide and indiscriminateâ€ â€œunintended consequencesâ€, notably on the EUâ€™s efforts to diversify energy sources away from Russia. Germany has already warned of possible retaliation if the United States moves to sanction German firms involved with building a new Baltic pipeline for Russian gas.  EU diplomats are concerned that a German-U.S. row over the Nord Stream 2 pipeline being built by Russiaâ€™s state-owned Gazprom could complicate efforts in Brussels to forge an EU consensus on negotiating with Russia over the project. â€œWe highly value the unity that is prevailing among international partners in our approach towards Russiaâ€™s action in Ukraine and the subsequent sanctions. This unity is the guarantee of the efficiency and credibility of our measures,â€ the Commission said in its statement. â€œWe understand that the Russia/Iran sanctions bill is driven primarily by domestic considerations,â€ it went on, referring to a bill passed in the U.S. Senate last month and to which lawmakers said on Saturday they had unblocked further obstacles. â€œAs we have said repeatedly, it is important that any possible new measures are coordinated between international partners to maintain unity among partners on the sanctions that has been underpinning the efforts for full implementation of the Minsk Agreements,â€ the Commission said, referring to an accord struck with Moscow to try to end the conflicts in Ukraine. â€œWe are concerned the measures discussed in the U.S. Congress could have unintended consequences, not only when it comes to Transatlantic/G7 unity, but also on EU economic and energy security interests. This impact could be potentially wide and indiscriminate, including when it comes to energy sources diversification efforts. â€œSanctions are at their most effective when they are coordinated. Currently our sanctions regimes are coordinated. As a result their impact on the ground is increased and through coordination we are able to avoid surprises, manage potential impact on our own economic operators and address collectively efforts to circumvent such measures. Unilateral measures would undermine this,â€ the Commission said.  â€œWe therefore call on the U.S. Congress/authorities to engage with the partners, including the EU, to ensure coordination and to avoid any unintended consequences of the measures discussed.â€ ",Real

" BOMBSHELL: Trump Is Being Investigated By SIX Intelligence Agencies For Illegal Cash Payments From Putin You can probably expect Donald Trump to continue his seemingly endless string of tweets about the  fake news  from a baker s dozen intelligence agencies that says that he and his friends may have been involved in some rather unethical actions involving a certain Russian dictator, Trump s campaign staff, and possibly a whole mess of Russian lady pee.McClatchy DC reports that the FBI and five other law enforcement agencies, including the CIA, the National Security Agency, the Justice Department, the Treasury Department s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, and representatives of the Director of National Intelligence, are investigating whether the Kremlin took efforts to secure victory for The Donald. And apparently, Israeli spies were correct when they said that things were a lot worse than some nice escorts  draining the swamp on Trump s bed. McClatchy s report says:Investigators are examining how money may have moved from the Kremlin to covertly help Trump win, the two sources said. One of the allegations involves whether a system for routinely paying thousands of Russian-American pensioners may have been used to pay some email hackers in the United States or to supply money to intermediaries who would then pay the hackers, the two sources said.The informal, inter-agency working group began to explore possible Russian interference last spring, long before the FBI received information from a former British spy hired to develop politically damaging and unverified research about Trump, according to the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the inquiry.Trump, who will be handed the nuclear launch codes and all of our country s secrets on Friday, has spent quite a bit of time praising, quoting, and agreeing with Vladimir Putin while attacking the intelligence agencies who are doing their jobs and attempting to bring a criminal   him   to justice. For his part, Trump has called the allegations against him a  political witch hunt  and a  complete and total fabrication,  and Americans who care about whether he colluded with the Kremlin  stupid people  and  fools. Trump may have screamed that Hillary Clinton should be  locked up,  but it may be that he is the one who will end up behind bars.Featured image by Scott Olson via Getty Images",Fake
" Trump Campaign Manager Busted In Another HUGE Lie, Worked For A Decade To â€˜Benefit Putin Governmentâ€™ (DETAILS) More information about Donald Trump s Russian ties keeps coming out and now another shoe has dropped. According to the Associated Press, Paul Manafort, who served as Trump s campaign manager in 2016, spent about ten years working to  benefit  Vladimir Putin. His job? To make Putin not look like a murderous dictator.The AP reports:Manafort proposed in a confidential strategy plan as early as June 2005 that he would influence politics, business dealings and news coverage inside the United States, Europe and the former Soviet republics to benefit the Putin government, even as U.S.-Russia relations under Republican President George W. Bush grew worse. Manafort pitched the plans to Russian aluminum magnate Oleg Deripaska, a close Putin ally with whom Manafort eventually signed a $10 million annual contract beginning in 2006, according to interviews with several people familiar with payments to Manafort and business records obtained by the AP. Manafort and Deripaska maintained a business relationship until at least 2009, according to one person familiar with the work.Trump, his administration, and Manafort himself have spent months downplaying his involvement with Russia, even after he left the campaign because of his Russian ties. But it turns out that Manafort was apparently far closer to Putin than he ever let on.In a memo to Deripaska in 2005, Manafort wrote that we are now of the belief that this model can greatly benefit the Putin Government if employed at the correct levels with the appropriate commitment to success.  The effort, he explained, will be offering a great service that can re-focus, both internally and externally, the policies of the Putin government. Manafort responded with a statement that said his dealings with Deripaska are being unfairly painted as  inappropriate or nefarious  and insists this is all just part of a massive  smear campaign. I worked with Oleg Deripaska almost a decade ago representing him on business and personal matters in countries where he had investments,  Manafort said.  My work for Mr. Deripaska did not involve representing Russian political interests. This latest disclosure comes after FBI Director James Comey confirmed on Monday that the bureau is investigating not just Russia s interference in the U.S. election, but also the possibility that Trump colluded with them to sway the election.You can watch more on this story here, via MSNBC:Featured image via video screen capture",Fake
" SURPRISE: The People Behind â€˜Fearless Girlâ€™ Statue Were Cynical, Greedy, Anti-Feminist Men There were a lot of arguments online after the  Fearless Girl  statue was erected in front of the Wall Street Bull. Many people thought it was a perfect representation of standing up to the male-dominated culture of the financial industry, while others felt like it was just another commercial effort to cash in on the popularity of public companies suddenly growing a conscience and adopting policies that appease  social justice warriors  (also known as decent human beings).Unfortunately, one of those arguments has been proven right.According to the New York Post, the firm behind the statue that went up ostensibly to  promote gender equality,  State Street Corp, was caught underpaying 300 female employees, along with 15 more who were black.After the company was audited by the Department of Labor s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, they promised they would come up with the money, but in the meantime, it just looks bad. The company settled for $5 million, an astounding amount, considering the relatively small number of affected employees.How far will this faux-minism set women back? None.

" BOMBSHELL: Trump Lied â€“ His â€˜Armadaâ€™ Was NOT Headed Toward North Korea At All Last week, Trump was bellowing up one side and down the other about a possible nuclear test that North Korea was set to conduct over the weekend. He claimed we might launch a pre-emptive strike against them, and that we had two ships in the region already From an NBC News story dated April 13: The intelligence officials told NBC News that the U.S. has positioned two destroyers capable of shooting Tomahawk cruise missiles in the region, one just 300 miles from the North Korean nuclear test site and earlier this week, the Pentagon announced that the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier strike group was being diverted to the area.  [emphasis mine]Turns out, that wasn t true.The  armada  Trump was speaking of was, at the time, headed the opposite way toward Australia, and had not been turned around. It wasn t until the Navy posted a photo of the Carl Vinson and its strike group in the sea between the Indonesian islands of Java and Sumatra that the story came out. The photo was taken on Saturday, Apr. 15, a few days after we heard that the Carl Vinson had been diverted and was heading toward the Sea of Japan.Now it s headed that way and should arrive sometime next week. Two weeks after we told the world it was already heading there.So what happened?The White House says they were going off of what the Defense Department said. The Defense Department said there was a  glitch-ridden sequence of events,  including a premature announcement courtesy of the Pacific Command, and a false explanation from Defense Secretary James Mattis.All of that, they say, contributed to the false narrative that we had an armada speeding towards North Korea in a grandiose show of force.Really? That makes all the sense in the world.Truthfully, officials don t understand why the Defense Department didn t issue a correction on its timeline of events regarding the movements of those ships. With Spicer and others actually answering questions about it, and the extreme tension of the situation, one would think they d be as careful as possible about this.Instead, it sounds like the White House is putting all the blame for this clusterfuck onto the Pentagon, which is par for the course when they re either caught in a lie or something goes massively wrong.Of course, some Trumpkins will believe that Trump was deliberately misleading all of Asia (sending them into a panic), as well as Russia and us, to trick North Korea into trying something or to surprise them later on. No doubt someone will say that s brilliant.And anyone who does say that s brilliant (up to and including Trump himself, which isn t far-fetched at all) has no idea what the consequences of that kind of a bluff could be. Regardless, we caused a panic both here and among our allies that didn t need to happen, and risked a war over something very false.The Trump administration had better get its act together where hostile foreign powers are concerned.Featured image by Ron Sachs   Pool via Getty Images",Fake
" 2nd Major Trump Team Shakeup In A Single Day; Trumpâ€™s Top Lawyer Resigns It s been a rough day in the Donald Trump White House. After a mostly incoherent interview published in the New York Times, and after a revelation that Trump is going around asking if he could pardon his family and even himself, rats have begun abandoning the sinking ship.It started early on Friday morning, when Trump s beleaguered Press Secretary, Sean Spicer, announced his resignation because he objected to his new boss, Anthony Scaramucci. The shakeup had only begun. By the afternoon, Trump s personal lawyer Marc Kasowitz, also resigned after being demoted from heading the Russia defense and after, in the New York Times interview, Trump threatened special counsel Robert Mueller against going after Trump family finances.In an interview with MSNBC, Times reporter Peter Baker said this about Trump s legal team: People around him definitely are. This is, in fact, connected to the other thing you were talking about, the sort of blowup of the legal team. some of the lawyers told him don t go after Robert Mueller. First of all, this guy is a good guy, he is a smart guy, a person of integrity. In fact, some of the lawyers have said to the president, in effect, if you didn t do anything wrong and we think you don t have anything to worry about in terms of the Russia investigation, then you should want Robert Mueller at your special counsel, because if he finds that, if that s his conclusion, it will have credibility on both sides of the aisle, so don t do that. Baker was proven right on Friday when Kasowitz left the team after it was announced that Ty Cobb would be heading the defense.This also points to a change in legal strategy, and that means that Mueller, if not outright fired, will be in the crosshairs. The goal will be to dig up any bit of dirt and any perceived conflict of interest to discredit him. All of that points to just one thing   guilt. If Trump, his family and his associates were innocent, they would, as his legal team said, welcome the investigation and discrediting Mueller would only put a cloud over any sort of exoneration. Now there s no question. We can be sure now that there won t be an exoneration.Featured image via Pool/Getty Images",Fake
"Republican establishment bails on Alabama candidate after sex allegations (Reuters) - The national campaign wing for U.S. Senate Republicans cut fund-raising ties on Friday with Roy Moore, the partyâ€™s nominee for a special Senate race in Alabama, a day after sexual misconduct allegations upended his front-runner bid for the seat. The move was the latest sign the Republican establishment, holding onto a slim 52-48 majority in the Senate, was abandoning an insurgent candidacy heavily promoted by U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s former political strategist, Steve Bannon. Meanwhile, Democrats and progressive groups, emboldened by  Democratic election victories in Virginia and New Jersey on Tuesday, sought to capitalize on the accusations in support of the Democratic nominee, former U.S. Attorney Doug Jones. Moore, a controversial former judge and a staunch Christian conservative, was accused by a woman of initiating a sexual encounter in 1979 when she was 14 years old and he was a 32-year-old prosecutor, the Washington Post reported on Thursday. Three other women said he pursued them when they were between the ages of 16 and 18, though none accused him of sexual contact. The 70-year-old Moore again denied any wrongdoing on Friday during an appearance on conservative commentator Sean Hannityâ€™s national radio show. â€œThese allegations are completely false and misleading,â€ Moore said. The National Republican Senatorial Committee, which helps elect Republicans to the Senate, filed paperwork with federal election officials on Friday severing its fund-raising relationship with Moore for the special election on Dec. 12. Numerous prominent Republicans have either called on Moore to drop out immediately, as Arizona Senator John McCain did on Thursday, or said he should do so if the allegations prove true, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. â€œMoore is unfit for office and should step aside,â€ former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney said Friday on Twitter. Senator Mike Lee of Utah, who initially took the same stance as McConnell, tweeted on Friday that could â€œno longer endorseâ€ Mooreâ€™s candidacy, after reading â€œthe detailed description of the incidents, as well as the response from Judge Moore and his campaign.â€ Senator Steve Daines of Montana likewise said he was pulling his endorsement. But several Alabama Republican officials did not waver in their support of Moore, who scored a decisive primary victory in September over Luther Strange, the incumbent appointed to fill the seat on an interim basis when Jeff Sessions was named U.S. attorney general.  The race had been seen as a long shot for Democrats in Alabama, which has not elected a Democratic senator in a quarter century. Jones was trailing by double digits in some opinion polls. Following publication of the Washington Post story, several Democratic senators, including liberal Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, sent email blasts to donors, soliciting more support for Jonesâ€™ campaign. The Democratic Party has been coordinating with Jones behind the scenes, wary of providing overt support such as television advertising in the deeply Republican state. Progressive groups MoveOn, Democracy for America and Indivisible expect the allegations against Moore to boost their grassroots efforts to engage Democratic voters in Alabama. â€œWe were planning to go bigger already,â€ said Matt Blizek, a mobilization coordinator for MoveOn. â€œWith the news and the fact that this is a close race, thatâ€™s only going to increase.â€ A win for Jones could transform the political picture in Washington, narrowing the Republican majority down to just one vote. Moore has come back from controversy before. He was twice forced out of his position as the stateâ€™s chief justice, once for refusing to remove a Ten Commandments monument from the courthouse and once for defying the U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage. Democrats have highlighted his penchant for incendiary statements about Muslims and homosexuality. Zac McCrary, a veteran Democratic pollster based in Birmingham, Alabama, said he now sees Jones as the favorite. â€œRoy Moore had much less margin for error than a Republican does traditionally in Alabama,â€ McCrary said.  But Jonathan Gray, a Republican consultant in Alabama, said voters were already questioning the veracity of the Washington Post story, given its timing. The only development that could sink Mooreâ€™s candidacy is a write-in campaign from a Republican backed by the party, he said. Absent that, he said, all the analysis in the world will not change a simple fact: â€œRoy Moore wins December 12.â€ ",Real
"House approves new Russia sanctions, defying Trump WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday to slap new sanctions on Russia and force President Donald Trump to obtain lawmakersâ€™ permission before easing any sanctions on Moscow, in a rare rebukeÂ of the Republican president. It was unclear how quickly the bill would make its way to the White House for Trump to sign into law or veto. The bill still must be passed by the Senate, which is mired in debate over efforts to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system as lawmakers try to clear the decks to leave Washington for their summer recess. The sanctions bill comes as lawmakers investigate possible meddling by Russia in the 2016 presidential election and potential collusion by Republican Trumpâ€™s campaign. Moscow has denied it worked to influence the election in Trumpâ€™s favor, and he has denied his campaign colluded. The White House said the president had not yet decided whether he would sign the measure. Rejecting the bill - which would potentially hamper his hopes of pursuing improved relations with Moscow - would carry a risk that his veto could be overridden by lawmakers. â€œWhile the president supports tough sanctions on North Korea, Iran and Russia, the White House is reviewing the House legislation and awaits a final legislative package for the presidentâ€™s desk,â€ said spokeswoman Sarah Sanders. House members backed the bill, which also imposes sanctions on Iran and North Korea, by a near-unanimous margin of 419-3, with strong support from Trumpâ€™s fellow Republicans as well as Democrats, despite objections from Trump, who wanted more control over the ability to impose sanctions. The Republican-controlled Senate passed an earlier version of the bill with near-unanimous support. The House added the North Korea measures after becoming frustrated with the Senateâ€™s failure to advance a bill it passed in May. Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said the three countries â€œare threatening vital U.S. interests and destabilizing their neighbors. It is well past time that we forcefully respond.â€ But the combined bill has run into objections from some senators, who are unhappy that the House added the North Korea sanctions after holding up the measure for more than a month. Senate leaders have not said when they might consider the House bill. Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he was not sure the bill would â€œfly throughâ€ his chamber. â€œThe only language we agreed to was Iran and Russia. So adding North Korea on, I just donâ€™t know how weâ€™re going to deal with it yet,â€ Corker told reporters. â€œThe better route would have been to send over what had been agreed to.â€ The bill had raised concerns in the European Union, where U.S. allies depend on supplies of Russian gas. But House members said the bill was tweaked to try to alleviate the worries of Europeans and the energy sector. The intense focus on Russia, involving several congressional probes and a separate investigation by a Justice Department-appointed special counsel, Robert Mueller, has overshadowed Trumpâ€™s agenda. The scrutiny has angered and frustrated the president, who calls the investigations a politically motivated witch hunt fueled by Democrats who cannot accept his upset win in last Novemberâ€™s election against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, a former U.S. secretary of state. Without offering evidence, Trump lashed out on Twitter on Tuesday about â€œUkrainian efforts to sabotageâ€ his presidential campaign in order to aid Clinton. The Ukrainian embassy in Washington denied the accusations. The Senate Judiciary Committee had been set to compel Trumpâ€™s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, to testify at a hearing on Wednesday, but rescinded the subpoena late on Tuesday as negotiations over his participation continued. Manafort has started turning over documents to the committee and is negotiating a date to be interviewed, the panel said in a statement. The committee is looking at a June 2016 meeting in New York with a Russian lawyer organized by Trumpâ€™s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr. Trump Jr. released emails this month that showed he welcomed the prospect of receiving damaging information at the meeting about Clinton. On Friday, the panel had asked that Manafort and Trump Jr. appear at the Wednesday hearing, but a witness list released on Tuesday evening included neither of their names.  Manafort met with Senate Intelligence Committee staff on Tuesday morning, his spokesman said. On Tuesday, Trumpâ€™s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, spent three hours with the House of Representatives intelligence panel, his second straight day on Capitol Hill answering questions about his contacts with Russians during the campaign. Kushner had a â€œvery productive sessionâ€ with the House Intelligence Committee, Democratic Representative Adam Schiff said after the meeting. Republican Representative Michael Conaway said Kushner was â€œstraightforward and forthcoming. He wanted to answer every question that we had.â€ Kushner, who is now a top aide in Trumpâ€™s White House, told reporters on Monday he had no part in any Kremlin plot.. U.S. House Republicans on Tuesday rejected a legislative effort by Democrats to obtain Treasury Department documents that could show any ties between the finances of Trump, his inner circle and the Russian government.

" Trump Experiments With State-Run TV And Gets Laughed Off The Internet Well, it s happened. In the manner of every other authoritarian douchebag since the invention of mass communications, Donald Trump is now experimenting with state-run television.Now, he is having his daughter-in-law Lara Trump host a  real news  program (as opposed to all the  FAKE NEWS  organizations who insist on telling the truth about him) directly on his Facebook page. Want to know what President Trump did this week?  the post says.  Watch here for REAL news!

"U.S. veterans to Trump: Save bank customers' rights to sue WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The largest U.S. veterans service organization on Thursday urged President Donald Trump to veto recent legislation allowing financial companies to block customers from banding together to sue, saying it would hurt members of the armed forces. The American Legion, which rarely speaks out on bank policy or politics, said in a statement it would â€œnot be silent while banks and payday loan shops rip off servicemembers and veteransâ€. But it will likely have a hard time convincing Trump to veto the resolution to roll back the Obama-era policy.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an independent federal regulator, finalized a rule this summer that barred banks, credit card issuers and other financial companies from requiring customers to agree not to join group lawsuits and only take any potential disputes to closed-door arbitration.  In a vote of 51 to 50, the Senate on Tuesday passed a resolution killing the rule and prohibiting regulators from enacting a similar one in the future. The House of Representatives approved the resolution earlier, and now all that is needed to erase the rule is for Trump to sign it into law. â€œOur membership has stated unequivocally that we are opposed to situations where our military and veteransâ€™ financial protections are chipped away to increase the profits of the big banks,â€ said American Legion National Commander Denise Rohan. â€œRepealing the CFPB arbitration rule takes away consumersâ€™ most effective tool to protect themselves against predatory lenders.â€ Servicemembers can struggle to sue companies individually because they cannot afford legal costs, move frequently for work, or are deployed overseas, the Legion said. In class actions, individuals with the same complaint band together to lower lawsuit costs. Many veteran organizations tried for months to stop the Republican-led Congress from passing the resolution, and other advocacy groups have also pressed for a veto. That is a long-shot. The White House issued a statement shortly after Tuesdayâ€™s vote applauding the resolution, saying the CFPB rule would have given consumers â€œfewer options for quickly and efficiently resolving financial disputesâ€ and opened â€œthe door to frivolous lawsuits by special interest trial lawyers.â€ The ruleâ€™s supporters say arbitration is rigged against consumers because it is secretive, does not set legal precedent,  and is controlled by the companies. They also say the right to sue is enshrined in the U.S. Constitution. ",Real
" Top Conservative Tries To Define â€˜Alt-Rightâ€™ And Gets It INSANELY Wrong One of the problems that Republicans have is what to do about the white nationalists that are taking over the conservative movement, including the KKK and the Neo-Nazis that have come out of the woodwork since Trump began his run for the White House. Some of them are just trying to ignore it, and some are trying to claim that these groups aren t all that bad when you consider that Democrats were once the party of slavery (today s Republicans are those Democrats, actually), so they re the true racists here.And then you have idiots like the executive director of the American Conservative Union, Dan Schneider, who says that the so-called  alt-right  is really the fascist left.Speaking at CPAC, he told an audience full of conservatives: There is a sinister organization that is trying to worm its way into our ranks and we must not be duped. Just a few years ago, this hate-filled left-wing fascist group hijacked the very term  alt-right.  That term has been used for a long time in a very good and normal way. He s right, it s a  sinister organization trying to worm its way into  their ranks. But it s really a fascist left wing movement?Well, let s look at this. The  alt-right  has always been a conservative movement. It was actually conservative opposition to George W. Bush over his foreign policy. These were people who believed that W. was a liberal in conservatives  clothing who had betrayed them with his policies.They originally had some of everything   Reagan Republicans, anti-immigration hawks, libertarians, and even monarchists, and yes, white nationalists. But it wasn t like the left saw an opening, or saw cracks in the movement, and took advantage of them. It was Richard Spencer himself who, during his evolution from a conservative into one of the worst white supremacists we ve got, ultimately hijacked the term and turned it into an anti-Semitic, white nationalist movement.But since this movement now has the door it needs to shove itself into the mainstream via President Asterisk, increasing numbers of Republicans are trying to find ways to distance themselves from that kind of hate. At the same time, some obviously see an opportunity to use it to demonize the left, which riles up a different kind of hate.Schneider also said: They are anti-Semites. They are racist. They are sexist. They hate the Constitution. They hate free markets. They hate pluralism. They hate everything and despite everything we believe in. All of that is true, but they grew out of the conservative right. Not the left, but maybe he s another one of the many ignorant conservatives who believe that today s Democrats are the Democrats who fought for slavery.When you have an entire movement willing to tolerate people like Steve Bannon, Milo Yiannopoulos, Steve Miller and even Trump himself, shucking responsibility for that movement is antithetical to the conservative idea of  personal responsibility.  The GOP needs to look in a mirror if they want to find an answer to the so-called  alt-right. Featured image by Kirk Irwin via Getty Images for SiriusXM",Fake
" Republican Stuns CNN Host, Wants To Starve Americans To Pay For Trumpâ€™s Border Wall (VIDEO) As if the Republican Party couldn t possibly look any worse thanks to Donald Trump s exploding Russia scandal, some of the party s top members are hellbent on destroying conservatives  reputation even further.On Wednesday morning, Rep. Steve King (R-IA) went on CNN to propose a heartless, revolting solution to getting Trump s border wall paid for. King is apparently accepting Mexico s refusal to pay for Trump s moronic border wall (even as Trump still insists that the country will pay) and has come up with another solution   cutting food assistance to low-income Americans! And while he s at it, he d also like to slash Planned Parenthood funding.This disgusting suggestion came up when Alisyn Camerota asked King if he would be  comfortable with providing $1.6 billion of taxpayer money not from Mexico to bill that wall?  This question was prompted by the House Republicans  threat to Democrats on Tuesday, where they suggested a government shutdown if $1.6 billion for the border wall wasn t included in the 2018 budget. King responded: Absolutely yes and more. And I d throw another $5 billion on the pile, and I would find half of a billion of dollars of that right out of Planned Parenthood s budget. And the rest of it could come out of food stamps and the entitlements that are being spread out for people who have not worked in three generations. Camerota, of course, was speechless. She did a double take and asked: You want to take food from people who are on the lowest rung in terms of the nation s safety net and their children, in terms of foot stamps you re happy to take money from them in order to give the $1.6 billion for the border wall? King tried to defend himself, stating that the border wall would create jobs. Then, he jumped to the school lunch program that Michelle Obama had created. He said: I would just say let s limit it to that anybody who wants to have food stamps, it s up to the school lunch program, that s fine. You can watch King turn into an absolute piece of sh*t below:These food stamps   provided by the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)   are responsible for assisting 45 million people. Trump has already proposed that this program be cut 25% over the next 10 years, and King wants to cut it even more to support an ineffective border wall that most Americans strongly oppose. By cutting SNAP and Planned Parenthood funding, King is solidifying himself as a conservative who doesn t care about low-income Americans. He s truly living up to the GOP s reputation.Featured image via Justin Sullivan / Getty Images",Fake
"Chicago projects shrinking budget gaps in 2017 and 2018 CHICAGO (Reuters) - Chicago will continue to shrink its structural budget deficit in 2017 and 2018, but faces new pension funding pressures starting in 2020, according to a financial analysis released by the city on Monday. The nationâ€™s third-largest city projects it will end fiscal 2017 on Dec. 31 with a $137.6 million gap in its $3.73 billion operating budget, down from $232.6 million in fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2018, the deficit is expected to fall by 17 percent to $114.2 million. The cityâ€™s budget gaps have been declining since hitting a high of $654.7 million in fiscal 2011. â€œThis decrease is a direct result of sustainable and balanced revenue growth coupled with lasting savings and reforms made in the past six budgets,â€ the cityâ€™s analysis said. Chicago has taken big steps in recent years to shore up its four employee retirement systems by hiking property taxes for its police and fire fighter funds, levying a new tax on water and sewer usage for its municipal workersâ€™ fund, and increasing a telephone surcharge for its laborersâ€™ fund. The city is gradually increasing contributions to the systems until it meets requirements for actuarially funding public safety worker pensions in 2020 and for the other two systems in 2022. As a result, Chicagoâ€™s pension payments will jump from $1.18 billion in fiscal 2018 to a projected $1.7 billion in fiscal 2020, topping $2 billion in fiscal 2022 when all four systems will be on an actuarially funded path, according to the analysis. At the same time, the city is weaning itself off of one-time revenue fixes, such as so-called scoop and toss restructurings of outstanding bonds to push off debt payments.  Chicagoâ€™s base budget forecast indicates gaps of $212.7  million in fiscal 2019 and $330.3 million in 2020, although the projections do not completely account for escalating pension payments. â€œThe city previously secured ongoing and sustainable funding sources to match these growing contributions, and the funding sources for these increased contributions will be determined through our annual budget process,â€ the analysis said.  The cityâ€™s total unfunded pension liability, which climbed to $35.76 billion in fiscal 2016 from $33.8 billion in fiscal 2015, has been a concern of credit rating agencies that currently rate Chicago at the low investment grade to junk levels.

"U.S. launches opioid fraud and detection unit (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions unveiled on Wednesday a plan to go after doctors and pharmacies suspected of healthcare fraud by over-prescribing and unbridled distribution of addictive pain medications known as opioids. In a speech at a Columbus, Ohio, police academy, Sessions said a new Opioid Fraud and Abuse Detection Unit pilot program would also study death rates of patients with opioid prescriptions. â€œWith these new resources, we will be better positioned to identify, prosecute and convict some of the individuals contributing to these tens of thousands of deaths a year,â€ Sessions said in prepared remarks. He said the new program would pay for 12 assistant U.S. attorneys serving three-year terms to investigate and prosecute fraud in the prescribing of opioids. Deaths from opioids have surged in the United States.  In 2015, prescription painkillers and heroin killed more than 33,000 people, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nearly half of those overdoses involved prescription pain medications. Sessions has made a priority of fighting drug-related crimes since taking over the U.S. Justice Department in February. It shut down AlphaBay, a dark web marketplace accused of facilitating a global trade in drugs as well as firearms and computer hacking tools. ",Real
"Senate advances on healthcare, with dramatic return by McCain WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Republicans narrowly agreed on Tuesday to open debate on a bill to end Obamacare, but the partyâ€™s seven-year effort to roll back Democratic President Barack Obamaâ€™s signature healthcare law still faces significant hurdles. The Senate deadlocked 50-50 on moving forward with the healthcare debate, forcing Vice President Mike Pence to cast the tie-breaking vote. Senator John McCain, who was diagnosed this month with brain cancer and has been recovering from surgery at home in Arizona, made a dramatic return to the U.S. Capitol to cast a crucial vote in favor of proceeding. The outcome was a huge relief for President Donald Trump, who had pushed his fellow Republicans hard in recent days to live up to the partyâ€™s campaign promises to repeal the 2010 Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. Minutes after the vote, Trump called it â€œa big step.â€ But the narrow victory on a simple procedural matter raised questions about whether Republicans can muster the votes necessary to pass any of the various approaches to repeal. Moderates are worried repeal will cost millions of low-income Americans their insurance and conservatives are angry the proposed bills do not go far enough to gut Obamacare, which they consider government overreach. In a first vote of the many likely to come this week, the plan to repeal and replace Obamacare that Senate Republicans have been working on for months failed to get the 60 votes needed for approval on Tuesday night. The vote was 43 in favor and 57 against. Nine Republicans, ranging from moderates such as Susan Collins of Maine to conservatives such as Rand Paul of Kentucky, voted against the bill, which would have made deep cuts to Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor, and reduced Obamacare subsidies to lower-income people to help them defray the cost of health insurance. Earlier McCain, 80, received an ovation from his fellow senators when he entered the chamber to cast a vote to open debate. After that vote, he decried growing partisanship in the Senate and urged members to learn how â€œto trust each other again.â€ Collins and Senator Lisa Murkowski were the only Republicans to oppose the measure to open debate, and with Republicans controlling the Senate by a 52-48 majority, those were the only votes the party leadership could afford to lose. Democrats were united in opposition to the motion to proceed. Republican Senator Ron Johnson, who cast the last and deciding vote to open debate, engaged in a heated discussion with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell before casting his vote and ending the suspense. A loss on the vote to open debate on Tuesday could have been a death blow for Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare and cast doubt on Trumpâ€™s prospects to achieve any of his other top legislative agenda items, including tax reform. â€œWe have a duty to act,â€ McConnell told senators before the vote, reminding Republicans they had promised to repeal Obamacare in four straight elections. â€œWe canâ€™t let this moment slip by.â€ Republicans have found it difficult to fulfill their campaign promises to repeal Obamacare, which enabled 20 million more Americans to get health insurance. Polls show Obamacare is now far more popular than the Republican alternatives. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated the Senateâ€™s replacement bill could lead to as many as 22 million fewer Americans being insured. The health industry has watched the debate nervously, and after the vote some groups urged the Senate to reconsider its approach. Americaâ€™s Essential Hospitals, a group representing safety-net hospitals, said in a statement it strongly opposed all the Republican plans and feared the big cuts in Medicaid in the bills â€œwould jeopardize the health and financial security of millions of working people and families.â€ Shares in health insurer Centene Corp (CNC.N) turned sharply lower after the Senate vote. Earlier on Tuesday, the company had reported a better than expected profit as it benefits from a strong Obamacare business.     As the debate vote opened, more than two dozen protesters in the Senate chamber chanted â€œkill the billâ€ before they were removed. Senators said several approaches have been discussed, including a straight repeal of Obamacare with no replacement plan, or repealing and replacing the law while also overhauling Medicaid. Senate Republicans also could consider a shortened version of repeal, called a â€œskinny repeal,â€ which would end the mandates in Obamacare on individuals and employers to obtain or provide health insurance, and a medical device tax, a Senate aide and a lobbyist said. â€œSome of us want clean repeal, some of us want the Senate leadership bill, theyâ€™re both going to get a vote early on and I think thatâ€™s a fair way to do it,â€ Republican Senator Rand Paul said. â€œIf either one of them fails and another one succeeds, maybe we can find something in between that actually succeeds.â€ Republican Senator Bob Corker said the goal was to gain enough votes to get a bill through the Senate and send it to the House of Representatives, which passed its own bill to replace Obamacare in May, for negotiations. â€œEverybody understands this is just a first step,â€ he said. Several of the Democrats opposing the motion for debate were from conservative states that backed Trump in 2016 and face tough re-election bids next year, including Senators Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Jon Tester of Montana. â€œWe have a good chance to beat this,â€ Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters after the vote. Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, praised Collins and Murkowski for taking a principled stand against the Republican move to open debate. â€œThat wasnâ€™t easy,â€ Durbin said. â€œThat was an act of political courage on their part; Iâ€™m sure they were under tremendous pressure.â€ ",Real
"Former FBI chief's ire over Trump laid bare in testimony WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Throughout the drama of his U.S. Senate testimony on Thursday, James Comey sat ramrod-straight, his mouth set, all business.  It was the posture of a longtime law-enforcement official and former FBI director, someone used to keeping matters close to the vest.  But even the steady, crisp rhythm of his answers could not hide what lay beneath the surface: Comeyâ€™s dismissal by President Donald Trump last month wounded and angered him.  Beyond testifying to conversations he said he had with Trump concerning the federal probe into ties between Trumpâ€™s campaign and Russian officials, Comey time and again told the Senate committee before him and viewers across the country he not only has a harsh opinion of the presidentâ€™s purported conduct, but also of his character.  Just minutes into his testimony, Comey said the president and his aides had chosen to defame him by spreading lies about his job performance, attempting to shred a reputation carefully built during 20 years of government service. â€œThose were lies, plain and simple, and I am so sorry that the FBI workforce had to hear them and that the American people were told them,â€ he said.  Later, Comey testified he began documenting his conversations with the president because of what he called â€œthe nature of the person.â€ â€œI was honestly concerned he might lie about the nature of our meeting,â€ Comey said.  Trump, uncharacteristically, stayed silent during Comeyâ€™s testimony, despite earlier suggestions from White House aides that he might take to Twitter to respond. He never did, ceding the stage, for the moment, to his nemesis.  He left rebuttals to his son, Donald Trump, Jr., who defended Trump on Twitter, and to his outside lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, who denied the president had ever pressured Comey to drop the FBIâ€™s probe into Trumpâ€™s former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. In response to questions from senators, Comey repeatedly cast Trump as a boss or â€œpatronâ€ trying to secure his loyalty, something that Comey said made him â€œuneasy.â€  At one point, Comey was asked why his version of events should be believed over the presidentâ€™s.  â€œIâ€™ve tried to be open, fair, transparent and accurate,â€ he said, encouraging senators to examine the two menâ€™s â€œconsistency track record, demeanor, record over time, that sort of thing.â€ Referring to a Trump comment on social media about the possible existence of tapes that could provide proof of their conversations, Comey said he was so rankled he decided to hand memos of his interactions with the president to a close friend to leak to the media.  â€œIâ€™ve seen the tweet about the tapes,â€ Comey said. â€œLordy, I hope there are tapes.â€  At the White house, in keeping with Trumpâ€™s silence, his aides played down the dayâ€™s events. â€œItâ€™s a regular Thursday at the White House,â€ Sarah Sanders, the deputy press secretary, told reporters,  as televisions in the West Wing blasted Comeyâ€™s testimony.  Trump watched at least part of the hearing with his outside legal team, in a dining room at the White House, but Sanders said she did not know if he had seen much of it. Sanders took umbrage when asked if, as Comey had suggested, the president had lied.  â€œI can definitively say the president is not a liar. I think itâ€™s frankly insulting that question would be asked,â€ she said. After Comeyâ€™s testimony, Trump delivered a brief speech to a friendly audience at a conference of religious leaders in Washington where he did not mention the controversy. Throughout the hotel ballroom where the event was staged, attendees expressed support for the Republican Trump and distaste for Democrats and the news media. â€œI feel heâ€™s doing a wonderful job for our country,â€ said Donna Hubers of Baltimore, who was checking her phone for Comey updates.  There were some lighter, and literary, moments in Comeyâ€™s testimony.  He recalled at one point that he had to give up a dinner date with his wife because Trump asked to meet him at the White House. That was one of the meetings that Trump allegedly used to pressure Comey to drop the investigation into Flynn. â€œIn retrospect, I love spending time with my wife, and I wish I would have been there that night,â€ he said on Thursday, drawing laughs from the senators. Comey also reached into English history to boost his portrayal of Trump. He was asked by Senator Angus King, an independent, whether he took the presidentâ€™s references to the Flynn probe in the Oval Office as a directive to drop the matter.  Comey replied with a quotation attributed to King Henry II of England, who was at odds with Thomas Becket, the archbishop of Canterbury.  â€œYes. It rings in my ear as, well, â€˜Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest?â€™â€ â€œI was just going to quote that,â€ Senator King said. â€œAnd the next day, he (Becket) was killed.â€ ",Real

" GOP Columnist Bill Kristol Has The Goods On How Republicans REALLY Feel About Comeyâ€™s Testimony The entire nation has been glued to the coverage of fired FBI Director James Comey s testimony all day. When it was finally over, pundits continued to pick it apart. Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee claimed victory for Donald Trump in the government s investigation into potential collusion between Team Trump and the Russians. Trump s own lawyer all but called James Comey a liar in a statement whose clear purpose was to discredit the testimony altogether. And perhaps most pathetically of all, House Speaker Paul Ryan tried to excuse Trump s inappropriate  loyalty  requests of Comey as sheer ignorance of how Washington works. All in all, the GOP message is one of  nothing to see here, folks. Despite these bizarre public statements on the part of top Republicans, there is one prominent conservative who is willing to tell the truth about how the GOP is really feeling about the situation regarding Trump and the Russians. In short, they are shitting their pants. Conservative columnist and editor of the Weekly Standard Bill Kristol tweeted: I happen to have seen various GOP Senators this afternoon. Trust me: Basically, they re not just concerned. They re pretty terrified. I happen to have seen various GOP Senators this afternoon. Trust me: Basically, they're not just concerned. They're pretty terrified. https://t.co/WopZ2LiseR  Bill Kristol (@BillKristol) June 8, 2017This tweet comes as a result of an article in Politico that referred to the Republican leadership s interest in what James Comey would be saying on Capitol Hill as a  collective yawn.  Since this wouldn t be the first time the GOP has sold their souls and lied through their teeth to cover for Trump, I am more inclined to believe Bill Kristol. Further, they know they cannot publicly criticize Trump or show any sort of wavering in their confidence in his innocence in this whole Russia mess without having Trump light them up on Twitter and having his fans come for them.So, in other words, this Russia stuff is getting so hot that even Republicans cannot privately deny it any longer. But, they ll never say a word in public against Trump, because they care more about saving their proverbial political asses than they do about this country.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",Fake
"Exclusive: White House doesn't foresee shutdown, Trump wants 20 percent corporate tax WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House is confident it can craft a deal to avoid a government shutdown and foresees a compromise with lawmakers that will include increases in defense and non-defense spending, White House legislative affairs director Marc Short said on Thursday. In an interview with Reuters, Short also said Trump wanted a corporate tax rate of 20 percent in the tax cut package being debated in Congress despite the president saying recently that it could end up higher. Trump held a meeting with Democratic and Republican leaders of Congress on Thursday to work on bridging differences over the U.S. budget and avoid a stop in government services.  â€œWe have been willing to go along with additional spending on the non-defense side,â€ Short said of a potential compromise deal on government spending. â€œIâ€™m hopeful that ... we find a pathway to get a two-year budget cap dealâ€ that enables budget writers to put together a bill for fiscal year 2018 with boundaries for fiscal year 2019 as well, he said. Short said the White House stood firmly behind the goal of a 20-percent corporate tax rate as part of the planned tax overhaul currently in Congress.  Trumpâ€™s recent reference to a possible 22-percent corporate tax rate was only a product of conversations he had had with lawmakers, Short said. â€œI think he was just reflecting what conversations he had heard from them, but that ... wasnâ€™t intended to signal: this is an endorsement of raising the corporate rate,â€ he said. â€œWhen youâ€™re seeing countries like Great Britain go below 20, youâ€™re seeing Ireland at 12 percent, potentially going to single digits, 20 percent is about as high as we feel comfortable going.â€ Short said he expected Congress to approve the Republicansâ€™ tax effort this year, though Trump may not sign it until 2018.  He said the White House supported a deal agreed with Senator Susan Collins that would restore billions of dollars of subsidy payments, called cost-sharing reductions, or CSRs, to health insurers, in exchange for her support for the tax bill.  â€œThe reduction of corporate tax rates, the delivery of tax rates for middle income families, the simplification of the tax code for the price of CSR payments was a transaction we were willing to make with Susan Collins,â€ he said. Short said the president was eager to find a legislative solution for immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally as children and previously received protection under the Deferred Action for Child Arrivals (DACA) program. â€œHe is anxious to solve that problem, but doesnâ€™t feel like the funding of our military and the funding of our government should be held hostage by that,â€ Short said. Democrats have made a solution for DACA a key priority, but House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said on Thursday they would not shut the government over the issue. Short said he was confident that a shutdown would be avoided. â€œNot just markets, but Americans shouldnâ€™t worry about it. Weâ€™re going to make sure that government stays open and funded. Thatâ€™s a priority,â€ he said. Short said the administration planned to outline its priorities for welfare reform next year. That, along with an infrastructure bill, would be top legislative priorities in 2018, though their timing would depend on the congressional calendar, he said. Short also said the White House would support legislation that lays out how to address sexual misconduct by lawmakers. â€œThe White House is supportive, but also I think that we recognize the ability of Congress to self-regulate,â€ he said. Short, who is the top interlocutor between the White House and Congress and has become a frequent guest on television to explain Trumpâ€™s policies, suggested he was staying put despite a recent report saying he could leave the administration. â€œI have no plans to go anywhere,â€ he said.

"Trump criticized in Britain and U.S. for sharing anti-Muslim videos WASHINGTON/LONDON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Wednesday shared anti-Muslim videos posted on Twitter by a far-right British party leader, drawing condemnation from Britain, U.S. Muslim groups and some members of Congress. The White House defended the retweets by the Republican president, who during the 2016 U.S. election campaign called for â€œa total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,â€ saying that he was raising security issues. As president, Trump has issued executive orders banning entry to some citizens of several Muslim-majority countries, although courts have partially blocked the measures from taking effect. â€œLook, Iâ€™m not talking about the nature of the video,â€ White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters. â€œThe threat is real and thatâ€™s what the president is talking about is the need for national security, the need for military spending, and those are very real things. Thereâ€™s nothing fake about that.â€ Jayda Fransen, deputy leader of anti-immigration Britain First, posted the videos which she said showed a group of people who were Muslims beating a teenage boy to death, battering a boy on crutches and destroying a Christian statue. Fransen was convicted earlier this month of abusing a Muslim woman and was ordered to pay a fine and legal costs. Some British lawmakers demanded an apology from Trump for sharing the videos with his nearly 44 million Twitter followers and U.S. Muslim groups said he had been incendiary and reckless. â€œIt is wrong for the president to have done this,â€ the spokesman for British Prime Minister Theresa May said. â€œBritain First seeks to divide communities through their use of hateful narratives which peddle lies and stoke tensions. They cause anxiety to law-abiding people,â€ the spokesman said. Trump fired back at May over her criticism. â€œTheresa @theresamay, donâ€™t focus on me, focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom. We are doing just fine,â€ Trump tweeted, using an incorrect Twitter handle for May. He later issued a tweet with her correct handle, â€œ@Theresa_Mayâ€.     Reuters was unable to immediately verify the videos and Fransen herself said they had come from various online sources which had been posted on her social media pages. â€œIâ€™m delighted,â€ Fransen, who has 53,000 Twitter followers, told Reuters. She said Trumpâ€™s retweets showed the president shared her aim of raising awareness of â€œissues such as Islamâ€. The White House repeatedly refused to be drawn into the content of the videos or whether Trump was aware of the source of the tweets. â€œItâ€™s about ensuring that individuals who come into the United States donâ€™t pose a public safety or terrorism threat,â€ White House spokesman Raj Shah told reporters aboard Air Force One. Fransen thanked Trump and said, â€œThe important message here is Donald Trump has been made aware of the persecution and prosecution of a political leader in Britain for giving what has been said by police to be an anti-Islamic speech.â€ ANTI-IMMIGRATION One of the videos that Trump retweeted first circulated on social and Egyptian state media in 2013, showing what appeared to be supporters of now-ousted Islamist President Mohammed Mursi throwing two youths from a concrete tower onto a roof. In reference to another video that was titled â€œMuslim migrant beats up Dutch boy on crutches!â€, the Netherlands embassy in the United States tweeted back at Trump saying: â€œ@realDonaldTrump Facts do matter. The perpetrator of the violent act in this video was born and raised in the Netherlands. He received and completed his sentence under Dutch law.â€ Trumpâ€™s promotion of the videos contrasts with the way he often criticizes mainstream U.S. media, lambasting some outlets for â€œfake newsâ€ when they air segments he regards as being against him. â€œWhat we saw today is one of many videos that is circulating on anti-Muslim hate websites,â€ said Ilhan Cagri with the U.S.-based Muslim Public Affairs Council. â€œIt is years-old and simply aims to breed fear for Muslims and Islam and breed violence. It  has nothing to do with the practice of Islam itself,â€ Cagri said. The Anti-Defamation League said the retweets would only encourage â€œextremists and anti-Muslim bigots in the United States and abroad who exploit the propaganda value.â€ â€œSuch content is the engine that fuels extremist movements and will embolden bigots in the U.S. who already believe the president is a fellow traveler,â€ the ADL said in a statement. Democrats in Congress and at least one Republican lawmaker were also critical of Trump.  â€œThe violence depicted in these videos is horrific, but it is abhorrent that President Trump would choose to deliberately fan the flames of hatred and religious bigotry,â€ Democratic U.S. Senator Jack Reed said in a statement. Republican Senator John McCain, a frequent critic of Trump, said he was â€œsurprisedâ€ that Trump had chosen to retweet those videos. â€œWhat do I think about it? Obviously, surprised. Surprised,â€ he told Reuters as he left a meeting with Jordanian King Abdullah at the U.S. Senate. Britain First is a peripheral political party which wants to end all immigration and bring in a comprehensive ban on Islam, with anyone found to be promoting the religionâ€™s ideology to be deported or imprisoned. The group, which rarely garners any media attention but attracts a few hundred protesters to its regular street demonstrations, states on its website it is a â€œloyalist movement.â€ Critics say it is simply racist. Last week, Fransen was charged by the police in Northern Ireland with using threatening, abusive or insulting words in a speech at a rally in Belfast in August. Along with the groupâ€™s leader, she was also charged in September with causing religiously aggravated harassment over the distribution of leaflets and posting online videos during a court trial involving a number of Muslim men accused and later convicted of rape. Politicians in Britain condemned Trump, with Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party, describing his tweets as â€œabhorrent, dangerous and a threat to our society.â€ In contrast, David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan leader who has run for political office in Louisiana, praised Trump. â€œHeâ€™s condemned for showing us what the fake news media wonâ€™t,â€ Duke wrote on Twitter. â€œThank God for Trump! Thatâ€™s why we love him!â€ ",Real
" Republicans BETRAY Trump In Stunning Immigration Twist Immigration was one of the biggest, most divisive issues during President-elect Donald Trump s presidential campaign. Not only did he help spark more racism by calling Mexican immigrants  drug dealers  and  rapists,  but his constant promise to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and deport undocumented immigrants was a threat that many of his supporters clung to.Now that Trump has won the election, he will actually have to try and deliver that ridiculous promise. Already, it looks like he will not only have to contend with resistance from the Democrats   he ll have to fight with the Republican Party as well! Politico reports that GOP Sens. Lindsey Graham and Jeff Flake are teaming up with Democrats to create legislation that would protect approximately 800,000 young undocumented immigrants from one of Trump s deportation schemes. In reference to Trump s threat to deport undocumented immigrants that were given protection and work permits under a 2012 executive order issued by President Barack Obama, Politico reported: But should Trump follow through on that promise, some key lawmakers on Capitol Hill want to make sure those protections stay in place for the immigrants who willingly gave personal information to the federal government and went through background checks. One big fear among advocates is that the Trump administration could use that personal information to track down the immigrants to deport them. Graham, who has been a massive critic of Trump since day one, commented on the legislation and said: The worst outcome is to repeal the legal status that these kids have. Whether you agree with them having it or not, they ve come out of the shadows. [The legislation is] going to be basically, if you have legal status, you ll continue legal status. I think it would pass overwhelmingly. Of course, we can t be sure that Trump will actually sign this into law when he s President, as this legislation likely won t be up for discussion until next year. Althought it goes against everything he s been saying in his campaign, Trump is notorious for his random flip-flopping. Maybe with enough pressure, he will abandon his promises (again).Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",Fake
" Fox News Asks This Man For Pictures Of New York Solidarity March â€“ His Response Is PRICELESS Today, there were hundreds of marches showing solidarity with Charlottesville, Virginia, where anti-racist protesters were mowed down by a white nationalist. As is usual for these marches, people take pictures and post them to social media, and some inevitably find themselves being asked for permission to use the photos in news stories. One man, Keegan Stephan, tweeted a series of great pictures from New York City, and Fox News promptly contacted him for permission to use them across all their networks.This initially happened via direct message, but Stephan was kind enough to post the brief exchange to Twitter. Stephan is an organizer and a student representative for the American Bar Association s civil rights division, and his reply to Fox News  request is simply perfect:For the record. pic.twitter.com/yJ5e5Zmefa  Keegan Stephan (@KeeganNYC) August 13, 2017There are no other words for that than  perfect.  This is someone who truly knows what he stands for, and will not be complicit in the part Fox plays in emboldening these hate groups. Fox News gives air time to people like Judge Jeanine Pirro, Sean Hannity, and Tucker Carlson, who all push Trump s racist and nationalist ideals and who seem to think that conservative whites just have it so hard here now. To allow them to use photos you took while marching against all of these things makes you complicit.It s worse when you consider the fact that Fox News supports a man who fancies himself the greatest person ever to live, but who can t say the word  terrorism  if the terrorists are white.

The White House Office of Management and Budget plans to release a fuller update about its de-regulation plans on Thursday.

" Trump Gives PATHETIC Reason For Why He Sucked At Debate (TWEET) If you tuned into the first presidential debate last night, you already know that Hillary Clinton pretty much wiped the floor with Donald Trump. Trump was so nervous and unprepared that he was reduced to constant sniffling, excessive thirstiness and his usual outlandish rants and interruptions. Let s just say that everyone noticed.Trump couldn t take the heat, and he definitely cannot handle the humiliation that is following the debate. While several major media outlets are calling the debate a clear win for Clinton, Trump is trying to come up with reasons why he bombed so horribly (even though it was perfectly obvious that he would).The best excuse Trump has been able to come up with is beyond pathetic and nothing but a move of desperation. The Associated Press has reported that after the debate, the GOP nominee immediately told reporters that he was unable to perform to the best of his ability because there was something wrong with his microphone. And yet despite something being  wrong with it,  that mic seemed to work fine as he shouted over Hillary every few seconds. AP reported: Trump visited the media spin room after the Monday night debate and said,  They gave me a defective mic! He said he  wonder(s), was that on purpose? CBS s Sopan Deb also happened to be there and gave a little more detail into Trump s microphone conspiracy theory:TwitterTrump is seriously trying to claim that someone tried to sabotage the debate on purpose! What a moron. The truth is that Trump didn t prepare for the debate like Clinton did   and even if he had spent a little more time preparing than tweeting, it wouldn t have mattered much   he s completely unqualified for the White House. Last night, Hillary showed America that these two shouldn t even be up against each other. There is no comparison. Hillary looked like our next President, and Trump looked like a fraud and an imposter who should have never made it up on that stage.I wouldn t be surprised if Trump comes up with more lame stories about why his performance was compromised last night.Featured image via Win McNamee / Getty Images",Fake
" BREAKING: Benghazi Committee Shuts Down After Trump Win, Proving It Was Just A Clinton Witch Hunt It s finally over. Now that Donald Trump has been kinda-sorta elected president by a historic minority of voters and a system put in place thanks to lobbying by slave owners, Republicans have decided that a headline-grabbing fake investigation into Hillary Clinton just isn t necessary anymore.In multiple desperate attempts to blame the tragic Benghazi terrorist attacks on Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, Republicans spent years betraying taxpayers by knowingly wasting millions of their dollars doing their best not to uncover the truth, but to turn public perception against the president and the former secretary of state. Principled  conservatives and other stupid people rallied around the cause as Trump and Stein supporters, unable to tell fact from fiction, used Benghazi and any other fake scandal they heard about on Infowars to demand that Clinton be jailed or even executed for imagined crimes.Yes, it was propaganda   it was effective taxpayer-funded propaganda. But it s over now. Trump will be our next president, the committee has lost interest, and (most importantly),  the truth of the millions-of-dollars-worth of investigations is laid bare: it was all an effort to hoodwink voters. Every. Single. Bit. Of. It.While the panel s chairman, Trey Gowdy, loudly trumpeted every facet of this witch hunt at every step of the way, the final report was added to the official house record without so much as a peep from him. The reason? He d accomplished his purpose. There s no longer any need for him to abuse his position to play politics now that the game he was playing is over. USA Today has a nice rundown of the damage that was done:The special committee was created in May 2014 to investigate the terrorist attacks at the U.S. compound in eastern Libya where four Americans died, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens.In June, the Benghazi Committee report was endorsed by the Republican committee members but not the Democrats. It severely criticized military, CIA and Obama administration officials for their response as the attacks unfolded and their subsequent explanations to the American people. It accused the government of incompetence at various levels, including a failure to deploy needed military assets, CIA intelligence reports that were  rife with errors,  and misguided planning even in the midst of the violence. The report did not single out wrongdoing by then-secretary of State Hillary Clinton, although some Republicans on the panel alleged that overall concern for her political future influenced and hampered some of the decision-making surrounding policy in Libya.Clinton s use of a private email server while she was secretary of State was revealed as part of the Benghazi investigation, but the committee did not investigate whether the setup led to improper handling of classified information. The FBI declined to pursue criminal charges regarding the email system, but it was a major issue in the 2016 presidential election.Gowdy on Monday called the report the  final, definitive accounting  of the Benghazi attacks. The committee is proud to have been able to tell the story of the ingenuity and bravery displayed by our nation s heroes in Benghazi, who banded together to save one another when no other help was ever on the way,  Gowdy said when asked about the report. But Rep. Elijah Cummings, the panel s Batman to Gowdy s Aryan Joker, was quick to call it what it was. Republicans voted on this partisan report five months ago, but delayed filing it and completing the committee until after the election,  Cummings says.  Republicans promised a process that was fair and bipartisan, but the American people got exactly the opposite. If any Republican mentions any aspect of the Benghazi investigation to you ever again, be sure to point out that conservative  principles  only exist long enough for them to work to someone s political benefit. Then they just disappear like this investigation did after Trump  won  and Ebola after the midterms.Featured image via Getty Images/Mark Wilson",Fake

" BREAKING: Mike Pence SHUTS DOWN Crazy Trump Supporter For Threatening Hillary (VIDEO) Throughout the course of Donald Trump s campaign for the presidency, he s been stoking fears around the nation. His goal seems to be to lead through fear and if he can get enough people to believe the lies that he tells, they ll fall in line behind him to be their leader and protector.All of that is absolute poppycock because Trump wouldn t know how to protect you from a falling feather, let alone understand what it takes to be leader of the free world.Now, appearing at Trump s running-mate Mike Pence s campaign event on Tuesday, a Trump supporter brought up Trump s myth of  voter fraud.  Which is that if he loses, it s because Hillary cheated, not at all because he s a horrible human being.Ironically, the only voter fraud currently being perpetrated is by Republicans trying to suppress the vote.However, this woman in the audience, with fear and horror in her voice, brought up the  voter fraud  Trump often talks about. The woman said she s  ready for a revolution because we can t have [Hillary] in. When Pence heard that he stopped the woman in her tracks and said,  don t say that.  And good on him for doing so. Pence then reiterated that the revolution needs to happen is at the voting booth on November 8th. Which, in all honesty, is an incredibly accurate and thoughtful response.Pence seems to understand that democracy isn t claiming the other side won because they cheated, but rather getting out the vote so that your side wins.That being said, Hillary Clinton is about to kick Trump s ass this November and it s because more people will want her over a racist a**hole who admits to sexual assault.Watch the video here: Woman:  If Hillary Clinton gets in I m ready for a revolution, b/c we can t have her in Pence:  Don t say that  https://t.co/P5OrJBGW55  Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) October 11, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",Fake

"Congressman will not seek relection amid misconduct probe WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Representative Ruben Kihuen announced on Saturday that he will not seek re-election, becoming the latest member of Congress to end his legislative career in the face of sexual harassment allegations.   The first-term Nevada Democrat, who is the subject of an ethics investigation in the House of Representatives, denied the allegations against him but concluded that the charges would distract from â€œa fair and thorough discussion of the issuesâ€ on the campaign trail. â€œIt is in the best interests of my family and my constituents to complete my term in Congress and not seek reelection,â€ Kihuen, 37, said in a statement issued by his campaign committee.

"Paul Manafort, Special Counsel Mueller tussle over Ukrainian op-ed (Reuters) - President Donald Trumpâ€™s former campaign manager Paul Manafort did not violate a court gag order when he helped edit an opinion piece about his political work in Ukraine, his defense lawyer Kevin Downing argued in a court filing on Thursday. A federal grand jury indicted Manafort and his business associate Rick Gates in October as part of Special Counsel Robert Muellerâ€™s investigation into accusations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The charges against Manafort include conspiracy to launder money and failing to register as a foreign agent working on behalf of former pro-Russian Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovychâ€™s government, who was ousted in 2014.     Thursdayâ€™s filing came after prosecutors working for Mueller said earlier this week that they no longer could agree to more lenient bail terms for Manafort after discovering that he was working with a colleague tied to Russian intelligence agencies on an opinion piece that cast his work in a favorable light.     Muellerâ€™s office argued that his efforts to work behind the scenes on the piece as recently as November 30 ran afoul of the judgeâ€™s November 8 order instructing all parties to refrain from making statements to the media or in public settings that could prejudice the case. Jason Maloni, a spokesman for Manafort, declined to comment.  Joshua Stueve, a spokesman for Mueller, also declined to comment. Downing said in Thursdayâ€™s filing that his client was involved only in editing the piece to ensure accuracy, and that it would not prejudice the case because it was ultimately published in a Ukrainian newspaper, not an American one. â€œThe defense did not, and does not, understand that the	 court meant to impose a gag order	 precluding Mr. Manafort from addressing matters, which do not â€˜pose a substantial	 likelihood of	 material prejudice to this case,â€™â€ Downing wrote. Earlier in the week, prosecutors said in a filing that they had reached out to Manafortâ€™s lawyers when they discovered the draft and had been assured that it would not be published. The piece appeared online in the English-language Kyiv Post on Thursday. The article, which was authored by Oleg Voloshyn, a former spokesman for Ukraineâ€™s foreign affairs ministry, praised   Manafortâ€™s political work in helping Ukraine secure better relations with the European Union. â€œI can only wonder why some American media dare falsely claim that Paul Manafort lobbied Russian interests in Ukraine,â€ the piece said. â€œWithout his input Ukraine would not have had the command focus on reforms that were required to be a nation candidate to the EU.â€   Brian Bonner, the chief editor at the Kyiv Post, told Reuters that the article was submitted on Monday. Bonner said Voloshyn claimed to have written the article and then sent it to Manafort and the Americanâ€™s longtime Russian colleague, Konstantin Kilimnik, for fact-checking before submission.  Bonner said he did not immediately publish the article because he was suspicious of the contents and wanted to confirm that Voloshyn had written it.   â€œIt was blatantly pro-Manafort with an opinion about his activities that most people donâ€™t share and that his record in Ukraine doesnâ€™t support,â€ Bonner wrote in an email.  Voloshyn told Reuters he was not immediately in a position to comment. It was not clear when U.S. District judge Amy Berman Jackson would decide the issue, but Manafort and Gates are due to appear before her on Monday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia for a status hearing.

" WATCH: Kamala Harris Takes Trump To The Black Church In SCATHING Takedown Of His Attacks On Black Athletes Everyone is fed up with Donald Trump s blatant racism with his disgusting attacks on black athletes who are using their platform to shine a light on the deadly racist policing problem in America. Case in point   Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA). Senator Harris is one of the few women of color in the United States Senate, so this definitely hits close to home for her. On Sunday morning, while speaking at an Atlanta Church, Senator Harris ripped Trump for his attacks, all the while eloquently and passionately going to bat for the players who are exercising their First Amendment rights. She told the congregation at the First Congregational Church: Let s speak the truth that when Americans demand recognition that their lives matter, or kneel to call attention to injustice, that that is an expression of free speech, protected by our Constitution, and they should not be threatened or bullied. When we sing  The Star-Spangled Banner,  we rightly think about the brave men and women from all backgrounds who proudly defend the freedom of those they may never meet and people who will never know their names. When we sing  The Star-Spangled Banner,  we also think about those marching in the streets who demand that the ideals of that flag represent them too. That s exactly right. America is a wonderful ideal, but it isn t applied to everyone equally. That often has deadly consequences, and we see this racist pattern over and over again. That flag belongs to all of us, and until things are truly equal, it is not just a right to protest this injustice. It is a responsibility. Sure, the racists of America would have us believe that the flag and the nation belong to them. They want people to remain second-class citizens. Of course, they will never say it. Instead, they want to pretend that the last 52 years erased the attitudes that contributed to the white supremacy upon which this nation was founded.We all know that it isn t true, though. Good on Kamala Harris for speaking truth to power. She will surely be attacked by Trump, but this strong woman of color will not be intimidated by that orange fool.Watch her epic speech below:Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",Fake

"Commerce Secretary says Trump-Xi talks will address trade imbalances BEIJING (Reuters) - Meetings between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing this week will focus on addressing trade imbalances between the two countries, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Wednesday.  Ross was speaking at a signing ceremony in the Chinese capital for commercial deals worth about $9 billion on Trumpâ€™s visit. Trump has ratcheted up his criticism of Chinaâ€™s massive trade surplus with the U.S. - calling it â€œembarrassingâ€ and â€œhorribleâ€ last week - and has accused Beijing of unfair trade practices, fuelling worries of increased tension between the worldâ€™s two largest trading countries. â€œAddressing the imbalance in China trade has been the central focus of collaborative discussions between President Trump and President Xi and achieving fair and reciprocal treatment for the companies is a shared objective,â€ Ross said. Data on Wednesday showed Chinaâ€™s exports to the U.S. rose 8.3 percent in October on the year, while imports grew 4.3 percent. That led to a trade surplus of $26.62 billion with the U.S. last month, down from Septemberâ€™s record $28.08 billion, but higher than recent trends. Deals signed on Wednesday included a pledge by Chinese ecommerce company JD.com  to buy more than $2 billion of food products from the U.S. over three years and a pact for Reignwood International to buy additional helicopters from U.S. firm Bell Helicopter.  While 19 deals were signed on Wednesday, some in the U.S. business community have expressed worry that contract wins could come at the expense of resolving long-standing complaints over market access restrictions in China. At the ceremony, Chinaâ€™s vice premier Wang Yang said deals signed between China and U.S. firms would â€œcontribute to the stabilization of the general and overall economic relations between the two countriesâ€. The ceremony was a prelude to a â€œmore importantâ€ signing ceremony set for Thursday, he added. Among the companies expected to sign deals on Thursday are Qualcomm, Boeing and Goldman Sachs.

He thought he had gotten through and not been noticed or singled out and that he was going to get away without an individual interaction,  Wittes told the Times.But no such luck. Trump spotted Comey and made a big production out of it. He called Comey out of the curtains, noting that he had become  more famous  that himself and then proceeded to hug Comey   against his will.Comey said that as he was walking across the room he was determined that there wasn t going to be a hug,  Wittes said.  It was bad enough there was going to be a handshake. And Comey has long arms so Comey said he pre-emptively reached out for a handshake and grabbed the president s hand. But Trump pulled him into an embrace and Comey didn t reciprocate. If you look at the video, it s one person shaking hands and another hugging. Lucky for us, this classic moment was caught on video: Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",Fake
" Obama SHAMES The Hell Out Of Trump And His Heartless Fans By Meeting This Young Boy President Obama has shown he s a human being with compassion time and again. Most recently, he met a 12-year old boy with severe cerebral palsy who had just been at a Trump rally the day before. What happened to him at the rally is exactly why Trump fans are deplorable, but Obama showed them how to act like humans, even if they aren t capable of it.J.J. Holmes braved one of Trump s rallies in order to protest the way that Trump makes fun of people with disabilities. Since he was a protester, he was very unwelcome already, but when Trump identified him and started saying,  Get them out,  security began trying to usher them away while Trump s deplorables pushed and kicked his wheelchair, according to J.J. s mother, Alison.Alison spoke to a pool reporter from the White House, saying,  We were put out by security,  and  The crowd started chanting  U-S-A  and pushing his wheelchair.  As she said that, her son kept saying,  I hate Donald Trump, I hate Donald Trump,  through his vocalization device.The Trumpkins proved beyond any doubt that they have a black abyss where their hearts should be with that vile act.Trump has come under fire before for mocking disabled people, most specifically when he made fun of Serge Kovalesky, who works for The New York Times and suffers from a chronic condition that s immobilized his right arm. Of course, he denied he was making fun of anyone, let alone someone with a disability, but that s par for the course for Trump.He and his loyal subjects literally care nothing about anyone but themselves. And his fans are deluded   he ll hurt them as much as he ll hurt the rest of the country in his quest to prove his  legitimacy  and gather power. Would Trump ever do this?Yesterday, this young man was kicked out of a Trump rally. As he was leaving, people kicked at his wheelchair. Today, he met his President. pic.twitter.com/VI4g2tKANG  Steve Schale (@steveschale) November 6, 2016Doubtful. Very, very doubtful.Featured image via screen capture from embedded tweet",Fake
" One Of Hillaryâ€™s Opponents Could Drop Out And Endorse Her (VIDEO) Every four years, we re told that the upcoming presidential election is the most important in our lifetimes. While it does seem that every election cycle the consequences become much more serious, this one is particularly notable because, regardless of politics, it s a clear choice between sane and insane.Donald Trump is insane. Obviously, we re not saying that in a clinical way because fortunately, we ve never met him, but he s thin-skinned, narcissistic, a pathological liar and doesn t give a crap about anyone other than himself. Politics aside, those qualities should keep him out of office.While there are a number of third party candidates running this time around, only one third party ticket is on the ballot in all 50 states and Washington, D.C., and that s the Libertarian ticket of Gary Johnson and his vice presidential candidate Bill Weld.Famed Watergate journalist Carl Bernstein believes the Johnson/Weld ticket might not hold up for long, and that Weld could be dropping out of the race to support Hillary Clinton.The Green Party ticket is on the ballot in 40 states and Washington, D.C. The Libertarian ticket is currently polling at 9 percent and the Green Party ticket is polling at 3 percent. Many are saying that the third party tickets are siphoning votes from Hillary Clinton, not Donald Trump and according to Bernstein, Weld might not be able to live with that fact. He has  another day to fight for libertarianism,  according to Bernstein. He also believes that Weld could help bring Millennials into the Democratic fold. Bill Weld does not want to be Ralph Nader,   says Bernstein. Nader, as you recall, ran against Al Gore and George W. Bush in 2000 and many say that Gore would have won if Nader had not been in the race.Bernstein also feels that Weld is spinning his wheels on the Johnson ticket. He called Johnson a  flake,  and said that Weld wants to make a difference and the difference he can make is supporting Clinton.Here s the video:Could Libertarian VP candidate renounce his candidacy?

"Venezuela's Maduro defends disputed vote, opposition divided CARACAS (Reuters) - President Nicolas Maduro defended Venezuelaâ€™s â€œsecureâ€ election system on Tuesday as opponents struggled to present a united front over allegations of fraud in a nationwide vote surprisingly won by the ruling socialists.  Despite widespread anger over economic hardship, the Socialist Party confounded opinion polls to take 17 of 23 governorships in Sundayâ€™s election.  Stunned by the defeat that undermines their aim to win the presidency in 2018, the opposition Democratic Unity coalition refused to acknowledge the results and called the election rigged, as did the United States. Though the coalition has complained of an unfair playing field - from abuse of state resources to last-minute moving of vote centers away from opposition strongholds - it has not given detailed evidence of ballot-tampering. Some opposition figures have acknowledged abstention by their supporters - disillusioned by the failure of street protests to dislodge Maduro earlier this year - was a big factor. Two losing opposition candidates, Henri Falcon in Lara state and Alejandro Feo La Cruz in Carabobo, have conceded defeat, breaking with the official coalition position. Both criticized â€œirregularitiesâ€ in the vote but also lamented many demoralized opposition supporters stayed at home. â€œWe need courage to recognize truth in adversity,â€ said Falcon. The strongest criticism of Sundayâ€™s vote came from Washington, which slammed Maduroâ€™s â€œdictatorship.â€ Several European nations also expressed concern, while 12 countries in the Americas from the so-called Lima Group condemned â€œobstacles, intimidation, manipulation and irregularitiesâ€. Washington is considering further sanctions on Venezuela, after various measures against top officials and the economy earlier this year, while the European Union is mulling the same. Government leaders have smarted at fraud accusations. â€œVenezuelaâ€™s election system is the most secure and audited in the world,â€ Maduro said on Tuesday. â€œPresident Donald Trump, I am not a dictator; I am a humble worker ... I have a moustache and look like Stalin, but Iâ€™m not him.â€ The Venezuelan leader invited EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini to visit or receive him in Brussels to â€œopen their eyes,â€ and told â€œstupidâ€ Canada to stop meddling. Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza later said on Twitter that Maduro had recalled Venezuelaâ€™s ambassador to Canada for talks. Heaping further humiliation on Venezuelaâ€™s opposition, the governors were due to be sworn in on Tuesday by a new legislative superbody elected controversially in July. The opposition boycotted that vote and has refused to recognize the entirely pro-government Constituent Assembly, which supersedes all institutions including the opposition-controlled congress. The oppositionâ€™s five governors-elect planned to boycott the swearing-in ceremony, defying Maduroâ€™s threat to bar them from office for failing to accept the assembly as a higher authority. â€œWe will not kneel to anyone,â€ said Juan Pablo Guanipa, who won the oil-rich western Zulia state.  Despite food shortages, runaway inflation and a tanking currency, Venezuelaâ€™s government retains significant bastions of support, especially in poorer, rural parts of the country. In his news conference, Maduro said the socialists also won Bolivar state, which would take its total to 18 governorships versus five for the opposition.  The government won a total of 54 percent of the votes overall, he added. The election board has not confirmed the Bolivar result or the overall vote figures. With the opposition coalitionâ€™s dozens of parties arguing over whether there was fraud, what went wrong, and where to go next, it will need to regroup and map strategy quickly heading into the 2018 presidential campaign. Its very future may even be in doubt, since many young activists who took to the streets for four straight months of protests and pitched battles with security forces earlier this year feel betrayed by their leaders. The unrest killed at least 125 people. Maduro has long accused opposition leaders of being behind violence, and on Tuesday called the new opposition governor of Zulia state a â€œfascistâ€ while accusing his counterpart in Tachira of links to Colombian â€œparamilitaries.â€ The election aftermath appears to have sunk a government-opposition mediation effort that began last month in the Dominican Republic. Even though Maduro wants to resuscitate the talks, the opposition coalition has ruled that out. â€œWe are the majority, the dictatorship is more-and-more illegitimate, popular and global condemnation grows daily against this regime,â€ it said in a communique late on Monday.

" WATCH: Fox News Gets OWNED By Police Chief For Demonizing Immigrants In Minnesota The hosts of Fox & Friends were hoping a Minnesota police chief would vilify the Somali immigrants in his community and they promptly got their asses handed to them.On Saturday, 22-year-old Dahir A. Adan went on a stabbing spree inside a Minnesota mall. The Somali community in St. Cloud has roundly condemned the act of terrorism, but Republican nominee Donald Trump spewed fear and hate in response during a phone call with Fox and called the immigrants a  Trojan horse  and a  cancer from within  that benefits ISIS.Fox host Steve Doocy, who was named in Gretchen Carlson s sexual harassment lawsuit against the conservative network, asked St. Cloud Police Chief William Blair Anderson if he agrees with Trump s assessment of immigrants, clearly hoping that Anderson would join in demonizing them.Instead, Anderson swatted Doocy down like the pest he is and made it clear that there are bad apples in every group and that we should unite rather than divide and hate. My job is public safety. It s not in immigration policy. I can tell you that the vast majority of all of our citizens, no matter their ethnicity, are fine, hard-working people, and now is not the time for us to be divisive. We already have a very cohesive community, and I expect that this will draw us even closer together. But at the end of the day, our job is public safety, period. Anderson then explained that law enforcement works well with all members of the community to protect the public the best they can. We actually work very well not just with our East African community, but all of our community. We meet regularly with any number of people, whether they are advocates for a specific ethnicity or different cause. It s one of things that makes St. Cloud a wonderful place to live, and I know that might sound corny, but it s the truth. We have established and maintained a very good rapport with our East African community and our community at large. Doocy then tucked his tail between his legs and ended the interview because he didn t get the response he wanted.Here s the video via Media Matters:Demonizing an entire community simply because of the actions of a few only ostracizes them and could cause more to radicalize. That s why we should reach out to these immigrants instead of hating them.Fox News is irresponsibly pushing an  us versus them  mentality that only creates a never-ending circle of hate and mistrust that hurts our country in the long-term. But let s also remember that ISIS would not exist to recruit people in America in the first place had Republicans not pursued an unnecessary war in Iraq that created the power vacuum that allowed ISIS to rise. Furthermore, despite their concerns and their whining, Republicans still refuse to declare war on ISIS to give President Obama the full resources of the United States to fight the terrorist organization.Regardless, any group will have bad apples, even the white  Christians  Fox News caters to. Let s not forget that Timothy McVeigh committed the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 that killed 168 people while Dylan Roof gunned down nine black people inside a church in 2015. Both acts of domestic terrorism were committed by white males who were born here in the United States. But Fox News would rather freak out about a Somali immigrant who used a knife in an attack in which no one was killed. If Adan were white, not only would this not be referred to as an act of terror, it would have been a mere footnote in the news.Featured Image: Screenshot",Fake
"Special prosecutor creation seen easing U.S. Congress partisanship: Senator Cornyn WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Justice Departmentâ€™s decision to name a special prosecutor to investigate Russiaâ€™s involvement in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections could ease red-hot partisan tensions in Congress, Senator John Cornyn, the second-ranking Republican in the Senate, said on Wednesday. Cornyn, speaking to reporters immediately after ex-FBI Director Robert Mueller was named as the special prosecutor, also said the announcement could make it easier for the Senate to confirm President Donald Trumpâ€™s replacement of fired FBI Director James Comey and said former Senator Joe Lieberman would get widespread support among the 100 senators for confirmation, if he were to be nominated. (This version of the story corrects second paragraph to make clear that Lieberman has not been nominated) ",Real
" Five Struggles Working Americans Face That Trump Will NEVER Understand In 2015, shortly after Donald Trump announced that he d be running for president, I went to one of his rallies in Sarasota, Florida. While standing outside of the rally it struck me as hilarious that the people who attended genuinely believed this self-proclaimed multi-billionaire was just like them. When Trump s helicopter flew over our heads with his name scrawled across it and he offered his supporters  children rides in his chopper, it cemented the fact that he was totally just like them! It was one of the most bizarre experiences of my life, and I live in Florida so that says a lot.In the months since that day, the same narrative has been repeated far and wide. At the Republican National Convention, Trump s daughter Ivanka told the GOP that her dad was the  people s champion. There is a Facebook page called  Trump  The People s President and there are blue-collar workers all over the country who think the real estate mogul is  just like us.  These people think that just because he is a loudmouth who lacks a vocal filter that he is some kind of  everyman,  but he s not.So, we have decided to compose a list of some of the things the working poor face every day that Trump has never had to deal with in his life.It is a fact that nowadays there is no chance of upward mobility without an education. This reality is the reason why Democrats are fighting so hard to make college free or at the very least, affordable, for every American. Although parents know that the only chance their kids have of achieving success is by going to college, when you are living below or just above the poverty line there is no way you can put money away for their college education. This is the reason we have 1.3 trillion dollars in student loan debt in the country and a student loan debt crisis. Donald Trump, however, has no idea what this is like. All of his children went to prestigious schools (the Wharton School and Georgetown) and so did he. He doesn t know the guilt you experience as a parent when you see your child stressed out about their mounting debt. He absolutely cannot wrap his mind around this and he isn t even talking about it in his campaign which proves that not only does he not understand it, he doesn t care.According to a 2015 Pew Research study, 11 percent of Americans said they take public transportation on a regular basis. The people who take the bus or subway on a regular basis are also more likely to be minorities or elderly who live below the poverty line:Among urban residents, 34% of blacks and 27% of Hispanics report taking public transit daily or weekly, compared with only 14% of whites. Foreign-born urban residents are more likely than urban dwellers born in the U.S. to regularly use public transportation (38% vs. 18%).Meanwhile, Trump  the everyman  flies around the country in a jet or uses a chauffeured car. This man has absolutely no idea what it feels like to wake up three hours before his shift at work so that he can make sure that he is on time. He has no idea what it is like to wait for the bus in a thunder or snow storm. He has no idea what it is like to sit next to weirdos who invade your personal space and stare at you. He has no idea what it is like to worry about whether or not he will have the $1.50 it costs to ride the bus. And again he isn t talking about this on the campaign trail and he is against raising the minimum wage.Since President Obama s Affordable Healthcare Act went into effect millions of Americans finally have the medical insurance they desperately need, but many still do not. More than 28 million people are still without insurance in our country. That means millions of people are not getting the annual physical exams they need to stay healthy this is not something Trump has to deal with. He has been seeing the same doctor for thirty years and even if he did not have medical insurance he could just pay his doctor bills without a second thought.Further, even though 9 in 10 Americans now have health coverage, that does not mean they have dental coverage:The Affordable Care Act (ACA) made dental care a required benefit for children s insurance, but it did not extend this requirement to insurance for adults. Therefore, many adults who buy non-group insurance may still have no dental coverage. In 2008, nearly 70 percent of people who bought health insurance on their own did not have dental coverage. And without dental coverage, many adults struggle to get the dental care they need.Trump has never woken up in the middle of the night in excruciating pain with a swollen face because of his inability to afford the dentist. He has never had to ask friends and family for money to have oral surgery. He has never searched his cabinets for old antibiotics. He has no fucking idea what that is like and wants to repeal the ACA.For millions of Americans the only way to survive is to apply for government assistance. The vast majority of the 52 million people receive help are hardworking Americans who just have too much month at the end of their money. They pay their taxes, work multiple jobs sometimes and just cannot stay afloat without help. And let me tell you, applying for it is the worst. Donald Trump has no idea what it is like to sit on pins and needles hoping the government deems you worthy of being able to purchase food. He has no idea what it feels like to go to bed hungry; and ironically, if he was ever put into a situation where he needed a hand up, he d be one of those  moochers  his party talks about all the time. You know the one, the person the GOP claims doesn t pay taxes but  expects  a hand out. Well, Trump hasn t paid taxes in almost 20 years making him the ultimate moocher.By now you have all heard about Donald Trump s visit to Flint, Michigan last month. Trump wanted the people of that city to know that he was on their side. His visit to the city came almost a year after America found out that the state had been poisoning the mostly African-American residents of the city for two years with lead-contaminated water. Trump, the guy who lives in penthouses and mansions has absolutely no idea what it is like to worry about drinking poisoned water. This is a very real struggle for not just the people of Flint, but in every state across the country according to reports. The idea that he can relate to this struggle is as preposterous as his visit to Flint. Furthermore, Trump is an anti-regulation Republican, so there is no chance in Hell that he is going to prevent this from happening in other cities around the country if elected.These are just five of the ways Trump is nothing like us, but there are many more. Trump also has no idea what it is like to run out of toothpaste or toilet paper and not have the money to buy more. He has no idea what it is like to look at his children and tell them that he cannot afford a $5 toy. He has no idea what it is like to not be able to get his children a pet because he cannot afford the vet bills. He has no idea what it is like to watch his children go off to war so that they can hopefully live through it and get a free education. He has no idea what it is like to go hungry, go without heat, go without shoes or any of the other things Americans face every single day.He is NOTHING like us and we must do everything we possibly can to keep him out of the White House.Featured image via Ethan Miller/Getty Images",Fake

"Trump says Iran complying with nuclear deal but remains dangerous threat WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trumpâ€™s administration on Monday declared that Iran was complying with its nuclear agreement with world powers, but warned that Tehran was in default of the spirit of the accord and that Washington would look for ways to strengthen it. It was the second time Trump certified Iranian compliance with the agreement since he took office in January, despite criticizing it during the 2016 campaign as â€œthe worst deal ever.â€ Trump administration officials, briefing reporters on Monday on the decision, said new economic sanctions against Iran were being prepared over its ballistic missile program and for contributing to regional tensions. Under U.S. law, the State Department must notify Congress every 90 days of Iranâ€™s compliance with the so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Trump had faced a congressionally mandated deadline of Monday to decide. A senior administration official said Iran was judged in compliance of the 2015 nuclear deal but that Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson believed Iran â€œremains one of the most dangerous threats to U.S. interests and to regional stability.â€ The official ticked off a list of accusations about Iranian behavior in the region, including ballistic missile development and proliferation, support for terrorism and militancy, complicity in atrocities committed in Syria and threats to Gulf waterways. â€œThe president and the secretary of state judge that these Iranian activities severely undermine the intent of the JCPOA, which was to contribute to regional and international peace and security. As a result, the president, the secretary of state and the entire administration judge that Iran is unquestionably in default of the spirit of the JCPOA,â€ the official said. The landmark deal struck with Iran by the United States, France, Britain, Russia, China and Germany is aimed at preventing Tehran from developing a nuclear weapon by imposing time-limited restrictions and strict international monitoring on its nuclear program. In return, Tehran won relief from punishing international economic sanctions. Iran denies seeking nuclear arms. The U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, concluded in December 2015, however, that Iran worked on the design of a missile-borne nuclear warhead until 2009. While lifting nuclear-linked sanctions, the United States maintains sanctions related to Iranâ€™s ballistic missile program, human rights record and what Washington charges is its support for international terrorism.  The senior administration official said the Trump administration intended to employ a strategy that would â€œaddress the totality of Iranâ€™s malign behaviorâ€ and not just focus on the Iran nuclear agreement. The administration is also looking at ways to strengthen the nuclear deal and more strictly enforce it, the official said, citing concerns that the deal over time would let Iran openly pursue industrial-scale nuclear fuel enrichment. â€œWeâ€™re in a period where weâ€™re going to be working with our allies to explore options for addressing the JCPOAâ€™s flaws, which there are many,â€ the official said.

Hughes responded on Twitter by playing the victim as if she did nothing wrong by casually making threats to someone she considers a friend. No messages from you sorry or I would have responded that MW and I have had friendly convos since 14. Sorry. I guess I misunderstood how polite our friendship was and very disappointed he has that low of respect for me. Threatening to smear a person s reputation is not what any good friend does. But that s what Hughes did even though Williams was found totally innocent of the allegations against him. Hughes deserved to be humiliated in public, and by sharing the threat publicly, Williams showed the world just how low Trump s minions are willing to sink.Featured image via Facebook",Fake
" Melania Trump Makes SHOCKING Admission Disqualifying Her Husband From Office Most sane people have been extremely alarmed that we have a toddler in a 70-year-old man s body at the top of a major party s presidential nominee. That person is, of course, Republican Donald J. Trump.  Trump has managed to do a million things that would have destroyed any other candidate s campaign, but still he powered on to win the GOP nomination.During this travesty of a campaign, Trump s wife Melania has largely been absent from the campaign trail. She has been visible at the debates in the family box, of course, but hasn t said a word since she was humiliated by giving a conventions speech that was plagiarized from First Lady Michelle Obama s 2008 speech at the Democratic National Convention. Now, in the wake of her husband humiliating her entire family by being caught on a hot mic having a horrifically lewd and offensive conversation about women with then-Access Hollywood host Billy Bush, Melania Trump is breaking her silence.She sat down to discuss the tape and her husband s behavior with CNN s Anderson Cooper, in which while she said the language used by both men was  unacceptable,  Melania seemed to take a  boys will be boys  angle on the whole thing, and even took the whole thing a bit further by literally calling her 70-year-old husband a kid. Here is the exchange, via The Hill: It s kinda like two teenage boys   actually they should behave better, right?  the potential first lady said about her husband and former  Access Hollywood  host Billy Bush. He was 59,  Cooper said. Correct,  Trump responded. Sometimes I said I have two boys at home   I have my young son and I have my husband,  Trump said.  I know how some men talk. That s how I saw it. Melania Trump went on to say: We talk a lot, a lot about the campaign. We talk about the language because I don t allow that he uses bad language.   But I tell him that, you know, there are consequences as well, and he   he needs to be careful [with the] language he uses. Unfortunately, I ve got news for Mrs. Trump. Her husband IS a kid, just as she alluded to herself. That alone should tell her what the rest of us already know: he should not be running for president.Watch the exchange below:Melania Trump on ""locker room talk"": ""I know how some men talk and that's how I saw it, yes"" https://t.co/IDm7N1ioh5 https://t.co/0UMZBrGmw5  CNN (@CNN) October 18, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",Fake
" This Compilation Of Alec Baldwin HUMILIATING Trump On SNL Will WRECK Trump New Yearâ€™s Eve Donald Trump threw a party to celebrate the New Year, so let s ruin his good time by looking back at the best of Alec Baldwin s masterful impersonations of him on Saturday Night Live.2016 was a tough year that most Americans would rather forget. We lost beloved musicians, actors, and childhood heroes. But 2016 was a good one for Alec Baldwin as he scored the role of a lifetime because of the stupidity of Donald Trump.Once the presidential debates rolled around in September, Baldwin stepped up and delivered a perfect performance as Trump. It has been so good, in fact, that Trump has whined about it on Twitter every time Baldwin has appeared on the show.Just tried watching Saturday Night Live   unwatchable! Totally biased, not funny and the Baldwin impersonation just can t get any worse. Sad  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 4, 2016I watched parts of @nbcsnl Saturday Night Live last night. It is a totally one-sided, biased show   nothing funny at all. Equal time for us?  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 20, 2016From his debate gaffes to his tweeting as president-elect, Baldwin took satire to a new hilarious level that nailed Trump as the bumbling Putin-loving buffoon he has always been.Here s the video via YouTube.And just think, Baldwin will have four more years to play the role as the real Trump fumbles American foreign and domestic policy every day as he pretends to be the legitimately elected President of the United States.So while Trump is busy destroying the country, at least we can escape our grim reality for at least a few precious minutes every Saturday to watch Baldwin troll Trump with a portrayal that will make him lash out like a petulant child. That is, unless Trump goes full dictator and ends Saturday Night Live for making fun of him.Featured image via screenshot",Fake
"Pro-trade Republicans get nervous that NAFTA talks could fail MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Pro-trade Republicans in the U.S. Congress are growing worried that U.S. President Donald Trump may try to quit the NAFTA free trade deal entirely rather than negotiate a compromise that preserves its core benefits. As a fifth round of talks to modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement kicked off in Mexico on Friday, several Republicans interviewed by Reuters expressed concerns that tough U.S. demands, including a five-year sunset clause and a U.S.-specific content rule, will sink the talks and lead to the dealâ€™s collapse. Business groups have warned of dire economic consequences, including millions of jobs lost as Mexican and Canadian tariffs snap back to their early 1990s levels.  â€œI think the administration is playing a pretty dangerous game with this sunset provision,â€ said Representative Charlie Dent, a moderate Republican from eastern Pennsylvania. He said putting NAFTA under threat of extinction every five years would make it difficult for companies in his district, ranging from chocolate giant Hershey Co to small family owned manufacturing firms, to invest in supply chains and manage global operations. Hershey operates candy plants in Monterrey and Guadalajara, Mexico. Some 74 House of Representatives members signed a letter this week opposing U.S. proposals on automotive rules of origin, which would require 50 percent U.S. content in NAFTA-built vehicles and 85 percent regional content. They warned that this would â€œeliminate the competitive advantagesâ€ that NAFTA brings to U.S. automakers or lead to a collapse of the trade pact. Representative Pete Sessions, a Texas Republican who has long been a supporter of free trade deals, said he disagreed with the Trump approach of â€œtrying to beat someoneâ€ in the NAFTA talks. Texas is the largest U.S. exporting state with nearly half of its $231 billion in exports last year headed to Mexico and Canada, according to Commerce Department data. â€œWe need to offer Mexico a fair deal. If we want them to take our cattle, we need to take their avocados,â€ Sessions said. Still, congressional apprehension about Trumpâ€™s stance is far from unanimous. The signers were largely Republicans, with no Democrats from auto-intensive states such as Michigan and Ohio signing. Some pro-labor Democrats have actually expressed support for U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizerâ€™s tough approach. â€œSome of those demands are in tune,â€ said Representative Bill Pascrell of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the House Ways and Means trade subcommittee. â€œWe donâ€™t want to blow it up, Republicans donâ€™t want to blow it up. But we want substantial changes in the labor, the environmental, the currency, on how you come to an agreement when thereâ€™s a dispute, and on problems of origin.â€ Farm state Republicans are especially concerned that a collapse of NAFTA would lead to the loss of crucial export markets in Mexico and Canada for corn, beef and other products.  Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa said Lighthizer in a recent meeting agreed that a withdrawal from NAFTA would be hard on U.S. agriculture, which has largely benefited from the trade pact. U.S. agricultural exports to Canada and Mexico quintupled to about $41 billion in 2016 from about $9 billion in 1993, the year before NAFTA went into effect, according to U.S. Commerce Department data. Grassley said, however, that Lighthizerâ€™s approach was â€œtaking everybody to the brink on these talks.â€ Other Republicans are taking a wait and see approach to the talks. Representative Frank Lucas of Oklahoma said he was willing to give Trump â€œthe benefit of the doubtâ€ on NAFTA talks, adding that farmers and ranchers in his rural district were strong Trump supporters in the 2016 election. â€œThe presidentâ€™s a practical fellow. When push comes to shove, he understands the base,â€ Lucas said. ",Real

" WATCH: Michael Steele CALLS OUT Trump For Attacking Civil Rights Icon Rep. John Lewis Former RNC chair Michael Steele did not mince words when he called out Donald Trump on Saturday.Rep. John Lewis, who nearly sacrificed his life fighting for voting rights in Selma, Alabama during the Civil Right Movement, remarked on Friday during an interview with Chuck Todd that he doesn t believe Trump is a legitimate president. I believe in trying to work with people,  Lewis said.  It will be hard. It s going to be very difficult. I don t see this president-elect as a legitimate president. Of course, Trump s ego couldn t handle the truth so he lashed out in the most embarrassing way.Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 14, 2017mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results. All talk, talk, talk   no action or results. Sad!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 14, 2017Trump literally accused Lewis of being  all talk  and  no action. Unlike Trump, Lewis has spent his life fighting for equality and civil rights. He was even nearly beaten to death for it. Meanwhile, Trump has never fought for a damn thing except for himself.Trump s attack on Lewis also coincides with Martin Luther King Day weekend, which made his attack all the more offensive, and Steele put Trump in his place during an appearance on MSNBC. Number one, don t tweet that. Number two, don t go there. And number three, try and step back and appreciate what s being said,  Steele advised Trump.  You can put it in a partisan context. You know,  He s a Democrat, I m a Republican. He s black, I m white.  It goes to what you were just saying, what s undergirding that? Steele then reminded Trump that if he really wants to heal wounds and bridge divides that he needs to include African-Americans. Instead, Trump just widened that divide by attacking a civil rights legend. If you re looking to heal and bridge, and bring people of America together, well, we re a part of that. As black folks, we re apart of that. Our expectation is, not only will you attempt that same effort that you would to white folks in other communities, but that you will show respect for our leadership, those who do represent our interests. You know, the tweet is unnecessary. John Lewis has a walk that very few people in this country, least of all Donald Trump, have ever walked.

" 37 Mental Health Workers Are BEGGING Congress To Impeach Trump It s been a very, very bad day for the newly elected Donald Trump administration. First, amid revelations of Russian connections, his National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn, was forced to resign. Now, others may soon follow, but it s the big guy himself that has mental health professionals concerned and in an open letter in the New York Times, they begged that Congress and the media do something about it.The 37 mental health professionals, ranging from social workers to psychologists and psychiatrists have all violated the ethical code called the Goldwater Rule, which is a self-imposed ban on diagnosing public officials. Frankly, though, there hasn t been such a high-level politician who s been putting us in as much danger as Trump is (at least not since the resignation of Richard M. Nixon), so they felt it was time to speak out.While the letter doesn t diagnose Trump with a specific mental illness (like malignant narcissism), they are more generally concerned with Trump s delusions of grandeur.Mr. Trump s speech and actions demonstrate an inability to tolerate views different from his own, leading to rage reactions. His words and behavior suggest a profound inability to empathize. Individuals with these traits distort reality to suit their psychological state, attacking facts and those who convey them (journalists, scientists).In a powerful leader, these attacks are likely to increase, as his personal myth of greatness appears to be confirmed. We believe that the grave emotional instability indicated by Mr. Trump s speech and actions makes him incapable of serving safely as president.Others have gone even further.In a bid to warn the public, psychologists are publishing their diagnoses of Trump. Most recently, John D. Gartner said Trump  is dangerously mentally ill and temperamentally incapable of being president. He believes Trump shows signs of  malignant narcissism,  which is defined as a mix of narcissism, antisocial personality disorder, aggression and sadism in Campbells  Psychiatric Dictionary.In December, three psychiatry professors wrote to President Obama, calling Trump  mentally unstable. His widely reported symptoms of mental instability   including grandiosity, impulsivity, hypersensitivity to slights or criticism, and an apparent inability to distinguish between fantasy and reality   lead us to question his fitness for the immense responsibilities of the office,  the professors from Harvard Medical School and the University of California wrote to the then President, urging him to order a  full medical and neuropsychiatric evaluation  of the then President-elect.Unfortunately, Obama, who was probably aware that Trump was mentally unfit, had no legal recourse to do anything. Trump, however, is a clear and present danger to our country. His refusal to accept even the tiniest amount of dissent, his business conflicts and his Russian associations make it too dangerous for him to remain in office for another day. Unfortunately, we have a Republican Congress that puts party before country. They d rather see it burn down than to damage their mission of complete corporate reign.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images.",Fake
" Trump Finalizes Betrayal Of LGBT Community With First Speech To Hate Group By A President After a campaign in which he shamelessly pandered to the LGBT community, Donald Trump has betrayed them so completely that his prior rhetoric is all but unrecognizable. He is slated to speak at the  Values Voters Summit  on Friday, hosted by the hate group Family Research Council and their extremist president Tony Perkins, a man who believes that gays should be put to death.The speech Trump gave at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July 2016 came just one month after the deadly shooting at the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando Florida. That hate crime, sometimes referred to as a terrorist attack based on the religion of the perpetrator, claimed the lives of 49 mostly Latino gay club-goers and wounded 58 more. It was the first time Facebook s Safety Check feature was ever used inside the United States, with users marking themselves as  safe  to let family and friends know they were okay.Although witnesses at Pulse said they remembered the attacker being a patron of the bar   perhaps a jilted lover, even   Trump took the opportunity in that Cleveland speech to make a vow to his LGBT voters:  As your president, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology.  And what did those voters look like?Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty ImagesThey looked like kids who believed him.The man who became the first Republican to even mention the LGBT crowd at a national convention went on to reverse himself in every way possible.He had already said earlier that year that transgender people should use  the bathroom that they feel is appropriate.  At a Colorado rally in October, Trump waved a rainbow flag with the phrase  LGBTs For Trump  scrawled across the middle.But all of his promises, all of his platitudes, were meaningless.He unilaterally made the decision to expel transgender soldiers from the military, then lied about it, saying that he had consulted with military leaders about the issue. He revoked Obama-era bathroom guidelines that favored the community in public schools. He went so far as to remove the entire section on LGBTQ rights from the official White House website.Now that Trump s Justice Department, under the bigoted tutelage of notoriously anti-gay asshole Jeff Sessions, has asserted that it is legal to actually discriminate against transgender employees, you d think that Donald Trump would make sure the statement on the White House site in which he vowed to uphold protections for them would be taken down out of shame, or at least consistency. He can t be bothered.So what does it mean that Trump is the very first president to speak at the Values Voters Summit? It means that his hypocrisy has come full circle. It means that his lies are all finally exposed. It means that he is shameless enough to not only adopt religion in order to solidify his base, but to pander to even the extremist wing of that religion, even if they openly advocate for the persecution of the community Donald Trump once promised to protect.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",Fake
"Congress ends effort to kill limits on debit card fees Washington (Reuters) - Banks were regrouping on Thursday, a day after being handed a large defeat in the U.S. House, where Republicans sided with retailers in agreeing to preserve limits on debit card fees. The financial industry insisted it was not done fighting to remove limits on the fees. Retailers were already looking to carry the fight to credit card fees. â€œWe are glad this fight is over, and are happy with our victory,â€ said Austen Jensen with the Retail Industry Leaders Association. â€œThe banks should clearly know that this is over with.â€ â€œThis debate is not over,â€ said Rob Nichols, president and CEO of the American Bankers Association. The House had been considering a broad financial reform bill that included a repeal of the Durbin amendment, which established the limits on debit card fees. The limits were backed by Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois when the Dodd-Frank financial reform law was enacted in 2010. The effort to remove the card fee limits had drawn strong opposition in the House. Representative Jeb Hensarling, the billâ€™s author, announced Wednesday he would end the effort to eliminate the Durbin amendment because he did not want to see his entire finance bill upended. â€œIâ€™ve said before that repeal of the Durbin amendment was the most contentious part of the bill among Republicans,â€ he said in a statement. â€œWe wonâ€™t let this one provision hinder passage of an important priority bill.â€ The full House is expected to vote on Hensarlingâ€™s bill in the coming weeks, but there is enough opposition in the Senate that it will probably not become law. The feud over government caps on the fees retailers pay when accepting debit cards has run red hot ever since the limits were imposed. With billions of dollars in revenue at stake, banks and retailers have battled nearly constantly in Washington. Retailers have argued the cap is critical to control sky-high costs imposed by a handful of card servicers, while banks insist the limit represents government meddling in private industry. Nichols said limiting debit card fees was â€œwrong and Congress should fix it.â€ Under Dodd-Frank, the Federal Reserve was ordered to set limits on how much Visa and Mastercard could charge for processing debit card transactions. The end result nearly halved fees received by banks, dropping the cost of a debit card transaction from an average of 45 cents to an average of 24 cents. ",Real

" Trump Gave HIGHLY Classified Information To Russian Ambassador Right After Firing Comey Whoa. The day after he fired now-former FBI Director James Comey, Donald Trump did perhaps the dumbest thing a person under investigation for collusion with Russia could possibly do: he gave highly classified information directly to representatives of the Russian government. How classified? It s stuff we haven t even shown our allies.The Washington Post reports that when Trump met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, Trump  went off script and began describing details about an Islamic State terrorist threat related to the use of laptop computers on aircraft. I get great intel. I have people brief me on great intel every day,  Trump bragged to the Russians according to a White House official:Trump went on to discuss aspects of the threat that the United States only learned through the espionage capabilities of a key partner. He did not reveal the specific intelligence gathering method, but described how the Islamic State was pursuing elements of a specific plot and how much harm such an attack could cause under varying circumstances. Most alarmingly, officials said, Trump revealed the city in the Islamic State s territory where the U.S. intelligence partner detected the threat.The Washington Post is withholding most plot details, including the name of the city, at the urging of officials who warned that revealing them would jeopardize important intelligence capabilities. Everyone knows this stream is very sensitive and the idea of sharing it at this level of granularity with the Russians is troubling,  a former senior U.S. counter-terrorism official who worked with Team Trump told the Post. Russia, armed with the information Trump handed them, can now use it to identify the U.S. ally or gain more information about intelligence operations. This is code-word information,  the official said.  Trump revealed more information to the Russian ambassador than we have shared with our own allies.  One official tells Buzzfeed that   it s far worse than what has already been reported. Russia could identify our sources or techniques,  the senior U.S. official explained. I don t think that it would be that hard [for Russian spy services] to figure this out. If that partner learned we d given this to Russia without their knowledge or asking first that is a blow to that relationship,  the official said, adding that Trump also informed the Kremlin about defensive measures the United States has taken. I m sure Kislyak was able to fire off a good cable back to the Kremlin with all the details. The meeting, which occurred just after The Donald fired James Comey for requesting additional resources for the Russia investigation, was off-limits to U.S. press, but Trump allowed Russian media in to take photographs. The White House readout does not discuss Trump s decision to give away our nation s secrets to the country that financed and executed a hacking a propaganda operation intended to install him in the Oval Office.Featured image via screengrab",Fake

"Turkey urges U.S. to review visa suspension as lira, stocks tumble ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey urged the United States on Monday to review its suspension of visa services after the arrest of a U.S. consulate employee sharply escalated tension between the two NATO allies and drove Turkeyâ€™s currency and stocks lower. Relations between Ankara and Washington have been plagued by disputes over U.S. support for Kurdish fighters in Syria, Turkeyâ€™s calls for the extradition of a U.S.-based cleric and the indictment of a Turkish former minister in a U.S. court. But last weekâ€™s arrest of a Turkish employee of the U.S. consulate in Istanbul marked a fresh low. Turkey said the employee had links to U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, blamed by Ankara for a failed military coup in July 2016. Gulen denies any connection with the coup. The U.S. embassy in Ankara condemned Ankaraâ€™s charges as baseless and announced on Sunday night it was halting all non-immigrant visa services in Turkey while it reassessed Turkeyâ€™s commitment to the security of its missions and staff. Within hours, Ankara announced it was taking the same measures against U.S. citizens seeking visas for Turkey. The U.S. ambassador said the duration of the visa servicesâ€™ suspension would depend on talks between the two governments about the reasons for the detention of local staff in Turkey. In a written statement late on Monday, Ambassador John Bass said the length of the suspension would also depend on â€œthe Turkish governmentâ€™s commitment to protecting our facilities and personnel here in Turkeyâ€. He noted that the move was not a visa ban on Turkish citizens, that valid visas could still be used and visa applications could be made outside of Turkey. The U.S. Embassy had been unable to learn the reasons for the arrest of its Turkish staff member last week or what evidence exists against the employee, Bass said, adding that he had not been allowed sufficient access to the employeeâ€™s lawyer. Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gul said that if Washington had serious security concerns about its missions in Turkey, steps would be taken to address them. â€œBut if itâ€™s an issue regarding the arrest of the consulate employee, then this is a decision the Turkish judiciary has made,â€ Gul told A Haber television. â€œTrying a Turkish citizen for a crime committed in Turkey is our right.â€ The Turkish foreign ministry summoned a U.S. diplomat to urge the United States to lift the visa services suspension, saying it was causing â€œunnecessary tensionsâ€, and President Tayyip Erdogan also criticized the U.S. move. â€œFor the (U.S.) embassy in Ankara to take such a decision and implement it, it is upsetting,â€ Erdogan told a news conference during a visit to Ukraine. State-run Anadolu news agency said another U.S. consulate worker had been summoned to testify over his wife and daughterâ€™s suspected links to Gulen - which it said had emerged during the questioning of Metin Topuz, the employee arrested last week. The diplomatic spat spooked investors. The lira dropped 3.4 percent and stood at 3.7385 against the dollar after being quoted overnight as touching a level of 3.9223. The main BIST 100 stock index fell as much as 4.7 percent, closing the day down 2.73 percent at 101,298 points. Airline shares were particularly hard hit, with flag carrier Turkish Airlines falling 9 percent. The central bank said it was following developments closely. â€œThis looks like a really serious situation,â€ said Blue Bay Asset Management strategist Timothy Ash. He added that the central bank would need to move quickly to calm market nerves and possibly hike interest rates - something Erdogan has resisted. Turkeyâ€™s leading business association, TUSIAD, warned that the dispute would harm bilateral economic, social and cultural ties, and called for disagreements to be settled calmly. The row with the United States coincides with deep strains in Turkeyâ€™s relations with Germany, another key ally, and with Turkish military activity at the Syrian and Iraqi borders, though their market impact has so far been limited. U.S.-Turkish tensions have risen in recent months over U.S. military support for Kurdish YPG fighters in Syria, considered by Ankara to be an extension of the banned PKK which has waged an insurgency for three decades in southeast Turkey. Turkey has also pressed, so far in vain, for the United States to extradite Gulen, viewed in Ankara as the mastermind behind the failed coup in which more than 240 people were killed.  Friction with the United States has also arisen from the indictment last month by a U.S. court of Turkeyâ€™s former economy minister Zafer Caglayan on charges of conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran.

"Russia denies Reuters report think tank drew up plan to sway U.S. election MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia dismissed as false on Thursday a Reuters report that said a government think tank controlled by President Vladimir Putin had developed a plan to swing the 2016 U.S. presidential election in Donald Trumpâ€™s favor. Reuters reported on Wednesday that the Moscow-based Russian Institute for Strategic Studies (RISS) had provided the framework and rationale for what U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded was an intensive effort by Russia to interfere with the Nov. 8 election. The Reuters report cited three current and four former U.S. officials who had acquired two documents prepared by the institute. Russia has repeatedly denied interfering in the U.S. election. The Kremlin and RISS did not respond to requests for comment on the documents before Wednesday, but on Thursday the think tank issued a statement saying the report was false. â€œIt seems, that in their conspiratorial consciousness the authors of this conceit did not weigh reality against their coveted fantasies, in order to once again draw attention to the theme ... of Russiaâ€™s â€˜participationâ€™ in the pre-election campaign in the United States,â€ said RISS Director Mikhail Fradkov.  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said people should not pay attention to reports based on anonymous sources. â€œI donâ€™t know anything about this, I can only say that seven anonymous sources are not worth one real one.â€ The documents obtained by the U.S. intelligence officials were central to the conclusion by the administration of Barack Obama that Russia mounted a â€œfake newsâ€ campaign and launched cyber attacks against Democratic Party groups and Hillary Clintonâ€™s campaign, the current and former officials said. That campaign began after Putin asked the institute to draw up a plan for interfering with the U.S. presidential race, said one of the sources, a former senior U.S. intelligence official. U.S. President Donald Trump has said Russiaâ€™s activities had no impact on the outcome of the race. Ongoing congressional and FBI investigations into Russian interference have so far produced no public evidence that Trump associates colluded with the Russian effort to change the outcome of the election.

" Unlike The President-Elect, Trumpâ€™s Own Lawyers Admit Thereâ€™s No Evidence Of Voter Fraud (IMAGES) Not-My-President-Elect Donald Trump s claim that millions of voters had cast illegal ballots on election day has become a contentious issue because there is zero evidence to back up such an assertion. Trump s Twitter timeline is the epitome of  fake news.  In ncourt filings submitted by Trump s own attorneys in Pennsylvania and Michigan objecting to recount efforts by Green Party candidate Jill Stein, it states that there is  no evidence that any voter fraud had occurred,  according to the Washington Post.The filing in Michigan states: On what basis does Stein seek to disenfranchise Michigan citizens? None really, save for speculation,  the filing reads.  All available evidence suggests that the 2016 general election was not tainted by fraud or mistake. The lawyers state,  Stein aims to sow doubts regarding the legitimacy of the presidential election.  That s pretty ironic considering that that is precisely what Trump tried to do for years during President Obama s two terms.In the Pennsylvania filing, the lawyers state,  On what basis does Stein seek to disenfranchise the voters of the Keystone state? None really. There is no evidence   or even any allegation   that any tampering with Pennsylvania s voting systems actually occurred. Trump s Republican colleagues have tried to reinforce the notion of mass voter fraud. Reince Priebus said that it was  possible.  House Speaker Paul Ryan said he didn t know if millions of illegal votes were cast, because said that he is  not really focused on these things. Not-My-Vice-President-Elect Mike Pence said that he didn t know that the claim was false. Senior Adviser Kellyanne Conway has twisted herself into a pretzel trying to justify Trump s baseless claim. Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) got into a heated exchange with CNN anchor Chris Cuomo on Monday over the number of illegal votes cast in the presidential election. All of this happened because Donald Trump can t maintain his Twitter account like an adult.Featured image via Tom Pennington/Getty ImagesImages of court filings via Washington Post",Fake
" Republicans Are Already Planning For Their Health Care Bill To Fail, Hereâ€™s Proof (DETAILS) After already having several massive failures under their belts as a result of Donald Trump s presidency, it sure doesn t seem like the Republican Party has much faith in the Senate s health care bill.So far, the GOP s attempt at repealing and replacing Obamacare has been one disaster after another, and the latest report from CNN shows that they might be preparing to fail one more time. It turns out, Republicans are currently trying to protect Trump from the health care bill s backlash if it fails by distancing Trump from the legislation. CNN reports:But White House top aides also see the distance as a way to inoculate Trump from considerable blame if the bill fails, a nod to the President s low approval rating and waning political capital. No one knows the Senate better than McConnell,  one White House official said when asked about Trump s involvement, an acknowledgment that he is taking the lead. A Republican Senate aide agreed. This is a leadership bill, sink or swim. All credit and all blame stays in the Senate,  the aide said, adding this political reality:  This gives the President cover, in a sense, if it fails. Now, in all fairness, the GOP might have chosen to keep Trump far away from this health care bill because the more he s involved in something, the worse the outcome is. It s extremely likely that Republicans feel that Trump will either say or do something to mess everything up, and that s why they don t want him getting his little orange hands in it. However, from the White House s perspective, the Trump administration is more than okay with this bill s possible (and likely) failure falling on Mitch McConnell instead of Trump, whose approval rating continues to dwindle.The separation of Trump from the GOP health care bill is a telling one, and it s one that the Republicans have done on their own. They must be sensing that the bill is in trouble, and are taking precautions to safeguard Trump.Featured image via Mark Wilson / Getty Images",Fake
"After pointed criticism, Tillerson urges Gulf demands be sent to Qatar WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States hopes Arab countries involved in a diplomatic split with Qatar will soon present Doha a list of â€œreasonable and actionableâ€ demands to move the crisis toward a resolution, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Wednesday. Tillersonâ€™s comments came in a short statement a day after the State Department bluntly questioned the motives of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in announcing their boycott of Qatar on June 5, saying it was â€œmystifiedâ€ the Gulf states had not released their grievances. It was Washingtonâ€™s strongest language yet on a dispute that erupted after the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic ties and transport links to isolate Qatar. The Arab countries accuse Qatar of funding terrorism, fomenting regional instability or cosying up to their enemy Iran. Qatar has denied the accusations. â€œWe understand a list of demands has been prepared and coordinated by the Saudis, Emiratis, Egyptians and Bahrainis,â€ the Tillerson statement said. â€œWe hope the list ... will soon be presented to Qatar and will be reasonable and actionable.â€ Tillerson also said the United States backs a Kuwaiti mediation effort aimed at resolving the crisis. Asked about the Qatar issue at a later news conference, Tillerson said the United States wanted to achieve unity among the Gulf Cooperation Council countries so that they can focus on the fight against Islamic State militants across the region. â€œOur role has been to encourage the parties to get their issues on the table, clearly articulated, so that those issues can be addressed and some resolution process can get under way to bring this to a conclusion,â€ Tillerson said. Qatar hosts a vital U.S. military base, Al Udeid, to which more than 11,000 U.S. and coalition forces are deployed or assigned and from which more than 100 aircraft operate. U.S. President Donald Trump has taken a tough stance on Qatar, accusing it of being a â€œhigh levelâ€ sponsor of terrorism, but he has also offered help to the parties in the dispute to resolve their differences.

" Anderson Cooper Demands Answers After Trumpâ€™s HUGE Mistake With Taiwan On Friday, Donald Trump broke a 37-year old pledge with China not to recognize Taiwan as a country and called its president. The reason? He wants to further pad his pockets by building a new luxury hotel in Taiwan. With just this one brief phone call, he has likely caused a diplomatic crisis, erasing all of the hard work Obama and other past presidents have done to keep China in our good graces.Friday night on CNN, Anderson Cooper spoke to former Trump campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, demanding answers after this enormous mistake that has left political observers speechless   evidently, it left Kellyanne Conway speechless as well, because she had no idea what to say.Right off the bat, Cooper lets loose on Conway, telling her that America  doesn t recognize Taiwan as its own nation,  and  doesn t support Taiwan independence.

" Dems Furious After Rosenstein Briefing Democrats are reportedly furious at deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein after a classified, closed-door meeting on Friday. The meeting was held to update members of the House of Representatives on the probe into the Trump campaign s ties with Russia, and to reassure members of the House that the newly-appointed special counsel has all the tools he needs at his disposal. Many Democrats clearly weren t swayed by Rosenstein s remarks. Rep. Seth Moulton (D-MA) spoke to the core of the Democratic representatives  issues with the briefing. After the meeting, he told reporters,  There was considerable frustration in the room. This renewed my confidence that we should not have confidence in this administration.

" Republicans Offered Condolences For Soviet Dictator Joseph Stalin When He Died Republicans need to stop whining about President Obama offering condolences for Fidel Castro s death, because they ve offered condolences for even worse monsters.After news of the longtime Cuban dictator s death, President Obama issued the following statement:At this time of Fidel Castro s passing, we extend a hand of friendship to the Cuban people. We know that this moment fills Cubans   in Cuba and in the United States   with powerful emotions, recalling the countless ways in which Fidel Castro altered the course of individual lives, families, and of the Cuban nation. History will record and judge the enormous impact of this singular figure on the people and world around him. Today, we offer condolences to Fidel Castro s family, and our thoughts and prayers are with the Cuban people. In the days ahead, they will recall the past and also look to the future. As they do, the Cuban people must know that they have a friend and partner in the United States of America.President Obama s statement was much different from Donald Trump s, which seemed to celebrate Castro s death. Indeed, Trump s statement is the kind of dangerous reaction that could damage international relations between nations at a time when we should be seeking peace.Republicans, of course, have been attacking President Obama ever since. Marco Rubio called Obama s statement  pathetic.  Ted Cruz says the United States should not send anyone to represent America at the funeral.But once again, just like they did when President Obama did not attend former First Lady Nancy Reagan s funeral, Republicans are conveniently forgetting history and precedent.As it turns out, the Republicans themselves sent condolences after a brutal dictator died on two occasions. In 1953, President Eisenhower offered condolences upon learning that Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin was near death.At this moment in history when multitudes of Russians are anxiously concerned because of the illness of the Soviet ruler2 the thoughts of America go out to all the people of the U.S.S.R. the men and women, the boys and girls in the villages, cities, farms and factories of their homeland.They are the children of the same God who is the Father of all peoples everywhere. And like all peoples, Russia s millions share our longing for a friendly and peaceful world.Regardless of the identity of government personalities, the prayer of us Americans continues to be that the Almighty will watch over the people of that vast country and bring them, in His wisdom, opportunity to live their lives in a world where all men and women and children dwell in peace and comradeship.That s right. Republicans sent condolences for a brutal dictator who murdered at least 10 million people and is known as one of the worst mass murderers of the 20th century.After Stalin died, Eisenhower even offered praise of Stalin and reached out to the Russian people in his  Chance for Peace  speech.The world knows that an era ended with the death of Joseph Stalin. The extraordinary 30-year span of his rule saw the Soviet Empire expand to reach from the Baltic Sea to the Sea of Japan, finally to dominate 800 million souls.The Soviet system shaped by Stalin and his predecessors was born of one World War. It survived with stubborn and often amazing courage a second World War. It has lived to threaten a third.Now a new leadership has assumed power in the Soviet Union. Its links to the past, however strong, cannot bind it completely. Its future is, in great part, its own to make.The United States was even represented at Stalin s funeral by U.S. Ambassador Jacob Beam.And when Mao Tse-tung died in September 1976, President Gerald Ford sent the following condolences: Mrs. Ford joins me in extending to you our deepest sympathy on the death of Chairman Mao Tse-tung. Chairman Mao had a profound impact on his era. . . . Please accept my personal condolences. So by attacking President Obama, Republicans are being total hypocrites. Yes, Fidel Castro was a terrible person. But he was still a human being and many people are mourning him in Cuba. Sending condolences is the human thing to do and it s the American way even if the foreign leader who died was our enemy. By extending our hand in friendship, we are sending a message to the Cuban people letting them know that we are with them and that we still want to work with them to make a better world for both of our nations. It s how diplomacy works. Petty statements like Trump s only do more harm than good.Featured image via Cagle",Fake
" WOW: Intercepted Communications Implicate Three Top Trump Advisors In Plot With Russia By now, you have probably heard that the FBI and five other intelligence agencies have, for months, been investigating ties between many of Trump s top-level people and Russia. On Thursday, The New York Times told us who it is:The counterintelligence investigation centers at least in part on the business dealings that some of the president-elect s past and present advisers have had with Russia. Mr. Manafort has done business in Ukraine and Russia. Some of his contacts there were under surveillance by the National Security Agency for suspected links to Russia s Federal Security Service, one of the officials said.Mr. Manafort is among at least three Trump campaign advisers whose possible links to Russia are under scrutiny. Two others are Carter Page, a businessman and former foreign policy adviser to the campaign, and Roger Stone, a longtime Republican operative.The F.B.I. is leading the investigations, aided by the National Security Agency, the C.I.A. and the Treasury Department s financial crimes unit. The investigators have accelerated their efforts in recent weeks but have found no conclusive evidence of wrongdoing, the officials said. One official said intelligence reports based on some of the wiretapped communications had been provided to the White House.Counterintelligence investigations examine the connections between American citizens and foreign governments. Those connections can involve efforts to steal state or corporate secrets, curry favor with American government leaders or influence policy. It is unclear which Russian officials are under investigation, or what particular conversations caught the attention of American eavesdroppers. The legal standard for opening these investigations is low, and prosecutions are rare.In short, it s unlikely that anyone will be charged, but we as Americans have every reason to be concerned with the people with whom Trump surrounds himself. Manafort, naturally, calls the allegations a Democrat Party dirty trick and completely false. I have never had any relationship with the Russian government or any Russian officials. I was never in contact with anyone, or directed anyone to be in contact with anyone,  he adds. On the  Russian hacking of the D.N.C.,  my only knowledge of it is what I have read in the papers.  Politifact confirmed last year that Manafort has many relationships with pro-Putin politicians in Ukraine at minimum.While Trump will attempt to connect this to the 35-page  pee pee dossier  published by Buzzfeed   the one handed to Trump and Obama by intelligence agencies   the FBI says that the decision to open the investigation was not based on those in the least:The F.B.I. investigation into Mr. Manafort began last spring, and was an outgrowth of a criminal investigation into his work for a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine and for the country s former president, Viktor F. Yanukovych. In August, The Times reported that Mr. Manafort s name had surfaced in a secret ledger that showed he had been paid millions in undisclosed cash payments. The Associated Press has reported that his work for Ukraine included a secret lobbying effort in Washington aimed at influencing American news organizations and government officials.Mr. Stone, a longtime friend of Mr. Trump s, said in a speech in Florida last summer that he had communicated with Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, the anti-secrecy group that published the hacked Democratic emails. During the speech, Mr. Stone predicted further leaks of documents, a prediction that came true within weeks.In a brief interview on Thursday, Mr. Stone said he had never visited Russia and had no Russian clients. He said that he had worked in Ukraine for a pro-Western party, but that any assertion that he had ties to Russian intelligence was  nonsense  and  totally false. The whole thing is a canard,  he said.  I have no Russian influences. The Senate intelligence committee has started its own investigation into Russia s purported attempts to disrupt the election. The committee s inquiry is broad, and will include an examination of Russian hacking and possible ties between people associated with Mr. Trump s campaign and Russia.Investigators are also scrutinizing people on the periphery of Mr. Trump s campaign, such as Mr. Page, a former Merrill Lynch banker who founded Global Energy Capital, an investment firm in New York that has done business with Russia.In an interview on Thursday, Mr. Page expressed bewilderment about why he might be under investigation. He blamed a smear campaign   that he said was orchestrated by Mrs. Clinton   for media speculation about the nature of his ties to Russia. I did nothing wrong, for the 5,000th time,  he said. His adversaries, he added, are  pulling a page out of the Watergate playbook. What further details will the investigation reveal? Only time will tell   but Donald Trump is now our President, and his cozy relationship with Vladimir Putin is terrifyingly clear. All you have to do is look at his Twitter account.Featured image via Getty Images (Chip Somodevilla/Win McNamee/Spencer Platt)",Fake
" BUSTED: Trump Supporters Get Caught Creating Fake Badges To Intimidate Voters At Polling Places Conservatives claim that voter ID is necessary to catch illegal voters, but it turns out they re the only ones creating fake IDs to use on Election Day.Trump supporters are taking Trump s call to monitor polling places so seriously that they are creating fake ID badges in order to infiltrate polling locations across the country and intimidate voters by interrogating them, confusing them, and filming them   all of which are illegal.But, Trump s deplorables are doing this in droves with the help of a right-wing group known as  Vote Protectors. The group, which is affiliated with top Trump ally Roger Stone, is giving people the ability to intimidate voters on Election Day. They are literally teaching them to create their own fake badge, which is designed to give them access to voters both inside and outside the polling places where citizens cast their votes.According to the Huffington Post,Stone s group created an official-looking ID badge for its volunteers to wear, and its volunteers planned to videotape voters and conduct fake  exit polls,  efforts that election experts say risks intimidating and confusing voters. Or at least that s what the group was planning to do before The Huffington Post asked Stone about it on Tuesday. The controversial Trump ally, long known for his bare-knuckled political tactics, said that key proposals on his group s websites were there without his knowledge, and assured HuffPost that he would operate within the confines of election law.In fact, after HuffPo confronted Stone with evidence that these kinds of tactics were being pursued by the website, he acknowledged that Vote Protectors had a  bad idea  and  ordered them taken down. Campaign Legal Center deputy director Danielle Lang called the tactics a clear voter intimidation scheme. It s inherently intimidating and an invasion of privacy,  she told HuffPo in reference to the videotaping.  When that s being live streamed to the internet, it amplifies the potentially intimidating aspect of it, and violates a sense of security and privacy people have a right to enjoy at the polls. Objectively, intimidating voters is unlawful, no matter where you do it. Indeed, but that s exactly what Donald Trump has been calling upon his supporters to do because he has repeatedly claimed that the election is rigged against him.As it turns out, he s right about the election being rigged, only it s conservatives who are trying to rig it in favor of Trump.Earlier this week, a Wisconsin city clerk in Green Bay got caught trying to intentionally prevent college students from voting by arguing in an email to the Wisconsin Ethics Commission that an extra polling place should not be opened near the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay because she has merely heard that students lean Democrat. I was reading the statutes and read: No site may be designated that affords an advantage to any political party,  Republican appointed clerk Kris Teske wrote. UWGB is a polling location for students and residents on Election Day but I feel by asking for this to be the site for early voting is encouraging the students to vote more than benefiting the city as a whole. I have heard it said that students lean more toward the democrats and he is a democrat. I have spoken with our Chief of Staff and others at City Hall and they agree that budget wise this isn t going to happen. I would like to know your thoughts on this. Do I have an argument about it being more of a benefit to the democrats. So not only are Trump supporters trying to rig the election with voter intimidation tactics using hypocritical methods, they are using voter suppression tactics as well.And that is likely going to cause a lot of Election Day chaos. Voters should be prepared to stand up for their right to vote no matter what Trump s deplorables try to do to keep them from exercising it.Featured Image: Drew Angerer/Getty Images ",Fake
" WATCH: Mike Pence Gets Embarrassing Grilling After He Evades Simple Question Donald Trump s Republican running mate Mike Pence, made an appearance on CNN s State of the Union Saturday morning where he was grilled by the show s host, Jake Tapper. The grilling was brought on by a line of questioning regarding Trump s flip-flop on his proposal to forcefully deport 11 million undocumented immigrants.The segment begins with Tapper playing a clip of Trump from last November where he clearly states that  We re going to have a deportation force,  that will seek out undocumented immigrants and deport them to their country of origin.Throughout his campaign, Trump has referred to the undocumented immigrants his force would target as criminals. It s a clever bit of political double speak that trump has used. It implies that he is only going after undocumented criminals. From Trump s supporters  viewpoints and his rhetoric, all undocumented immigrants are here illegally and are therefore criminals. Now that Trump is in general election mode, they need to come up with specifics. Trump cannot back away from his tough talk on immigration without burning his base. However, he also has to bring the scale of his proposals down since they are so radical they sound like they originated from a neo-Nazi s fever dream and thus alienate everyone whose hobbies don t include cutting eyeholes into white sheets.That s why during the interview Pence insists that Trump hasn t pivoted on the issue: Nothing has changed about Donald Trump s position on dealing with illegal immigration. His position and his principles have been absolutely consistent,  Pence said.  The choice could not be more clear for the American people. Donald Trump has been completely consistent in his positions. Tapper doesn t buy it. He responds to Pence saying: Except on this issue. The one issue you didn t really address is whether or not the 11 or 12 million undocumented immigrants will be removed by a deportation force as you heard Mr. Trump say in that clip from November of last year. Let  be clear: Trump has been slowly pivoting on immigration since the general election began. First, he wanted to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. Now, he wants to ban people who come from what he views as terrorist nations. He is doing the same thing with his proposal to create a mass deportation force. He has to. Setting aside the fact that it would create one of the largest human rights crises in the world, it would also cost the U.S. around $600 billion dollars. It would also have a side effect of completely destroying the U.S. economy.You can watch the interview below.Featured image from video screen capture ",Fake
"Kellyanne Conway's husband says Trump tweets hurting legal case WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The husband of White House adviser Kellyanne Conway criticized President Donald Trumpâ€™s tweets about the administrationâ€™s temporary travel ban on Monday, saying they were undercutting the Justice Departmentâ€™s ability to defend his policies. The presidentâ€™s messages â€œmay make some people feel better,â€ but they will not help the administration achieve its goal of getting the Supreme Court to rule in its favor, George Conway said in a Twitter message.  George Conway is a lawyer who last week withdrew from contention for a senior Justice Department post; his wife was Trumpâ€™s 2016 campaign manager before joining him in the White House as a senior adviser who is one of Trumpâ€™s most vigorous defenders. In later Twitter messages, George Conway emphasized he still â€œvery, very stronglyâ€ supports Trump and his executive order, but he said tweets on legal matters â€œseriously undermineâ€ the administrationâ€™s agenda. He also said that â€œsensibleâ€ lawyers in the White House and Justice Department agree with him.   In his early morning Twitter messages on Monday, Trump potentially hurt his administrationâ€™s legal case as it seeks to have the Supreme Court overturn lower courtsâ€™ rulings and allow the travel ban to go into effect. He assailed the Justice Department for a revised version of the measure that he called â€œwatered downâ€ and â€œpolitically correct.â€   The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about George Conwayâ€™s tweets.  The travel ban, which Trump says is aimed at preventing attacks in the United States, seeks to halt entry to the United States for 90 days for people from several predominantly Muslim countries and bar refugees for four months. Critics say it is discriminatory.   Conway was in contention to head the civil division of the Justice Department, which would have given him responsibility for defending the travel ban in court. He said last week that it was â€œnot the right timeâ€ for him to leave the private sector. ",Real

" The White House Just Tried To Pretend Trump Was WINNING, IMMEDIATELY Regrets It (DETAILS) Earlier today, Donald Trump whined about being held to a  ridiculous standard  in his first 100 days as POTUS, despite spending two years bragging about all the things he would get done in his first 100 days. By now most of us know that Trump has hardly accomplished anything during his first several weeks in the White House, and there have been far more failures than successes.Now, the White House is joining in on the mounting pressure for Trump to actually do something before his first 100 days come to an end. The Trump administration is now bending over backwards to make it seem as if Trump s presidency isn t the massive failure we all know it is   and of course they had to lie to make that possible.The White House has just claimed that Congress is going to vote on healthcare and tax reform next week, and that the government will be open despite the fact that the Republicans don t have any votes lined up and Congress will only be in session for half the week. According to CNBC: The White House hopes language on a possible health-care deal can come as early as Friday or Saturday, leaving the potential for an agreement next week, a White House official told CNBC. The Senate Budget Committee is assisting with the draft, which would be introduced first in the House. This is absolutely insane, and clearly a response to the fact that Trump hasn t accomplished anything in his first 100 days and the Trump administration is desperate to have something to show for it. In just 4 days, Trump expects the House to vote on health care, examine Trump s tax plan, and keep the government open just so he can have at least one win. That s not going to happen, and the American people know it. Here s the overwhelmingly negative response to Trump and his  accomplishments :      Featured image via Pool / Getty Images",Fake

" Trump Abuses Power, Punishes Qatar For Refusing To Give $500 Million Loan To Son-In-Law Kushner It turns out that Donald Trump was abusing his power when he accused Qatar of supporting terrorism and allowed sanctions against them.Jared Kushner did not gain his position by getting confirmed by the Senate. He got his cushy White House job because he is married to Trump s daughter Ivanka.And he has been using his position in an effort to do business, and is using Trump s power as president to retaliate against those who refuse to do business with him.Just before Trump went on a tirade against Qatar, Kushner tried to get a loan from one of the richest men in the small country, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani.Kushner asked for a $500 million loan from al-Thani because he needs to come up with $1.3 billion in the next two years before the interest-only mortgage is due on his family s 666 Fifth Avenue building in Manhattan. The only stipulation to getting the loan was that Kushner had to come up with some co-funding for the project. Of course, Kushner failed to live up to his end of the deal, so al-Thani wisely walked away rather than risk that much money on someone who makes promises he can t keep.And because al-Thani rejected Kushner s request, Donald Trump retaliated against Qatar by accusing the Gulf nation of being too close to Iran and gave Saudi Arabia the green light to cut diplomatic ties with Qatar and block transports there. Saudi Arabia is home to some Trump businesses, and Trump has been sucking up to the Saudi government, so of course, Saudi Arabia would gladly help Trump punish Qatar for refusing to give his family money.During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar   look!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 6, 2017Trump would repeat his claims against Qatar at the White House Rose Garden.It turns out that Russian hackers were responsible for making up statements by Qatari officials to make it look like they support Iran. But Trump refuses to stop punishing Qatar just because they refused to give money to Jared Kushner.This is what abuse of power looks like. Trump and Kushner are using the White House to punish nations who refuse to do business with them. That is grounds for impeachment right there. This is exactly why Trump should have been forced to cut all ties with his businesses, and why anyone who works in the White House should do the same to avoid these kinds of conflicts of interest.Clearly, Trump and his family are using the presidency as a way to enrich themselves.Featured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",Fake
"Russian envoy overheard saying he discussed campaign with Sessions: Post WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russiaâ€™s ambassador to Washington was overheard by U.S. spy agencies telling his bosses that he had discussed campaign-related matters, including issues important to Moscow, with Jeff Sessions during the 2016 presidential race, the Washington Post reported on Friday, citing current and former U.S. officials. A U.S. official confirmed to Reuters that Ambassador Sergei Kislyakâ€™s accounts of two conversations with Sessions, then a U.S. senator and key foreign policy adviser to Republican candidate Donald Trump, were intercepted by U.S. intelligence agencies. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there was nothing automatically inappropriate about Sessions, then a U.S. senator as well as a Trump supporter, discussing policy matters or even Trumpâ€™s thinking about them with a foreign diplomat. â€œThe question is whether he crossed the line and discussed classified information or talked about deals like lifting sanctions if the Russians were interested in investing in the U.S. or had dirt on Secretary Clinton,â€ said a second official familiar with the intercepts, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity. â€œHis memory is another matter.â€ Sessions at first failed to disclose his contacts with Kislyak and then said the meetings were not about the Trump campaign.  As Attorney General, he recused himself in March from matters connected to an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and any connections to the Trump campaign following his admission that he had talked to the Russian envoy. Sessions has denied discussing campaign issues with Russian officials and has said that he only met Kislyak in his role of U.S. senator. The Post cited one U.S. official as saying that Sessions  provided â€œmisleadingâ€ statements that are â€œcontradicted by other evidence.â€  The newspaper reported that a former official said that the intelligence indicates that Sessions and Kislyak had â€œsubstantiveâ€ discussions on matters including Trumpâ€™s positions on Russia-related issues and prospects for U.S.-Russia relations in a Trump administration. The Washington Post cited a Justice Department spokeswoman, Sarah Isgur Flores, as saying: â€œObviously I cannot comment on the reliability of what anonymous sources describe in a wholly uncorroborated intelligence intercept that the Washington Post has not seen and that has not been provided to me.â€  The Post said that Sessions did not discuss interference in the election. Trump said in a New York Times interview on Wednesday that he was disappointed by Sessionsâ€™ move to recuse himself, but a White House spokeswoman said on Thursday that the president still had confidence in Sessions â€œor he would not be the attorney general.â€ ",Real
"U.S. plans to admit maximum 45,000 refugees in next fiscal year WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration plans to admit up to 45,000 refugees to the United States in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1, a former U.S. official said on Tuesday, a ceiling that would keep admissions to their lowest level in over a decade. The White House settled on the figure after a contentious debate between officials who wanted a lower ceiling and those who wanted a higher one, said the former official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. On one side of the debate were officials who tended to look at the issue through a domestic political prism given President Donald Trumpâ€™s focus on curbing immigration during the 2016 U.S.  presidential campaign.  On the other were foreign policy experts who argued that taking refugees into the United States is vital to ensure other nations keep their borders open. The plan to set the cap at 45,000 was earlier reported by the Wall Street Journal newspaper. The former official, who favored a higher number, said the decision will undermine the U.S. ability to persuade nations such as Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon that have accepted huge flows of Syrian refugees to keep admitting them as well as to convince donor nations to keep up financial contributions for refugees. â€œWe have no standing to play that role when we cut our own humanitarian assistance and when we are halving our refugee admissions,â€ said the former official. In his two travel ban executive orders, Trump directed the United States to accept a maximum of 50,000 refugees for permanent resettlement in the fiscal 2017 year ending Sept. 30, less than half the 110,000 President Barack Obama authorized. In part because of court challenges to those orders, the United States ultimately accepted more than 50,000 refugees during the current fiscal year. According to State Department data, the United States took in 51,392 refugees through August. If the United States accepts 45,000 in fiscal 2018, it would be the lowest level admitted since fiscal 2006, when it took in 41,223, according to State Department data. A State Department spokesman declined comment on the 45,000 figure, saying only that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke would consult Congress on Wednesday. â€œEach year, the president makes an annual determination, after appropriate consultation with Congress, regarding the refugee admissions ceiling for the following Fiscal Year. Secretary Tillerson and DHS Acting Secretary Duke will consult with Congress tomorrow,â€ he said.",Real
"INSTANTVIEW: House Republicans pass revised Obamacare overhaul (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives approved a bill on Thursday to repeal major parts of Obamacare and replace it with a Republican healthcare plan, handing President Donald Trump his biggest legislative victory but setting up a tough fight in the Senate. STEPHEN WOOD, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, RUSSELL INVESTMENTS, NEW YORK: â€œThis strikes to me that the market is breathing a sigh of relief more than a nod of approval. I think there will be progress on individual and corporate tax cuts but they will come at the end of 2017. This will be positive for the economy and markets. We think there will be â€˜knots in the flossâ€™ to get legislation done. We expect to see more sloppiness in the legislative process so you have to focus on fundamentals. Valuation is currently very high in the equity space. The outlook for the United States is good, but we need very good fundamentals to justify current equity valuation. Europe is increasingly interesting from an equity perspective. One would be more comfortable with Europe compared with the U.S.â€ â€œElections have consequences, and I think that this is the very first manifestation of it. It would be foolish to say that it doesnâ€™t reinvigorate Trump because ... earlier this week the main headlines were that the budget was an Obama-type budget instead of anything that was promised during the campaign. â€œOnce Republicans develop cohesion you are going to see more of a domino effect. Itâ€™s like, â€˜We all got onboard with this (healthcare reform), whatâ€™s stopping us from trying to get money for the wall or having tax reform thatâ€™s going to be agreeable to the presidentâ€™s agenda?â€™ So I think that it does in some way invigorate it.â€  GUY LEBAS, CHIEF FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST, JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT, PHILADELPHIA: â€œWhat is a bit lost in the perception that Houseâ€™s healthcare reform bill is positive for financial markets is a proposed repeal of a surcharge of roughly 3.9 percent on investment income on high-income individuals, which is in the Affordable Care Act. Now this bill goes to the Senate. For the market, the odds of passage of at least this version of â€˜repeal-and-replaceâ€™ in the Senate isnâ€™t very high. Itâ€™s going to a tough sell in the Senate. This is largely a non-event for the bond market. Itâ€™s more gearing up for tomorrowâ€™s jobs report and what Yellen might say.â€ RANDY FREDERICK, VICE PRESIDENT, TRADING AND DERIVATIVES, CHARLES SCHWAB, AUSTIN, TEXAS: â€œI think anything that they (Republicans) get done, that they accomplish, popular or unpopular, will show that they have the ability to make progress and to get things done and work together. Because obviously the biggest divisions are not between the Democrats and the Republicans but within the Republican party. â€œThis puts the idea of tax reform a little bit closer to reality, simply because itâ€™s shown that they have figured out a way to negotiate and work together.â€ JOSEPH KRIST, PARTNER, CREDIT SPECIALIST, COURT STREET GROUP RESEARCH, NEW YORK: Â Â Â  â€œIt means that it satisfies those members of Congress who have made this a primary campaign issue and want to say they want to repeal Obamacare and we voted to did it. From a policy standpoint it is virtually meaningless. The bill from everything I have seen is virtually impossible to pass in the Senate.â€ Â Â Â  â€œI donâ€™t think this really should have any impact. The fundamentals driving peopleâ€™s healthcare ideas came before the election. People looking at small standalone and rural hospitals, saw they were wall badly positioned for healthcare reform going forward, whether it be because of Obamacare, should it remain, due to cost reduction measures. And conversely people were looking at size as a really important factor, whether a large institution or large chains. The consolidation was already coming whether repealed or not. It is not really a big factor from a public finance fixed income perspective. You still want big balance sheets, large pools of cash and diversity revenues.â€  â€œThis morning going in the market was expecting the House was going to pass it and it did.â€ â€œThis is just one of several different things Trump is trying to get accomplished. This is out of the way and now they have to go to tax reform. Thatâ€™s something thatâ€™s going to drag out for a while and probably the next key thing, aside from the geopolitical things that are going on.â€  Â Â Â Â â€œAs far as traders and investors I talk to, this (healthcare bill) isnâ€™t affecting their position or what they want to do.â€  RICK MECKLER, PRESIDENT, LIBERTYVIEW CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, JERSEY CITY, NEW JERSEY: â€œThe fact that they could pass this doesnâ€™t make much of a difference. The real risk in the near term to the so-called Trump rally was a failure to pass it. â€œI donâ€™t know if this market is really that focused on healthcare as the big issue. I think theyâ€™re really focused on the tax plan. If they couldnâ€™t pass the healthcare, it would bode very poorly for the tax plan.  â€œBut the fact that they could pass the healthcare, even pass it in the House, and pass it so narrowly, I donâ€™t think it necessarily means the tax plan is more likely to come through.â€ KEN POLCARI, DIRECTOR OF THE NYSE FLOOR DIVISION, Oâ€™NEIL SECURITIES, NEW YORK: â€œIt passes the House, thatâ€™s fine, now it goes to the Senate, and we know in the Senate it is going to have a very tough time. So even though it has passed the one, it is certainly not a done deal yet. Obamacare is still very much alive and intact.  â€œThe market has really been flat. I donâ€™t necessarily think this is such a surprise, after all the news reports today and yesterday, people were expecting it. They are all high-fiving and cheering and all that stuff in the Congress but it still has to go to the Senate and that is where it is going to run into some problems.  â€œThe market is again biding time, there is no reason itâ€™s not really taking off, we are hitting our head at the ceiling, we have been hitting our head on the ceiling. If anything it is going to cause it, the catalyst is going to be the (French election) Sunday night. It is listless trading at the moment, nobody is making big huge bets one way or the other.â€ STOCKS: S&P 500 remains little changed on the day BONDS: 2- and 10-year Treasury yields hold higher on the day FOREX: The dollar index ticks down to the session low ",Real

"Senior Republican proposes more oversight of foreign lobbying WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley, head of the Senate Judiciary Committee, proposed a bill on Tuesday to overhaul disclosure rules regarding anyone working on behalf of a foreign government, a law that has received renewed attention after Paul Manafort was indicted for violating it.  The proposed legislation, called the Disclosing Foreign Influence Act, would close loopholes in the Foreign Agents Registration Act and require the Department of Justice to develop a strategy for enforcing the law, the Republican senator said in a statement.  Manafort, a longtime Republican operative who briefly served as Donald Trumpâ€™s campaign manager in 2016, and his business associate Rick Gates, pleaded not guilty on Monday to a 12-count indictment that contained charges ranging from money laundering to acting as unregistered agents of Ukraineâ€™s former pro-Russian government. The current law, known as FARA, requires persons acting on behalf of a foreign government or political party to disclose to the Department of Justice their work as well as public communications taken on behalf of that client.  Critics have argued the reporting requirements for FARA are unclear and contains loopholes that allow American lobbyists to avoid disclosure of their foreign clients. â€œCongress passed the Foreign Agents Registration Act to prevent inappropriate influence in domestic policy, but my oversight work has uncovered rampant disregard by foreign agents and lackluster enforcement by federal authorities,â€ Grassley said in a statement.   The proposed law would clarify who is required to register, improve investigative tools, including granting authority for the Justice Department to pursue civil charges, and create new reporting requirements. FARA was first passed in 1938 in the lead up to World War II in an effort to combat German propaganda efforts and was later amended in 1966 to include lobbyists, according to the Department of Justice. As the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Grassley is empowered to see that the bill quickly receives a hearing and a vote. ",Real
"U.S. senator on Equifax hack: 'Somebody needs to go to jail' WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Thirty-six U.S. senators on Tuesday called on federal authorities to investigate the sale of nearly $2 million in shares of credit bureau Equifax Inc by company executives after a massive data breach, and one compared their actions to insider trading. The lawmakers signed a letter asking the U.S. Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission to look into about $1.8 million in stock sales by three executives between July 29 - the day Equifax said it learned that its systems were hacked in mid-May - and when they made it public last week. â€œIf that happened, somebody needs to go to jail,â€ Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, said at a credit union industry conference in Washington. â€œItâ€™s a problem when people can act with impunity with no consequences. How is that not insider trading?â€ Cyber security experts believe the breach is one of the largest data hacks ever disclosed. On Wall Street on Tuesday, Equifax closed 2.5 percent higher at $115.96, slightly reversing a 21 percent slide since the hack was reported. In an opinion piece in USA Today, Equifax Chief Executive Officer Richard Smith apologized for the breach and vowed the company â€œwill make changes.â€ He said more than 15 million people have visited the firmâ€™s support website and 11.5 million are enrolling in credit monitoring and identity theft protection. The company at first thought the intrusion was limited, Smith said. Equifax hired a cybersecurity firm and spent â€œthousands of hoursâ€ investigating before informing the public six weeks after the breach was discovered, he said. â€œWe are devoting extraordinary resources to make sure this kind of incident doesnâ€™t happen again,â€ Smith said. Smith did not address the stock sale issue. In their letter, the lawmakers, led by Jack Reed, a Democrat, and John Kennedy, a Republican, requested â€œa thorough examination of any unusual trading, including any atypical options trading, for violations of insider trading law.â€ â€œWe request that you spare no effort in your investigations and in enforcing the law to the fullest extent,â€ the lawmakers said. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has already said it was investigating the Equifax hack. A spokesman for SEC Chairman Jay Clayton declined to comment. Acting FTC head Maureen Ohlhausen declined to say if that agency was investigating the breach. â€œWeâ€™re trying to get a handle on the scope of all of this. Weâ€™re certainly taking this very seriously,â€ she told reporters at an antitrust conference. The agency has historically probed big breaches but only sued companies that had been sloppy in protecting consumer data. The breach also prompted expressions of concern from U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, while the Massachusetts attorney general said her state planned to sue.  Hackers pilfered names, birthdays and addresses, as well as Social Security and driverâ€™s license numbers - a treasure trove for identity thieves. Data of up to 143 million people may have been exposed. Following revelations of the stock sales by Chief Financial Officer John Gamble and two other people, Equifax said in a statement last week that the executives were not aware that an intrusion had occurred when they sold their shares. Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said she intended to sue Equifax with allegations of failing to maintain appropriate safeguards to protect customersâ€™ data, including that of nearly three million Massachusetts residents. â€œIn all of our years investigating data breaches, this may be the most brazen failure to protect consumer data we have ever seen,â€ Healey said in a statement. Equifax had initially appeared to offer credit monitoring to breach victims only if they forfeited their right to file a lawsuit. New York Attorney General A.G. Schneiderman said Tuesday that Equifax removed that language from its website. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin on Tuesday called the Equifax breach â€œquite unfortunateâ€ and insisted that his top priority is to make sure financial data is safe. â€œI am concerned about the global financial system and keeping it safe,â€ he said at the CNBC Institutional Investor Delivering Alpha Conference in New York. Equifax did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. ",Real
" Two GOP Reps. Have An Alternate Healthcare Bill, And Its Name Will Make You Laugh Your A** Off House Republicans (finally) unveiled their repeal-and-replace healthcare plan, much to the fury of all the people who will be hurt by the GOP s insistence on giving massive blow jobs to their corporate overlords. Some Republicans aren t behind it, but many are. And then there are some that have drafted their own bill, like Rep. Pete Sessions of Texas (not to be confused with embattled Attorney General, Jeff Sessions).He introduced his own healthcare legislation on March 1st, and he calls it the  World s Greatest Healthcare Plan of 2017.  Seriously. That s the actual name of the bill. This isn t from The Onion, or something that Snopes or Politifact are going to rate as false. Pete Sessions literally named it the  World s Greatest Healthcare Plan of 2017. While that sounds egotistical enough to be the same bill that the House unveiled earlier this week, it s not. Sessions also never meant it to compete with the AHCA, which is the Republicans  current plan with which to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Pete Sessions does support that bill and hopes it passes.His own bill, the  World s Greatest Healthcare Plan of 2017,  has similar provisions to the AHCA, because of course it does. It would eliminate the individual and employer mandates, expand health savings accounts (which he apparently thinks promotes accountability), turns the premium subsidies into tax credits that are absolute baloney, and so forth.So it s another version of Obamacare Lite, which Republicans like Rand Paul despise because the AHCA is not the full repeal that they promised the American people (but a full, clean repeal like Paul wants is impossible now).But that name   the one Sessions put on his own. Really? That s seriously something that Donald Trump would do. Despite the name, Sessions  spokesperson says he really believes in the GOP s plan, and believes that both are the greatest healthcare bills. His just has a more ridiculous name, and it s not the first time he s introduced it. He actually introduced  The World s Greatest Healthcare Plan of 2016  last year.Perhaps his next bill will be one to amend the AHCA to be called the  World s Greatest Healthcare Plan of 2018?

"Senate confirms Trump's pick for Homeland Security secretary WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Tuesday confirmed President Donald Trumpâ€™s choice to lead the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), a post that opened after John Kelly became Trumpâ€™s chief of staff earlier this year. Senators voted 62-37 to confirm Kirstjen Nielsen, formerly Kellyâ€™s deputy in the White House and his chief of staff when he led DHS. She is considered a cyber security expert and previously served in the administration of Republican President George W. Bush. Nielsen, 45, will take the reins of a department with more than 240,000 employees responsible for immigration enforcement, U.S. border and airport security, disaster response, and protecting U.S. infrastructure from cyber attacks. The agency is at the center of Trumpâ€™s efforts to enact broad changes to the U.S. immigration system. Elaine Duke, a civil servant and the DHS deputy secretary, had been serving as acting secretary since Kellyâ€™s departure for the White House in July.  In the last five months she ha been responsible for several controversial DHS decisions, including the end of temporary protected status for thousands of immigrants living in the United States. And the Federal Emergency Management Agency, a DHS entity, came under criticism for its response to the humanitarian disaster wrought by Hurricane Maria when it struck Puerto Rico in September. In a statement, Duke said she looked forward to working as Nielsenâ€™s deputy, and said Nielsen has â€œa deep understanding of the issues facing the Department.â€ Eleven Democrats voted with nearly all Republicans to confirm Nielsen. Republican Senator Lamar Alexander did not vote, and no Republicans voted against her confirmation.

The rule hadn t gone into effect, but it would have given us more control over what our ISPs can do with our information than we currently have.The GOP doesn t want that rule to go into effect, and Max Temkin, one of the founders of the party game  Cards Against Humanity,  has made a vow that Congress would be wise to heed, since Temkin has an awful lot of money:If this shit passes I will buy the browser history of every congressman and congressional aide and publish it. cc @SpeakerRyan https://t.co/cOL3mx6JuG  Max Temkin (@MaxTemkin) March 27, 2017It s a strong,  in your face, how do you like it?  move. The point that Temkin is trying to make here is that, if Congressional Republicans are willing to allow companies to buy and sell our information, compromising our privacy, then they should know exactly what that feels like. The ISPs and the GOP both feel that this restriction was unfair, given that it wouldn t have applied to major websites like Google and Facebook.So, of course, we should get rid of this rule instead of leveling the playing field and preventing Google and Facebook (and other sites) from likewise collecting and selling our data. Industry groups framed their argument like so: It set out an overbroad definition of sensitive data that doesn t apply to non-ISP s collecting as much or more personal data online. And as we all know, privacy shouldn t be about who collects information, it should be about what information is collected and how it is used. The truth is that Republicans have been getting a lot of money from the telecom industry, and they only care about privacy when it doesn t adversely affect their handlers. Maybe if they re the first to have their data sold and exposed, they ll think twice about their selective brand of privacy advocacy.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",Fake
"Massachusetts governor proposes bill to stiffen immigration enforcement BOSTON (Reuters) - Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker proposed a bill on Tuesday to allow police and courts to hold people facing deportation orders in custody for extra time to allow them to be turned over to federal immigration officials. The move by the Republican came a week after the stateâ€™s top court ruled that law enforcement does not have the legal authority to comply with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainer requests. The ICE requests ask that people facing civil deportation orders be held in custody for up to 48 hours after the cases that brought them into the court system are determined. Baker said the courtâ€™s decision overturned longstanding policy in the state. â€œFor years, many local police departments and the trial court have cooperated with ICE to ensure that they can detain violent and dangerous criminals, convicted of crimes like murder and rape, to keep our communities safe,â€ Baker said in a statement. â€œThis bill allows the state police to honor specific detainers.â€ Bakerâ€™s proposal would limit compliance to cases where the person ICE officials want detained is suspected of violent crimes such as terrorism, street-gang activity or human trafficking, or has been convicted of a felony not directly related to his or her immigration status. ICE detainer requests apply to immigrants in the country illegally who are arrested or otherwise enter the criminal justice system. Bakerâ€™s proposal would require a judgeâ€™s approval to hold people facing a detainer request for longer than 12 hours after their cases are resolved. President Donald Trump has made cracking down on illegal immigration a top priority of his administration. The state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union criticized the move. â€œBakerâ€™s proposed legislation ... is constitutionally suspect because it attempts to authorize state and local law enforcement to detain people without due process,â€ the groupâ€™s executive director, Carol Rose, said in a statement. The leaders of the Democratic-controlled state legislature in Massachusetts did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Bakerâ€™s proposal. ",Real
" CNN Host STUNNED After Trump Advisor Denies Evidence Of Assault Allegations (VIDEO) Donald Trump s wife Melania, who became infamous for copying First Lady Michelle Obama s speech word for word at the Republican National Convention, recently gave yet another memorable speech this week. This time, she s being mocked for giving a truly delusional and ironic speech in which she denounced cyberbullying   a bullying tactic that her husband is practically an expert on.On Thursday, Trump deputy campaign manager David Bossie got called out by CNN s Jake Tapper over Melania s anti-cyberbullying comments, which eventually turned into an insane conversation about Trump s sexual assault allegations. Tapper pointed out how aggressive Trump is over the internet when he said: I don t know any major public figure in America who launches more personal negative attacks against people via social media than Donald Trump. If it s not okay for kids to do it, why is it okay for Donald Trump to do it? Bossie defended his boss, and gave a truly idiotic defense to insist that Trump doesn t cyberbully: Mr. Trump takes on his opponents and takes on the liberal media, that s not cyberbullying. Cyberbullying is mostly people hiding behind things. Mr. Trump takes on those who take him on. The interview got even more insane when Tapper grilled Bossie on Trump s misogyny and rape accusations, pointing out that a dozen women have now come forward to accuse Trump of sexually assaulting them. Bossie completely denied facts, leaving Tapper stunned. As Bossie tried to argue that there was no evidence that those numerous allegations were true, Tapper fired back with several facts about what Trump has been accused of over the last several weeks   which made Bossie look like an absolute idiot. The last few seconds of this interview are nothing but pure discomfort for Bossie, and it is awesome!You can watch Tapper handle the stupidity of the Trump campaign below:Featured image via video screen capture",Fake
"As Texans' claims pour in, Congress mulls flood insurance program's future WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Krassi Nikov evacuated his Houston home with more than 2 feet (61 cm) of water inside of it on Tuesday after Tropical Storm Harvey devastated Texasâ€™ Gulf Coast. He now plans to collect on his flood insurance for the second time this year and rebuild. But the future of the federal government-run flood insurance program on which Nikov, 63, and other property owners in vulnerable areas depend rests with the U.S. Congress. Congress will soon be asked to renew the National Flood Insurance Program, which expires at the end of September. While a simple extension of the program has wide bipartisan support, some lawmakers are calling for broad reform. The program had received 35,000 claims from Texas by midday on Wednesday, according to Roy Wright, its administrator, who described it as a â€œvery fastâ€ pace. Wright said he was confident Congress would reauthorize the program, but he added that the program would only be prevented from selling new policies or renewing existing ones if it were to lapse.  â€œIt does not affect ability to accept claims,â€ Wright said. Republicans advocating changes to the program want private companies to write the policies, which they say would result in premium prices that more accurately reflect risks. Additionally, they want the U.S. government to stop charging the program interest, with the savings to be used for flood mitigation.Â  That could set up a difficult battle. Conservatives have voiced concerns that the insurance program has about $25 billion of debt, while Democrats say the Republicansâ€™ plan to allow private-market plans would be more expensive for homeowners.  A bipartisan group of lawmakers from coastal states  including Senators Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, have been pushing for changes to the program. The NFIP has been reauthorized 17 times since it was created in 1968, with the last time occurring in 2012. It has been allowed to lapse just four times. Many lobbyists believe Congress is unlikely to attempt a sweeping reform of the program before the end of September, given a busy legislative schedule that includes approving funding to avoid a government shutdown and raising the debt ceiling. Congress also faces pressure to pass an aid package to help the devastated Gulf Coast. Goldman Sachs said in a research note on Tuesday that early estimates suggested Harvey would cost â€œin the range of $30 billion.â€   Instead, most observers expect Congress to pass a short-term extension of the program, ranging from three months to a year. Leaders in Congress are weighing whether to attach it to another piece of legislation such as a continuing resolution to fund the government, according to several lobbyists following the issue. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryanâ€™s office said it was confident the program would be reauthorized.     U.S. Representative Jeb Hensarling, a Republican who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, said in a Bloomberg television interview on Monday that he hoped his package of reforms could gain full approval before the end of next month. Hensarling wants to renew the program for five years if private insurers are allowed to write the flood policies. But a business lobbyist who consults for many large American companies and follows the issue closely said Hensarling lacked the support to get his package passed by the House when Congress left for its August recess.  â€œI donâ€™t think theyâ€™re at the point now where they have the votes,â€ the lobbyist said. He added that trying to overhaul the program would be a distraction for federal emergency officials and the flood insurance program.   â€œEven if there was a package of reforms ready to go, (the agencies) are not going to have the bandwidth to deal with some kind of reform package,â€ he said.  In a letter to Ryan and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi sent on Monday, 100 House Democrats expressed concerns about the Hensarling package, saying they would not vote for the full package despite believing flood insurance reauthorization was crucial.  â€œMost of these bills do not meet the goals of affordability, availability, increased mitigation efforts or improved mapping,â€ the letter said.   Jerry Howard, head of the National Home Builders Association, said the group had endorsed Hensarlingâ€™s package and was hopeful the bills would pass quickly.  Emily Naden of the Building Owners and Managers Association, which in Houston alone represents owners and managers of 312 million square feet of office space and accounts for 43,000 jobs, said the organization had been pushing for reforms but must prioritize avoiding a lapse in coverage. â€œFor us, we absolutely need the program to be re-upped without a lapse â€“ a lapse is incredibly detrimental to all of our policy members,â€ she said.

" The Pope Flat Out Called Fox News Type Journalism â€˜Terrorismâ€™ Someone had to say it. Okay, liberals have been saying it for years.

Channeling Franklin Delano Roosevelt s infamous line,  we have nothing to fear but fear itself,  the Pope chastised fear-based media.Journalism based on gossip or rumors is a form of  terrorism  and media that stereotype entire populations or foment fear of migrants are acting destructively, Pope Francis said on Thursday.Spreading rumors is an example of  terrorism, of how you can kill a person with your tongue , he said.  This is even more true for journalists because their voice can reach everyone and this is a very powerful weapon.

After all, Fox spreads little but fear and that s what has given us Donald Trump.Crime in the nation is down. An American s odds of being killed by a terrorist is 1 in 20 million. Those are roughly the same odds as being killed by your own furniture. Still, Trump, prompted on by Fox News, is scaring the crap out of Americans:Fear is in the air, and fear is surging. Americans are more afraid today than they have been in a long time: Polls show majorities of Americans worried about being victims of terrorism and crime, numbers that have surged over the past year to highs not seen for more than a decade. Every week seems to bring a new large- or small-scale terrorist attack, at home or abroad. Mass shootings form a constant drumbeat.

"Group sues Trump for repealing U.S. wildlife rule in rare legal challenge WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An environmental group sued President Donald Trumpâ€™s administration on Thursday over the repeal of a U.S. rule intended to protect wildlife, in the first court challenge to a law being used by Republicans to ease federal regulation. In February, the Republican-controlled Congress used the Congressional Review Act, or CRA, to dismantle a rule that the administration of former Democratic President Barack Obama finalized in August to limit hunting on federal lands in Alaska. The rule had exempted wolves and bears from Alaskaâ€™s plans to control predators, which included killing wolves and their pups in their dens and shooting bears from planes.  The CRA only requires simple majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate and the presidentâ€™s signature to wipe newly minted regulations off the books.   In the federal court lawsuit, which likely has little chance of success, the Center for Biological Diversity said the CRA violated the U.S. Constitution because it barred regulators in the future from enacting â€œsubstantially similarâ€ rules to the ones repealed.   â€œThe Congressional Review Act throws the balance of power out of whack and opens the door for politicians in Congress to meddle in decisions that ought to be made by experts at federal agencies,â€ said Collette Adkins, a biologist and attorney at the center. â€œBy law the Fish and Wildlife Service must protect biological diversity on Alaskan wildlife refuges. But the act makes it more difficult for agency officials to carry out their legal duty,â€ she said in a statement. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The CRA, drafted in 1996, has a structure and language that abide by what the U.S. Supreme Court said in the case INS v. Chadha, likely making it constitutional, said Karl Manheim, professor of law at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. Since Feb. 1, Trump has signed 13 congressional resolutions repealing rules on the environment, education, gun control, corruption and family planning. Most advocacy groups that had tried to block the resolutions said this week they were not intending to file similar suits.  â€œUnfortunately I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s an avenue for courts to overturn a CRA resolution,â€ said Alison Zieve who works in litigation for the liberal Public Citizen group.

"Mueller, New York attorney general cooperating on Manafort probe: Politico WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Special counsel Robert Muellerâ€™s team is working with New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman on its investigation into President Donald Trumpâ€™s former campaign manager Paul Manafort and his financial transactions, Politico reported on Wednesday. Citing unnamed people familiar with the matter, Politico reported Muellerâ€™s team, which is investigating possible collusion between Trumpâ€™s campaign and Russia, and Schneidermanâ€™s aides have shared evidence and talked frequently about a potential case in recent weeks. The cooperation â€œcould potentially provide Mueller with additional leverage to get Manafort to cooperate in the larger investigation into Trumpâ€™s campaign, as Trump does not have pardon power over state crimes,â€ Politico reported. CNN reported on Tuesday that Mueller had issued subpoenas to an attorney who formerly represented Manafort and to a Manafort spokesman. Manafortâ€™s Virginia apartment was raided by agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation last month. The longtime political consultant and lobbyist is being investigated for possible money laundering and has been targeted as someone who might testify against former colleagues, two people familiar with Muellerâ€™s work have said. Politico said no decision had been made on whether to file charges, and quoted one of the sources as saying â€œNothing is imminent.â€ Muellerâ€™s team has been looking into Manafortâ€™s lobbying work and financial transactions, including real estate deals in New York. Manafort, who headed Republican Trumpâ€™s campaign for several months in 2016, has not been accused of any wrongdoing. Schneiderman, a Democrat, said in May that Trumpâ€™s firing of former FBI Director James Comey threatened the integrity of the agency. Trump has called Schneiderman a â€œlightweight.â€ Russia has denied any meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. Trump has denied any collusion by his campaign and has condemned the investigation as political witch hunt. ",Real
"Hawaii renews bid to narrow Trump travel ban (Reuters) - The state of Hawaii renewed its bid to narrow President Donald Trumpâ€™s temporary travel ban, following court rulings which said the state had taken the wrong procedural approach in attempts to challenge the administrationâ€™s policy earlier this week. In a court filing late on Friday, Hawaiiâ€™s attorney general asked a Honolulu judge to issue an injunction allowing grandparents and other family members to travel to the United States. The U.S. Supreme Court last month let the ban on travel from six Muslim-majority countries go forward with a limited scope, saying it could not apply to anyone with a credible â€œbona fide relationshipâ€ with a U.S. person or entity. The Trump administration then decided that spouses, parents, children, fiancÃ©s and siblings would be exempt from the ban, while grandparents and other family members traveling from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen would be barred.  Trump said the measure was necessary to prevent attacks. However, opponents including states and refugee advocacy groups sued to stop it, disputing its security rationale and saying it discriminated against Muslims. Earlier this week Hawaii had asked a Honolulu judge for a court order clarifying the Supreme Courtâ€™s ruling to allow grandparents into the United States. The judge, along with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, ruled that the lower courts did not have the power to simply clarify the Supreme Courtâ€™s opinion. However, the 9th Circuit on Friday said the courts could issue an injunction against Trumpâ€™s policy in the future, if the government misapplied the Supreme Courtâ€™s ruling to a particular person or entity harmed by the travel ban. Hours after that ruling, Hawaii made such an injunction request in a Honolulu federal court. Hawaii said the state itself, along with resettlement agencies, are harmed by Trumpâ€™s guidelines because they are prevented from helping refugees move there. A Justice Department spokeswoman could not immediately be reached for comment.  The roll-out of the narrowed version of the ban was more subdued last week than in January when Trump first signed a more expansive version of the order. That sparked protests and chaos at airports around the country and the world. ",Real
" WATCH: Fox Anchor Chris Wallace Rips NRA Stooge A New One For Lying About Gun Control Chris Wallace tore this prick apart.It s only been a week since a gunman shot and killed 58 people and wounded nearly 500 in Las Vegas with a fully automatic assault weapon.On Sunday, National Rifle Association executive director Chris Cox appeared on Fox News Sunday and began by appearing to suggest that the NRA is only calling for regulating bump stocks because NRA members were shot at the concert. You know, because non-NRA members apparently don t matter.Anyway, Cox went on to once again say that we should not be discussing gun control after this latest mass shooting and that we should wait in the name of  common decency. Host Chris Wallace had a problem with that. You say common decency, let s wait, what s enough time?  Wallace asked.  I mean, here were 58 people killed, almost 500 injured. Is it common decency to wait a day, two days, a week, a month. I mean, it is understandable   I know you don t agree with their solution but what s wrong with saying we need to address this? Of course, rather than answer the question, Cox turned the discussion into an attack on Hillary Clinton and other Democrats, all while whining about them have armed guards. Is that a sensible way to have this conversation, to try to turn it into class warfare, where if you re for gun control somehow you re part of an elite?  Wallace responded.Indeed, after the numerous death threats directed at her during the 2016 campaign, including one by Trump in which he called for  Second Amendment people  to do something if she had won, it s understandable why Hillary Clinton would want security. It s not class warfare,  Cox replied.  It s what the American people want. And that s when Wallace buried him. That s not actually true. If you talk about background checks, if you talk about automatic weapons   there are a lot of people, in fact a majority of people according to the polls who would like to see those gun controls. I have to say that I m put off at the argument, if you believe in gun control, you re an elite. I have to tell you, Mr. Cox, I know very few people  who have armed body guards. One of the few people I know who has armed body guards is Wayne LaPierre. We can argue about the merits of it. But I think to dismiss people and say,  Well, that s just the elite and they have armed guards,  it seems to me does a disservice to your argument. Here s the video via YouTube.A CBS poll last year found that 57 percent of Americans support an assault weapons ban.And polls consistently show that 80 percent to 90 percent of Americans, including 74 percent of NRA members, want background checks for all gun sales.So, Cox was clearly lying and Wallace rightfully called him out for it.Featured Image: Screenshot",Fake
"Trump officials to unveil plan to cut factory rules this week WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration intends to unveil this week a plan to trim regulations it believes constrain U.S. manufacturing growth, potentially affecting environmental permits, worker safety and labor rules, an administration official said. The U.S. Commerce Departmentâ€™s regulations â€œhit listâ€ recommendations follow more than three months of study and consultation with industry on ways to streamline regulations and ease burdens on manufacturing firms.  A Trump administration official with knowledge of the recommendations to be sent to the White House said the Environmental Protection Agencyâ€™s complex permitting rules will be a key focus, echoing comments to Reuters by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross last month. The 171 public comments submitted by companies and industry groups offer a strong hint to priorities for Commerceâ€™s streamlining efforts, with numerous industry groups and firms complaining that EPA air quality permit rules for new facilities are often redundant. The report will analyze the submissions and â€œwill identify a lot of problems and lay out ways to take responsible actions,â€ said the official, who declined to be identified by name. The process has looked at many regulations finalized under Trumpâ€™s predecessor, President Barack Obama. A common demand from industry was that the Trump administration should reject a planned tightening of ozone rules under the U.S. Clean Air Actâ€™s National Ambient Air Quality Standards, with several groups arguing this would expose them to increased permitting hurdles for new facilities, raising costs. 3M Co (MMM.N) said other permitting requirements under the Clean Air Act contained â€œoverlapping rules, redundant requirements, conflicts between rules and undue complexity.â€ The National Association of Manufacturers said the EPAâ€™s review requirements for new sources of emissions such as factories can add $100,000 in costs for modeling air quality to a new facility and delay factory expansions by 18 months. It added that EPA should find ways to ease burdens for smaller projects and smaller firms. Also drawing complaints from construction groups and iron foundries is an incoming Occupational Safety and Health Administration rule reducing by 80 percent the amount of crystalline silica dust that can be inhaled. The dust, common on construction sites, can cause lung cancer, according to OSHA, but industry groups say reducing it to those levels will be prohibitively expensive. â€œTo meet these much lower levels, new engineering controls and other measures will become necessary within the roofing industry,â€ said the National Roofing Contractors Association. Trump has already taken steps to roll back some not fully completed Obama-era environmental regulations such as restrictions on coal-fired power plants and a clean water rule greatly restricting runoff into small streams. But the Commerce list may target some rules already on the books.    â€œWe are at the outset of what we think will be a very intense deregulatory agenda from the Trump team,â€ said Amit Narang, regulatory policy advocate at Public Citizen, a consumer watchdog group. â€œWe are concerned that they are looking to gut regulations that benefit workers and benefit consumers.â€ Another OSHA rule that drew industry complaints is one that further reduces worker exposure to beryllium, another potential carcinogen, that became effective on May 20 after a decade-long rulemaking effort. Manufacturing groups including auto parts makers have also targeted labor rules that make it easier for unions to organize workers, expand the number of employees eligible for overtime and govern the reporting of workplace injuries. The range of industry complaints is vast. Mining giant Freeport-McMoRan (FCX.N) argued that planned EPA financial responsibility requirements for hard rock mining operations costing billions of dollars were based on inadequate study and â€œwill have disastrous consequences for the mining industry.â€ Guitar maker Taylor Guitars said that permits needed from the Fish and Wildlife Service for mother-of-pearl used to decorate instruments was unnecessarily raising its costs. â€œThis declaration requirement does not seem to serve any conservation or other purpose. The shell is not a species that is protected under law,â€ the company said. ",Real

Some, like Brendan Sullivan, said they had upcoming trials or existing commitments that would make it impossible for them to devote the necessary time and resources to Trump s defense.Others mentioned potential conflicts with clients of their firms, such as financial institutions that have already received subpoenas relating to potential money-laundering issues that are part of the investigation.But a consistent theme, the sources said, was the concern about whether the president would accept the advice of his lawyers and refrain from public statements and tweets that have consistently undercut his position. The concerns were,  The guy won t pay and he won t listen,  said one lawyer close to the White House who is familiar with some of the discussions between the firms and the administration, as well as deliberations within the firms themselves.In addition, there are fears that association with The Donald would  kill recruitment  because of the shame involved in serving Trump willingly.

"Trump weighs Energy Secretary Perry to run Homeland Security: report WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump may tap U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry to replace former Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, who took over as White House chief of staff this week, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday.

" Trump STRANDED, In Full Panic As ANOTHER Performer Drops Out Of Inauguration (DETAILS) President-elect Donald Trump has had trouble finding people to perform at his inauguration from the moment he won the election. While A-list artists have usually jumped at the opportunity to sing or play for a new President, celebrities have turned Trump down left and right. It s been a massive public embarrassment for Trump, even as his team uses bribery to get gigs and continues to fail.The humiliation is far from over. The VERY few acts that agreed to perform for Trump are now dwindling. The latest to pull out just days before Trump s big day is the B-Street Band, a Bruce Springsteen cover band. The cover band has just announced that, due to the backlash the group received since news broke that they would play for Trump, they are abandoning the gig.In an interview with Rolling Stone, Will Forte, the group s keyboardist, manager, agent and publicist, said that the band received  thousands of emails  that made the band reconsider. He recalled saying to his band members,  We re standing out in the storm right here. We gotta get out of the storm. Due to the fact that Springsteen himself had publicly condemned Trump many times before, the band thought it would only be right to honor him and the fans that had made the Springsteen cover band a reality. Forte said: We owe everything to [Bruce] and our gratitude and respect to the band is imperative above all else. We felt that we had to make it known that we didn t want to seem disrespectful, in any way, shape or form, to Bruce and his music and his band. I don t want to upset them. We owe everything to him and our gratitude and respect to the band is imperative above all else. It became clear to us that this wasn t working and we just had to do what we thought was the right thing to do and that was to pull out. TwitterThe B-Street Band had actually signed a contract in 2013 to play at this year s gig, but that was before the presidential nominees had been voted on. The band never thought they might have to play for Trump. Forte revealed: As time went by, the complexity of the situation became real immense and intense. The band was caught in a hurricane. We didn t see this coming, of course. When I started this band 37 years ago, it was only about performing and making people happy. I never thought the distortion of what we do as a band would ve been so intense. I wish it never would ve happened. We would ve never got involved in this if I knew how this would turn out. I would trade in all the support and publicity just to go back to where we were four months ago. I don t think they ll ever be a cover band of our size in the history of music that will get the attention of something this big. I m worn out. The band s worn out. Everybody loves to have their 15 minutes of fame, but maybe not this way. TwitterForte acknowledges that the the B-Street Band may now be punished financially for breaking the contract, but considers its stance more important. Forte said: So far, it s okay. But that s all I can say. Whatever the consequences are for breaking a contract, I m willing to take because this is much more important.

It s one big mess after another with America becoming a mockery to the world.Featured image via Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images",Fake
" Major Advertiser DROPS Breitbart For Racist Content Breitbart News, the right wing hate site that has been a huge booster of Donald Trump s campaign suffered a setback this week as major advertiser Kellogg s announced that they would no longer give their ad dollars to them.Kellogg s explained itself in a press release to Bloomberg: We regularly work with our media-buying partners to ensure our ads do not appear on sites that aren t aligned with our values as a company. We recently reviewed the list of sites where our ads can be placed and decided to discontinue advertising on Breitbart.com. We are working to remove our ads from that site. Breitbart is also connected to Trump through incoming White House counselor Steve Bannon, who served as the site s CEO. Bannon described Breitbart as the  platform for the alt-right,  using the public relations term for white nationalist anti-immigrant beliefs.Several Democratic senators and members of congress have expressed concerns about Bannon s ties to the site and the white nationalist message it promotes, arguing that these beliefs should not get the blessing of a senior member of White House staff on the public payroll.Over the years, Breitbart has pushed racist and Islamophobic content in order to further its right wing agenda. Founded by conservative activist Andrew Breitbart (who died of a heart attack), Breitbart has gleefully spread and popularized hateful content pandering to a conservative audience.In addition to the previously mentioned content, Breitbart has also embraced content attacking women s rights and has mocked gay rights. Several Breitbart writers and contributors are notorious for spreading hate, a stance which has not prevented Republican election officials from contributing op-eds to the site and appearing as interview subjects.Kellogg s is not the first advertiser to drop Breitbart for its hate ties, as other companies have severed their relationships rather than be connected to the content coming out of the gutter.Featured image via YouTube",Fake

" Stock Market Literally SHUTS DOWN And Dollar Drops As Conservatives Kill Economy By Voting For Trump The prospect of Donald Trump winning the presidency is scaring the hell out of the world s markets, and conservatives are to blame.The economy is facing a free-fall that will make Brexit look like a yawn if Donald Trump pulls out a win. As the electoral votes came in for Trump on Tuesday night, Dow Jones futures dropped an astonishing 750 points while the value of the dollar dropped just over one percent.According to Market Watch,Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged nearly 750 points before modestly paring losses as Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump s lead in the Electoral College over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton widened.Dow futures YMZ6, -3.63% were off 700 points, or 3.9%, at 17,574. The U.S. dollar USDJPY, -3.23% slumped 3.2% to  101.64. The ICE U.S. Dollar index, a measure of the dollar s strength against a basket of six rivals, was off 1.2% at 96.68.And the damage was not isolated to the United States as Asian and Australian markets also fell and the Mexican peso dropped in value to a new record low as well.In Asia, stocks opened sharply lower, with Hong Kong s Hang Seng index HSI, -2.82% down 607 points, or 2.7%, at 22,299. The Nikkei 225 NIK, -4.79% slid 783 points, or 4.5%, at 16,387. Australia s all-ordinaries index XAO, -2.26% was off 143 points, or 2.7%, at 5,198.Meanwhile, the Mexican peso USDMXN, +12.0999% plunged more than 11% to a new record low at 20.30 pesos to the dollar.Unrelated but still worth noting, the Canadian immigration website has crashed, presumably because people are scared to death at the prospect of a Trump presidency.Republican voters literally put America s economy at serious risk by voting for Donald Trump. If the world economy takes a major hit and consequently hurts this country and erases all of the progress we have made since the Great Recession eight years ago, Republicans will OWN this. It will be their fault and they will be the only ones to blame.This election is a seriously embarrassing moment in our history and our reputation around the world just went from one of respect to a total joke.These conservative voters in rural areas just got duped into thinking that this billionaire blowhard actually cares about them, their families, their jobs, and their financial future. But they are about to be severely disappointed because Trump only cares about himself. He does not care about making sure people get a fair wage. He does not care about all those blue-collar workers who somehow think Trump will bring back manufacturing jobs. This is a guy who imports materials from China because he d rather buy cheap instead of buying from American companies.So if you are a conservative and you lose your job, home, and savings. Look in the mirror and blame yourself. You caused your own misery and you deserve every bit of it.Featured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",Fake
" WATCH: Chuck Todd Blasts Pence For Trumpâ€™s Hiring Of Alleged Rapists And Racists Donald Trump s campaign currently has a leadership that is under fire for more than a few scandals. On Sunday, Chuck Todd blasted Trump s running mate Mike Pence for hiring both Steve Bannon of Breitbart, a right-wing reactionary media site, and Roger Ailes of Fox News. Bannon is facing allegations of anti-Semitism and Ailes for  sexually harassing what now seems like every woman who ever stepped foot in his office: Quick question about the leadership of the campaign, there s been some troubling allegations both against Steve Bannon, somethings he may have said about Jewish people, some things that may have happened between him and his wife, Todd said during a broadcast of Meet the Press.  There s been troubling allegations having to do with Roger Ailes. Both of whom are apparently advisers to this campaign. Are you comfortable with that considering some of the allegations you ve read against both of these men? Are you comfortable with their involvement in this campaign? I promise you the person leading Donald Trump s campaign is Donald Trump,  Pence responds.  He and I talk every day, sometimes several times a day. He is   he is a hands on leader and a hands on CEO. Todd then goes on to question Pence further, asking him it is,  appropriate for Roger Ailes to be involved? I trust Donald Trump s judgment to assemble around this team a group that s going to help us move forward and be successful and win,  Pence says.  And come on, I mean, Steve Bannon has denied all of those allegations    Todd then interjects to say,  Some are in court records. I mean, look, I know   look, divorces are divorces. But it s troubling allegations, people are going to look and say, all right, Steve Bannon and then you see all these allegations against Roger Ailes, it just feels as if there s   does he ignore troubling allegations against people that work for him? I trust Donald Trump to assemble a team around him in this campaign has he has and will continue to. You ll continue to see people added to this campaign,  Pence says.Pence s claim that we ll see more people added to his campaign staff has me wondering who Trump will hire next. Martin Shkreli seems like he would fit in with the rest of Trump s campaign compadres. At this point, it wouldn t even be shocking to see Trump hire George Zimmerman to spearhead his outreach efforts to voters of color.What Todd doesn t go into is the fact that a presidential candidate has officially aligned himself with two major players in the media. While Ailes may have resigned as the chairman and CEO of Fox News due to his inability to give women in his employment their basic human rights, he still remains on of the most powerful men in the news industry. So powerful in fact, that Rupert Murdoch has gone on record as saying that Ailes is responsible for the success of Trump s campaign thus far.  Then there is Bannon, who is on a  temporary  leave from his position as the CEO of Breitbart, a staple site in propagating bizarre right-wing conspiracies and white supremacist narratives.What this amounts to is the collusion two of the largest private dispensers of information in the world working with a fascist billionaire to try and take control of the wealthiest and most influential nation in the world. This current situation should serve as a warning to the entire left-wing that in the era of neoliberalist domination, corporations have the power to  convince millions of people to vote for an administration that would rather turn the United States into sacrifice zone, rather than lose a profit.You can watch the clip below:Featured image via video screenshot",Fake
"McConnell happier with Trump tweets after tax victory WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A summer spat between President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has turned into a warm embrace - and all it took was a sweeping rewrite of the U.S. tax code.     For months, McConnell urged the president to lock his cell phone in a drawer and retire his signature tweets that have Washington abuzz on a daily basis. He even chided Trump for having â€œexcessive expectationsâ€ of Congress. For his part, Trump scorched McConnell in August for failing to repeal Obamacare, sidestepped reportersâ€™ questions over whether the senator should retire and tweeted, â€œMitch, get to work.â€ But with Congressâ€™ passage of the tax bill this week, giving Trump his first major legislative victory, the president tweeted on Wednesday, â€œI would like to congratulate @SenateMajLdr on having done a fantastic job.â€ McConnell joined in the love fest on Friday, or at least what constitutes a love fest for the understated senator. â€œWith regard to the presidentâ€™s tweeting habits, I havenâ€™t been a fan until this week. Iâ€™m warming up to it,â€ McConnell quipped. Still, he reined in reporters who asked whether he might visit Trump in Mar-a-Lago, the presidentâ€™s Florida resort, over the Christmas and New Year holidays. McConnell laughed and said he would instead be attending a Dec. 30 football game in Jacksonville, Fla. â€œThatâ€™s the closest Iâ€™ll get.â€ ",Real
" If Your Trump-Supporting Family Tries To Talk Politics With You Today, Just Remember This One Little Fact (VIDEO) Donald Trump won the presidential election. But did he really win?As it stands right now, he s down in the popular vote by two million votes. Two million. For comparison, President Obama s victories came with a five million vote lead (2012) and a massive 10 million vote lead (2008). Even Trump says he likes the popular vote better   he just also claims he d have won if that s what was counted, which is clearly not the case. From Politico:Trump himself is a noted critic of the Electoral College who called it  a disaster for a democracy  in 2012, and he told New York Times reporters Tuesday he would  rather do the popular vote  and was  never a fan of the Electoral College until now. The popular vote would have been a lot easier,  Trump said,  but it s a whole different campaign. I would have been in California, I would have been in Texas, Florida and New York, and we wouldn t have gone anywhere else. Which is, I mean I d rather do the popular vote. But I think the popular vote would have been easier in a true sense because you d go to a few places,  he added.  I think that s the genius of the Electoral College. I was never a fan of the Electoral College until now. In fact, if her lead keeps growing, there s a possibility she could win the popular vote by more than George Bush did in 2004 (when he won re-election). And while we re on that note, here s an even more heartening statistic: Republicans have won the popular vote only twice in the last 30 years. They are completely reliant on electoral shenanigans and gerrymandering to hold any national power, and after the next census elections, there s a good possibility even their cheats will be eroded. And without that, they re finished.The difference between Barack Obama and Donald Trump can be summed up like this: When Obama ran for his first term, he was elected with the most votes ever won by a presidential candidate, ever   almost 70 million. Trump? He is setting a record, too   for the biggest popular vote loss in history while winning the election. Other presidents have lost the popular vote while winning the election, but Donald Trump is unique in that he lost by more than all of them combined, times two.Great job, Donald Trump! You singlehandedly made reforming the electoral college a major political issue. And if the National Popular Vote Bill is passed in a few more states, the nation won t see another Republican president until they broaden their appeal.Here s a video from Rachel Maddow breaking down exactly how crazy these election results really are:Featured image via video screenshot",Fake
"Speaker Ryan dented by healthcare debacle, but keeps support WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan on Friday acknowledged the unthinkable for a Republican leader: he could not deliver the votes to repeal and replace Obamacare, even though he and his fellow Republicans had vowed to do so for seven years. Nevertheless, Ryanâ€™s job did not seem to be under immediate threat, at least not in the House of Representatives he leads.   Ryanâ€™s long-time news media nemesis, the website Breitbart, said Republicans were â€œopenly discussingâ€ finding a replacement for him after he pulled a bill to roll back Obamacare from the House floor just minutes before an intensely awaited final vote. The Breitbart article did not quote anyone by name. In the House, just after the bill was pulled, several lawmakers brushed aside suggestions that the failure spelled trouble for Ryan, the 2012 Republican vice presidential candidate, who many have speculated has presidential ambitions. Ryan, 47, has been speaker since October 2015. Under the law, he is next in line to the presidency after Vice President Mike Pence. Republican Representative Justin Amash, a harsh critic of the ill-fated healthcare bill, told reporters, â€œWe can do better with the legislative process.â€ But, he added, â€œNobody is talking aboutâ€ trying to oust Ryan as speaker. Amash had disparagingly dubbed the Republican healthcare bill â€œObamacare 2.0,â€ after Democratic former President Barack Obamaâ€™s signature domestic policy achievement, the 2010 Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare. Amash is a member of the hard-line conservative Freedom Caucus, which in 2015 ousted Ryanâ€™s predecessor as speaker, John Boehner, from the post. The caucus played a key role in the demise of the healthcare bill. Ryan chose to make healthcare reform the first target on a list of legislative goals for the new Republican-majority Congress. He admitted on Friday that he was disappointed by the outcome.  Republicans faced resistance to the healthcare bill from both conservatives and moderates, making the process of winning passage difficult for the leadership. Republican Representative Joe Barton, asked about the impact of Fridayâ€™s loss on Ryan, told reporters: â€œThe speaker is a human being. Heâ€™s not Superman.â€ Republican Representative Barry Loudermilk, who backed the healthcare bill, said he didnâ€™t think the loss weakened the speakerâ€™s hand. One Republican lawmaker who has been considered potential speaker material, Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, effusively praised Ryan, saying he had shown â€œphenomenal leadership.â€ â€œIt is my hope that we can regroup and rally behind him (Ryan) and the president as a conference to deliver on our promiseâ€ to dismantle Obamacare, Hensarling said in a statement.

"Tillerson urges ASEAN to cut North Korea funding, minimize ties WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson urged Southeast Asian foreign ministers on Thursday to do more to help cut funding streams for North Koreaâ€™s nuclear and missile programs and to minimize diplomatic relations with Pyongyang. In his first ministerial meeting with all 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Tillerson also called on nations with competing claims in the South China Sea to cease all island building and militarization while talks aimed at creating a maritime code of conduct were under way. Patrick Murphy, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asia, said Tillerson stressed Washingtonâ€™s security and economic commitment to the region, amid doubts raised by President Donald Trumpâ€™s â€œAmerica Firstâ€ platform and withdrawal from the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact. Tillerson called on ASEAN countries to fully implement U.N. sanctions on Pyongyang, which is working to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the United States, and to show a united front on the issue, Murphy said. â€œWe think that more can be done, not just in Southeast Asia,â€ he told reporters. â€œWe are encouraging continued and further steps across all of ASEAN.â€  Last week, Tillerson called on all countries to suspend or downgrade diplomatic ties with Pyongyang, saying that North Korea abuses diplomatic privileges to help fund its arms programs. Tillerson also warned that Washington would sanction foreign firms and people conducting business with North Korea if countries did not act themselves. All ASEAN members have diplomatic relations with North Korea and five have embassies there. Murphy said Washington was not encouraging ASEAN states to formally cut ties, but to examine the North Korean presence â€œwhere it clearly exceeds diplomatic needs.â€ He said some countries were already doing this and also looking at the presence of North Korean workers, another significant revenue earner for Pyongyang. Some officials of ASEAN members, speaking to reporters, acknowledged concerns about North Korea, but also cited concerns about trade relations with the United States. Philippine acting Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo, whose country currently chairs ASEAN, said of the U.S. call to minimize relations with Pyongyahng, â€œWe havenâ€™t really discussed that among the ASEAN countries, so thatâ€™s probably something we will look at. â€œOur immediate concern is to try and ensure the tension on the peninsula doesnâ€™t increase. ... The last thing we would like to see is to have a conflict break out due to some miscalculation,â€ Manalo said. Singaporeâ€™s foreign minister, Vivian Balakrishnan, said sanctions would have to be fully implemented, but North Koreaâ€™s presence in his country is already minimal.Asked if that could be further reduced, he said: â€œI wonâ€™t say never, but at this point in time thatâ€™s not the issue - we will stick with the U.N. Security Councilâ€™s resolutions.â€ Balakrishnan, whose country signed the TPP, stressed the importance of U.S.-ASEAN business ties - annual trade of $100 billion supporting half a million U.S. jobs and $274 billion of U.S. investment. â€œSoutheast Asia is replete with economic opportunities and itâ€™s too big to miss out on,â€ he said. His remark highlighted growing concern in Asia that Trump has ditched former President Barack Obamaâ€™s economic â€œpivotâ€ to the region by abandoning the TPP, something analysts say has led to more countries being pulled into Chinaâ€™s orbit. Murphy said Tillerson stressed that ASEAN remained a â€œvery important ... strategic partner,â€ which is shown by Trumpâ€™s commitment to attend regional summits in the Philippines and Vietnam in November. Manalo called the meeting with Tillerson and Trumpâ€™s travel plans â€œencouragingâ€ signs. Washington wants ASEAN countries to crack down on money laundering and smuggling involving North Korea and to look at restricting legal business too. It has been working to persuade China, North Koreaâ€™s neighbor and only major ally, to increase pressure on Pyongyang. U.S. officials are also asking China to urge more China-friendly ASEAN members, such as Laos and Cambodia, to do the same. U.S. efforts have included a flurry of calls by Trump to the leaders of the Philippines, Thailand and Singapore. Diplomats say U.S. pressure has caused some irritation in  ASEAN, including Malaysia, which has maintained relations with Pyongyang in spite of the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Unâ€™s estranged half brother at Kuala Lumpur International airport in February/         On the issue of the South China Sea, ASEAN has adopted a cautious approach recently, with a weekend summit avoiding references to Chinaâ€™s building and arming of artificial islands there. This stance coincided with moves by China and ASEAN to draft a framework to negotiate a code of conduct. Murphy said Tillerson had stressed that this process needed â€œroom and spaceâ€ through avoiding fortifying existing claims. The United States has conducted freedom of navigation operations to challenge South China Sea claims, angering China, but not yet under Trump. Murphy said such operations would continue, but declined to say when the next might occur. ",Real

"Trump taps Fed centrist Powell to lead U.S. central bank WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Thursday tapped Fed Governor Jerome Powell to become head of the U.S. central bank, breaking with precedent by denying Janet Yellen a second term but signaling a continuation of her cautious monetary policies. Powell, 64, a lawyer and investment banker appointed to the Fed board in 2012 by then-President Barack Obama, emerged as Trumpâ€™s choice from a slate of possible nominees that included Yellen and others who may have pursued a sharp policy shift. In an announcement at the White House, Trump described the soft-spoken Powell as a smart and committed leader who would build on Yellenâ€™s achievements in steering the U.S. economy after the recovery from the 2007-2009 financial crisis. â€œIf we are to sustain all this progress, our economy requires sound monetary policy and prudent oversight,â€ Trump said as Powell looked on. â€œWe need strong and steady leadership at the U.S. Federal Reserve ... He will provide exactly that.â€   Powell has worked alongside Yellen for the past five years, backing her direction on monetary policy and, in recent years, sharing her concerns that weak inflation justified a continued cautious approach to raising interest rates. Yellenâ€™s four-year term as Fed chief ends in early February 2018. She will be the first U.S. central bank chief not to be renominated to a second term since 1979. Trump on Thursday lauded Yellenâ€™s stewardship but did not say why he decided to pass her over for another term. The Republican president said he was impressed by Powellâ€™s experience in the private-sector and â€œreal-world perspectiveâ€ to government.  â€œHe understands what it takes for our economy to grow,â€ Trump said. Powell, who in the last 25 years has done a prototypical Washington circuit of government, private, and think tank jobs, pledged to be attuned to emerging financial risks and the impact the Fed has on average Americans. He will take over an economy that has been expanding for more than eight years and one that boasts an unemployment rate at more than a 16-1/2-year low.  â€œMonetary policy decisions matter for American families and communities. I strongly share that sense of mission and am committed to making decisions with objectivity and based on the best available evidence,â€ Powell said in brief remarks after Trumpâ€™s announcement. His nomination now goes to the Republican-controlled Senate for confirmation. â€œIâ€™m encouraged by President Trumpâ€™s choice,â€ Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement that pledged â€œtimelyâ€ consideration of the nomination. There was little apparent market reaction to Powellâ€™s nomination, which had been expected. Investors were largely focused on the release of details of a Republican plan to broadly change the U.S. tax code. By setting benchmark short-term interest rates, the Fed broadly influences borrowing and lending conditions in the economy. Since the crisis, the central bank has gained more power over the financial sector, while becoming more concerned about issues like income inequality. Yellen, a Fed veteran who has served at all levels of the sprawling central bank system, said in a written statement that she would work with Powell â€œto ensure a smooth transition.â€ Trumpâ€™s decision, after a broad and very public search, offers what analysts said was a classic compromise, allowing him to select his own Fed chief while getting continuity with the policies of the Yellen-run central bank. â€œThe kernel of what this boiled down to is that in selecting Powell, (Trump) has all but selected Yellen,â€ said Sarah Binder, a political science professor at George Washington University and author of a recent book on Fed politics. â€œThere is not really much daylight, if any.â€ In June, Powell laid out both a defense of the Fedâ€™s gradualist path and a critique of those, including some of his competitors for the Fed job, who argued the central bank had increased the risk of high inflation and other problems. Trump on several occasions has said he would prefer rates to stay low, a position apparently at odds with some of those who were on his short list, particularly Stanford University economist John Taylor and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh. Top White House economic adviser Gary Cohn also was a contender. Powell has been a reliable supporter of the consensus forged by Yellen on the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee, and likely will be seen as a less risky choice with the economy growing solidly and U.S. stock markets near record highs. The Fed has raised rates twice this year and is widely expected to do so again next month. But Powell has gone further than his colleagues in calling to relax some of the stricter regulations imposed after the crisis, also important to Trump. Powell can now pursue that end along with Trump appointee Randal Quarles, the Fedâ€™s new vice chair for supervision. Though he will be the first Fed chief since the late 1970s  without an advanced degree in economics, Powell brings market insights, Fed board experience and Republican ties that analysts say will likely make for a smooth confirmation and transition. Under President George H.W. Bush, Powell oversaw policy on financial institutions and debt markets as an undersecretary of the Treasury. From 1997 to 2005 he was a partner at the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm, and focused on public debt dynamics while at the Bipartisan Policy Center think tank. Yellen is entitled to remain as a Fed governor until 2024, though previous central bank chiefs have traditionally not stayed once a successor was in place. ",Real
" Roy Moore Supporting Republican LOSES It After Being Called An Extremist If the scandal around the stories of Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore s accusations of dating of teenage girls is accomplishing anything, it s drawing a line in the sand.

His real name, though, is David Bellinger. He said about Maness,  If you re to the right of Ted Cruz, you re an extremist.  Hard to argue that since there is pretty much no one more extreme than Cruz, who believes that Planned Parenthood sells body parts and that the states can ignore the Supreme Court s ruling making gay marriage legal. Maness was having none of that accusation.

In an exclusive interview with Reuters, McConnell said healthcare and taxes still top the Republican legislative agenda, and he added that he will not reach out to the minority Democrats on either one because differences between the two parties are too stark. McConnell also said he has not asked the White House for input as the Senate devises its own healthcare legislation after the Republican-led House of Representatives passed its version on May 4, but may do so in the future. Excluding Democratic involvement will leave McConnell, a conservative 75-year-old Kentuckian with a reputation as a dealmaker, a narrow path to win passage of these ambitious goals, which are also at the head of Republican President Donald Trumpâ€™s policy agenda. A repeal of Obamacare was one of Trumpâ€™s leading campaign promises last year. Asked about behind-the-scenes work among Senate Republicans on hammering out the provisions of a healthcare bill, McConnell said, â€œI donâ€™t know how we get to 50 (votes) at the moment. But thatâ€™s the goal. And exactly what the composition of that (bill) is Iâ€™m not going to speculate about because it serves no purpose,â€ McConnell said. Republicans hold a 52-48 Senate majority. In the event of a 50-50 tie, Republican Vice President Mike Pence would be called upon to cast a tie-breaking vote. McConnell opened the interview by saying, â€œThereâ€™s not a whole lot of news to be made on healthcare.â€ He declined to discuss what provisions he might want to see in the bill or provide a timetable for producing even a draft to show to rank-and-file Republican senators and gauge their support. On the other hand, he said, prospects for passage of major tax legislation were â€œpretty good.â€ While this too will be difficult, McConnell said, it is â€œnot in my view quite as challenging as healthcare.â€ Trump and his fellow Republicans in Congress want to cut tax rates across the board, but a House proposal to use the tax code to boost exports and discourage imports has split the business community and some lawmakers. The House narrowly passed its legislation to overhaul the healthcare system and dismantle major parts of the Obamacare law, formally called the Affordable Care Act, that was Democratic former President Barack Obamaâ€™s signature legislative achievement, overcoming unified opposition from Democrats. On Wednesday, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the House-passed bill would result in 23 million people losing health insurance coverage by 2026, a sobering figure for Senate Republicans as they mull action. The CBO also said federal budget deficits would fall by $119 billion over 10 years under that bill. Asked if he was getting any guidance from the White House on healthcare legislation, McConnell said, â€œHonestly I havenâ€™t asked for any. I told the president there would be a point at which we might well want him and the vice president to be helpful.â€ McConnell said Trump and Pence could play an important role when it comes to â€œwhippingâ€ up support for whatever bill is produced. If the Senate passes a healthcare bill, lawmakers would have to work out the differences in the House and Senate versions and pass a compromise bill before it could go to Trump for his signature. With Republicans holding a slim Senate majority, McConnell likely needs the cooperation and support of hard-line conservative Republicans such as Senator Ted Cruz who in the past have been difficult to corral. Cruz is a member of a working group within the Senate in charge of crafting the Senate Obamacare repeal legislation. â€œIâ€™m grateful that he wants to help us get an outcome here,â€ McConnell said. Republicans face a tricky balancing act. Because they cannot expect any Democratic support and have a razor-thin majority, they must devise legislation that appeals not only to the most conservative senators but also does not drive off many Republican moderates. Since it became law in 2010, Republicans have railed against Obamacare, arguing that it is too expensive and involves the government too deeply in Americansâ€™ healthcare decisions. They have said they want to replace it with a program that repeals most Obamacare taxes, reduces federal spending in the Medicaid insurance program for the poor and leaves more decisions up to the states. McConnell in the past has promised to undo Obamacare â€œroot and branch.â€ Now that Republicans are in a position to do so with control of both Congress and the White House, they have struggled to come up with a consensus plan. The Republican leader compared the effort to solving a Rubikâ€™s Cube. Many Senate Republicans have misgivings about the House-passed legislation, which Democrats have said would deprive millions of people of insurance, benefit the wealthy and roll back Obamacare protections such as guaranteed coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. McConnell made clear that senators are writing their own bill, saying, â€œWeâ€™re working on a separate approach.â€ In taking a Republican-only approach to healthcare and taxes, McConnell said of Democrats, â€œTheyâ€™re not interested in doing what weâ€™re interested in doing.â€ McConnell expressed optimism two parties can band together to pass legislation funding the federal government in the fiscal year starting on Oct. 1. He also noted good prospects for bipartisanship on a bill to expand sanctions against Iran, due for debate in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee this week, and renewal of a Food and Drug Administration user-fee program that expires later this year.

"U.S. takes North Korea threat of H-bomb test seriously, Trump official says WASHINGTON (Reuters) - It would be a â€œgame-changerâ€ if North Korea conducts a hydrogen bomb test over the Pacific and the United States is taking the threat seriously, but it does not give â€œtoo much credenceâ€ to Pyongyang taking such action, a senior U.S. official said on Friday. â€œThereâ€™s a certainÂ amount of bluster thatâ€™sÂ taken for granted when youâ€™re dealing with North Korea,â€ the Trump administration official told Reuters. The official added, however, that â€œwe have to some extent take it seriously.â€ The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there were questions whether North Korea had the capabilities to conduct such a test but declined to specify how the United States would respond. â€œIt would be a game-changer in some sense,â€ the official said. â€œBut I donâ€™t think we should give too much credence to it at the moment.â€ ",Real
"Trump's high court pick vows independence, says he is no 'rubber stamp' WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch on Tuesday pledged independence from President Donald Trump, bristled at his criticism of the judiciary and said not even the president is above the law amid Democratic concerns he would be beholden to the man who selected him. Answering questions from senators during a more than 11-hour session on the second day of his Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing, Gorsuch said Trump never asked him to overturn the 1973 Supreme Court ruling legalizing abortion nationwide, saying if the Republican president had done so, â€œI would have walked out the door.â€ Trump promised during last yearâ€™s presidential campaign to appoint an anti-abortion justice who would overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling, which many conservatives want reversed. If confirmed by the Senate as expected to fill a 13-month-old vacancy, Gorsuch would restore the nine-seat court's conservative majority at a time when Republicans control Congress and the White House. But the conservative federal appeals court judge from Colorado repeatedly said he was beyond politics. (GRAPHIC - Confirming Gorsuch: How it works tmsnrt.rs/2mB9WPR)  â€œWhen I became a judge, they gave me a gavel not a rubber stamp,â€ Gorsuch said. â€œI am my own man,â€ he added. Trump has assailed the judiciary both as a candidate and since taking office on Jan. 20. He condemned federal judges who put on hold his two executive orders to ban the entry into the United States of people from several Muslim-majority countries, calling one a â€œso-called judgeâ€ and suggesting that blame for a future terrorist attack should go to the courts. â€œWhen anyone criticizes the honesty or integrity or the motives of a federal judge, well I find that disheartening, I find that demoralizing, because I know the truth,â€ Gorsuch said. When Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal asked if that included Trump, Gorsuch said, â€œAnyone is anyone.â€ Gorsuch previously made similar remarks in private to senators including Blumenthal, but Trump at the time accused Blumenthal of misrepresenting Gorsuchâ€™s comments. Trump indicated in a speech on Tuesday night that his approach was unlikely to change. â€œThe courts are not helping us, to be honest, itâ€™s ridiculous. Somebody said I should not criticize judges, OK, Iâ€™ll criticize judges,â€ he said. Gorsuchâ€™s steady, measured performance during the marathon session, marked by a few moments of indignation under Democratic questioning, indicated he was on track for confirmation. Democrats probed Gorsuch on whether he would be willing to hold Trump accountable. Asked by Senator Patrick Leahy whether a president has the power to violate a law on surveillance of Americans, Gorsuch said, â€œNobody is above the law in this country, and that includes the president of the United States.â€ Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said if Trump resumes the use of waterboarding, a prohibited form of simulated drowning, on detainees, he â€œmay get impeached.â€ Gorsuch said he would not speculate on whether Trump could be prosecuted if he authorized waterboarding, but repeated, â€œNo man is above the law.â€ Republicans have praised Gorsuch, 49, as highly qualified for a lifetime appointment as a justice. Democrats, who have slim chances of blocking his nomination, have questioned his suitability, with some portraying him as favoring corporate interests and insufficiently independent from Trump. Chuck Grassley, the panelâ€™s Republican chairman, asked Gorsuch â€œwhether youâ€™d have any trouble ruling against a president who appointed you.â€ â€œThatâ€™s a softball, Mr. Chairman,â€ Gorsuch said. â€œI have no difficulty ruling against or for any party, other than based on what the law and facts in the particular case require. And Iâ€™m heartened by the support I have received from people who recognize that thereâ€™s no such thing as a Republican judge or a Democratic judge. We just have judges in this country.â€ â€œI have offered no promises on how Iâ€™d rule in any case to anyone. And I donâ€™t think itâ€™s appropriate for a judge to do so, no matter whoâ€™s doing the asking,â€ Gorsuch added. Gorsuch refused to offer his opinion of Trumpâ€™s travel ban, saying it was an ongoing case. When Leahy brought up a Republican lawmakerâ€™s suggestion that Gorsuch would uphold Trumpâ€™s ban, the nominee said, â€œA lot of people say a lot of silly thingsâ€ and that lawmaker â€œhas no idea how Iâ€™d rule.â€ Gorsuch said rulings should be based on the law and not politics, adding, â€œA good judge doesnâ€™t give a whit about politics or the political implications of his or her decision.â€ Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse pressed Gorsuch to call for the anonymous financial backers behind the Judicial Crisis Network conservative legal advocacy groupâ€™s $10 million campaign supporting his nomination to identify themselves, but the nominee refused, saying he would not engage in politics. But Gorsuch added, â€œNobody speaks for me.â€ The seat Gorsuch was nominated to fill has been vacant since the February 2016 death of conservative justice Antonin Scalia. Some Democrats have said Republicans â€œstoleâ€ a Supreme Court seat last year when the Senate refused to consider former Democratic President Barack Obamaâ€™s nominee to replace Scalia, appellate judge Merrick Garland. Questioned by Leahy, Gorsuch called Garland an â€œoutstanding judge,â€ but refused to answer whether Obamaâ€™s nominee had been treated fairly by Senate Republicans. Gorsuch said Supreme Court precedents deserve respect, even as he sidestepped answering whether he thought a series of contentious cases from the past had been decided correctly, including Roe v. Wade and cases on gun rights, political spending, religious rights and the ruling tipping the 2000 presidential election to Republican George W. Bush. Gorsuch did say that the issue of gay marriage, which the Supreme Court legalized in 2015, was â€œabsolutely settled law.â€ Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told reporters Gorsuch looked like â€œheâ€™s playing dodge ball,â€ saying the nominee â€œhas bent over backwards to avoid revealing anything.â€ The confirmation hearing resumes on Wednesday morning and is scheduled to last through Thursday. Grassley has said the committee is likely to vote on Gorsuchâ€™s nomination on April 3. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the full Senate would vote on confirming Gorsuch before lawmakersâ€™ mid-April recess. ",Real

" Trump Has Ruined His Own Name So Badly His Hotels Resort To DRASTIC Steps To Bring In Business Donald Trump probably thought that running for president would be a huge boon for all his businesses. However, it s starting to look as though that may not be anything like true. Trump Hotels just announced that they re dropping Trump s name from all their new hotels. His name will stay on existing hotels, but new ones will carry the name  Scion. According to Travel and Leisure, the company insists that this move is an attempt to reach Millennials, and has nothing to do with how Trump may have damaged his own brand. They re ignoring the fact that Trump s newest hotel, built inside the historic Post Office building in D.C., actually had to reduce prices to fill rooms during the peak season.But worse than that   they had to drop prices below $500 per night to try and get people in for the International Monetary Fund conference two weeks ago.Every other luxury hotel in that same area sold out weeks ahead of time for that conference, while Trump International struggled to attract guests. As New York Magazine put it: For a five-star hotel in downtown Washington to have vacancies during major IMF meetings is a little like having empty rooms when the Super Bowl is in town.  The reason why there were vacancies is the political atmosphere. People don t want to go there for fear that they would be asked,  Why are you staying here?  says Ada Pena, a travel agent with ABA Travel in Washington, D.C. In addition to that, reservations throughout the company have plunged by well over 50 percent, too, showing that Trump s absurd campaign is destroying his name. A destroyed name means a destroyed brand   he s not nearly the wonderful, amazing, brilliant person and businessman he believes himself to be.It s so bad that, on Oct. 7, Mark Cuban tweeted that Bernard Madoff had a better brand than Trump. For those that don t know, Madoff was behind one of the biggest Ponzi schemes this country ever saw, and is now behind bars. That s how toxic Cuban believes Trump has become to his own businesses.Every single @realDonaldTrump hotel and golf course is toast. Done. Over. Bernie Madoff now has a better brand.  Mark Cuban (@mcuban) October 8, 2016Trump s bragging about being able to sexually assault women definitely doesn t help.

" Trump Supporters Declare WAR On Paul Ryan, And Republicans Only Have Themselves To Blame If Donald Trump goes down, so does House Speaker Paul Ryan.At least that s what Trump supporters are suggesting in an attack on Ryan on Breitbart.com, whose CEO Steve Bannon works on the Trump campaign.An article posted on Breitbart accuses Ryan being a Hillary Clinton supporter who has a pro-Islamic agenda simply because he has been critical of Trump and some of the things he has said and done throughout the campaign.Ryan and Clinton share a progressive, globalist worldview, which is at odds with Trump s  America first  approach. Indeed, both Clinton and Ryan have said that they see themselves as representatives not only for American citizens, but also for foreign nationals and foreign interests. This view that the needs of foreign citizens are equal to the needs of American citizens reflects the belief that Americans are only part of many interest groups that a lawmaker ought to consider when crafting legislation even as he or she negotiates with other countries, which always put their citizens first. The divide between progressive globalism and nation-state conservatism perhaps helps to illuminate why Ryan has spent months both quietly and loudly undermining his own party s nominee for president,  the article continues.Of course, saying that Paul Ryan is in league with Hillary Clinton is absurd. After all, Ryan may be one of the less openly insane Republicans but he s definitely NOT a progressive.But conservatives are so enraged at Ryan for not blindly pledging allegiance to Trump that they are now calling for his head, which means Paul Ryan is in serious jeopardy of losing the tight House race he is embroiled in. And even if he wins on November 8th, Ryan faces a revolt from conservatives against him continuing to be Speaker, that is if Republicans keep control of the House.Either way, Paul Ryan is being undermined by Trump and his minions, so it continues to be a mystery why Ryan still hasn t unendorsed him.Conservatives are even questioning Ryan s loyalty to America and to the party.The push to remove Ryan as Speaker is  picking up some steam,  said Congressman Mark Meadows who also voted for Ryan last year after leading the charge to remove Ryan s predecessor, John Boehner, as Speaker. Meadows explained that a lot of conservatives now  question the loyalty of the Speaker  in light of Ryan s treatment of Trump.Frankly, Republicans only have themselves to blame for this. They gave their far right conservative base a place at the table and now these extremists have taken over the party. For years, Republicans used fear and hate to gin up their base against Democrats. Now that anger is being turned against any Republican who refuses to bow down and kiss Trump s ass.Trump has used the Republican playbook against them. And the result is a once proud party descending into chaos and tearing itself apart from within.Featured Image: Mark Wilson/Getty Images",Fake

" How Trump Scammed New York For 9/11 Money He Didnâ€™t Deserve Donald Trump has lied about how and why he received $150,000 from the New York state government which had been earmarked to help small businesses dealing with the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.Previously, Trump claimed the money was  probably a reimbursement for the fact that I allowed people, for many months, to stay in the building, use the building and store things in the building  and  The value of what I did was far greater than the money talked about, much of which was sent automatically to building owners in the area. A new expose from the New York Daily News reveals that documents that Trump s own company filed with the government show this to be a falsehood. The Daily News says:But those comments don t match the forms Trump s company submitted to the New York state government requesting the money for his property, The Trump Building, located at 40 Wall St.Those documents, exclusively obtained by The News from the Empire State Development Corporation which administered the recovery program, show Trump s company asked for those funds for  rent loss,   cleanup  and  repair    not to recuperate money lost in helping people.Even worse, Trump has previously admitted on the record that his property  wasn t affected by what happened to the World Trade Center,  but he took the money anyway.Officials also told the paper that if Trump had submitted forms to be reimbursed for letting people use the building, as he claims, it would have been rejected out of hand. The program was in place to help businesses get back on their feet after the devastating attack that killed thousands, not to pad the pockets of alleged billionaires.The 9/11 scam from Trump is part of a continuing pattern from the Republican presidential nominee, in which he has spread falsehoods, made questionable claims, and profited while others are left holding the bag. This case is just a little worse than the others for how he used the worst terrorist attack in American history as cover for sucking up money.Featured image via Flickr",Fake
" Courts Decide Conspiracy Nut Alex Jones Is Too Crazy To Raise His Own Kids (DETAILS) Alex Jones of the conspiracy theory website Infowars has made a literal career of spreading fake news and acting like a lunatic. It now seems that said career has come back to really bite him in the ass, since Jones just lost a court battle with his wife regarding which parent is most fit to raise their children. After more than nine hours of considering the merits of Jones  case, a jury returned, giving the estranged couple joint custody of the three children. Despite having joint custody, though, Jones  ex, Kelly Jones, will have most of the power.Prior to this battle, Alex Jones had the kids living with him, with their mother s rights being severely curtailed. She was only allowed supervised visits before. The reasons for this are unclear. She said tearfully to the press: I m so blessed to have such a wonderful support system and I just pray that what s happened to my family that people can understand what parental alienation syndrome is and get an awareness of it so we can stop this from happening to others. A lawyer for Kelly Jones, Robert Hoffman, said of Alex Jones: Mr. Jones is like a cult leader. And we ve seen the horrific damage cult leaders do to their followers. Indeed he is. Alex Jones whips his paranoid, ignorant followers up into a frenzy and makes them believe all kinds of tomfoolery. He has promoted the idea that the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting never happened, that 9/11 was actually carried out by the United States government, and all kinds of other craziness, and his rabid audience believes every word of it. Definitely, such a person should not be influencing children.  At any rate, it is good to see that jury made the right choice here, and hopefully Kelly Jones can undo whatever damage her estranged husband did to those poor children.Featured image via screen capture from Infowars",Fake
"House committee questions head of Trump campaign data firm: sources WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Members of the U.S. House Intelligence Committee on Thursday interviewed the head of a data analysis firm to determine whether Donald Trumpâ€™s election campaign team sought his help to find thousands of emails missing from Hillary Clintonâ€™s private server, three sources familiar with the session said. Trumpâ€™s campaign hired Alexander Nix and the company, Cambridge Analytica, in June 2016 and paid it more than $6.2 million through last December, according to Federal Election Commission records. The month after his firm was hired, Nix emailed WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange for help tracking down some 33,000 emails that Clinton supposedly had deleted from her private server, the Daily Beast and The Wall Street Journal reported in October. Nix wanted to convert the missing and potentially damaging emails into a searchable database for use by the Trump campaign or a pro-Trump political action committee, the Journal reported.  WikiLeaks confirmed to Reuters on Thursday that it was approached by Nix, but a representative said it turned down his request.     The intelligence committee is investigating possible collusion between Trumpâ€™s campaign team and Russia during the 2016 election. The matter is also being investigated by Special Counsel Robert Mueller and three other congressional committees. Russia has denied meddling in the election, and Trump has said there was no collusion between Moscow and his campaign.   Representatives Elijah Cummings and Jerrold Nadler, the top Democrats on the House Oversight and Judiciary committees, on Thursday asked their Republican committee chairmen to issue subpoenas for documents from Cambridge Analytica and Giles-Parscale, another data analysis firm that worked for the Trump campaign. Spokesmen for Cambridge Analytica and Giles-Parscale did not immediately respond to emails requesting comment.Â          Cummings and Nadler said they sent their letter after the two companies declined to answer questions about whether they had contacts with foreign actors during the 2016 presidential campaign. The sources said the intelligence committee members met at a Washington law office on Thursday to conduct the interview with Nix by Skype because he was not in the United States. The sources said the interview lasted some 90 minutes. The CIA, Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency said in January that Russia used propaganda, social media and other means to meddle in the 2016 election to try to help Trump defeat Clinton.         In their report, the agencies said Russian intelligence services hacked emails and other documents from the Democratic National Committee and other Democratic Party organizations, and used Wikileaks to release them.

" Trumpâ€™s Divisive And Negative Inaugural Address Was Full Of Lies And Most Americans TRASHED It Donald Trump delivered his inaugural address on Friday, and it was predictably divisive and negative.Trump portrayed America as a weak, crime-ridden wasteland where everyone lives in poverty. Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities, rusted out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation.An education system flush with cash but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge.And the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential. This American carnage stops right here and stops right now. He also attacked President Obama by proclaiming that  January 20th, 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again, called our military  depleted,  and railed against America s crumbling infrastructure.Of course, Trump left out the fact that Republicans blocked infrastructure spending for eight years. He also failed to point out that Republicans have been attacking education for years.Also, our military is the most funded military in the world, so claiming that it is depleted is a lie and an insult to our troops.It should be pointed out that Trump contributed to the shuttering of factories in this country by buying raw materials, like metals, from China to build his hotels with instead of buying it from American companies.Crime is also down, and millions of Americans were lifted from poverty over the last eight years because of programs like the Affordable Care Act and minimum wage hikes, both of which Trump opposes. We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow. Trump failed to mention that he wants to cut NASA s budget too, supports the anti-vaccination movement, intends to double down on coal and oil to the detriment of clean energy, and is eliminating a government agency dedicated to researching and developing new technologies to reduce carbon dioxide in our atmosphere.Seriously, Trump s speech was totally contradictory to what his administration actually plans to do.The inaugural address was a shit show and Americans confirmed it on Twitter.That was like a bad liberal parody of a Republican president s inaugural address.

"Judge tells ex-Trump adviser Manafort to stop communicating with media WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge on Monday issued a stern warning to President Donald Trumpâ€™s former campaign manager Paul Manafort   to refrain from making statements to the media that could harm his right to a fair trial. U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson chided Manafort for ghost-writing an opinion piece that was published last week in the Kyiv Post, an English-language newspaper in Ukraine, lauding Manafortâ€™s political work for Ukraine. Jackson said she would consider any similar future behavior to be a violation of her Nov. 8 gag order not to discuss the case with the media or make public statements in ways that could affect the caseâ€™s outcome. Jackson stopped short of granting a request from Special Counsel Robert Mueller to deny Manafortâ€™s proposal for more lenient bail terms, saying she would take Manafortâ€™s proposal to lift his house arrest in exchange for posting four real estate properties as collateral under advisement and rule at a later date. Prosecutors had previously asked her to deny Manafortâ€™s request, saying his behind-the-scenes ghost-writing violated her order and raised issues of trust.  â€œMr. Manafort, that order applies to you, and not just your lawyer,â€ Jackson said.  She added that the op-ed, while not published in a United States newspaper, could potentially taint a local jury pool because of the global nature of media. â€œAll that has to happen is for that favorable article, which is going to ... look on its face to be entirely independent, but is actually in part a message crafted and shaped by you ... is to have somebody you know post it on Facebook, Twitter or a blog, and you have accomplished your goal, given the power of retweeting,â€ she said. Manafort and his business associate Rick Gates are facing charges including conspiracy to launder money and failing to register as a foreign agent working on behalf of former pro-Russian Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovychâ€™s government. Jackson set the next status conference hearing for Jan. 16. Jackson said she has some outstanding concerns about Manafortâ€™s proposed bail package, including his reliance on the real estate website Zillow to come up with some of the property value estimates. Manafort earlier this month pledged about $8 million in real estate assets in New York City and elsewhere, as well as life insurance worth about $4.5 million as security for bond. In a court filing on Monday, Manafort provided information including real estate tax assessments, appraised market values and comparable sales data for the properties in New York, Virginia and Florida. Many items cited Zillow. Jackson also expressed frustration that the defendants were not always giving pre-trial services ample notice about their whereabouts, saying, â€œIt has to be more than an hour in advance.â€ She added that Gates has repeatedly filed requests to get out of house arrest on the weekends to go to his childrenâ€™sâ€™ sporting events, and she urged his lawyers to reach a bail agreement with the government so the court could â€œget out of the business of monitoring soccer practice.â€  ",Real

"Vice President Pence urges Congress to complete Obamacare repeal WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Saturday urged the Republican-controlled Congress to complete the job of dismantling Obamacare this summer and move on quickly to another big-ticket item on President Donald Trumpâ€™s agenda: tax cuts. Speaking days before lawmakers return to Washington amid doubts about their ability to agree on legislation, Pence sought to add urgency to the debate by warning that consumers face dwindling access to Obamacare health coverage in some states. Trump-backed legislation to dismantle former President Barack Obamaâ€™s healthcare overhaul narrowly passed the House of Representatives last month. But Senate Republicans have had difficulty agreeing on their own bill, leading Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to fret about the future of healthcare legislation.  â€œFirst and foremost, this summer, this Congress must come together and heed the presidentâ€™s leadership, and we must repeal and replace Obamacare,â€ Pence told a political rally in Iowa, one of several states where major insurers have exited government-subsidized insurance markets. â€œItâ€™s high time we take action,â€ the vice president added, saying Congress must â€œrelieve Iowa and relieve America.â€   Insurers say they cannot plan amid the uncertainty  surrounding healthcare legislation. They also face a worse-than-expected balance of sick and healthy customers that has helped drive insurance premiums higher in Obamacare marketplaces. â€œOnce we repeal and replace Obamacare, weâ€™re going to roll our sleeves up, and working with these great leaders in Congress, weâ€™re going to pass one of the largest tax cuts in American history,â€ Pence said. A former Indiana congressman, Pence plays a key role in Trumpâ€™s relationship with lawmakers as the main White House liaison to Congress. As vice president, he also casts the tie-breaking vote on legislation in the 100-member Senate, where Republicans have a slim 52-seat majority.   Senate Republican staff are expected to present legislative options on healthcare when lawmakers return to Capitol Hill on Monday after a one-week recess, according to aides. But some Republicans are skeptical that healthcare legislation can pass the Senate this summer, if at all. Pence projected confidence that Congress will succeed: â€œI know we will. The Obamacare nightmare is about to end.â€  ",Real
"New Senate healthcare plan keeps Obamacare-era taxes on wealthy: Senate source WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The revised U.S. Senate healthcare plan will keep in place two Obamacare taxes on the wealthy and retain its limit on corporate tax deductions for executive pay in the health insurance industry, a Senate source told Reuters on Thursday.  The taxes on the wealthy - a 3.8 percent net investment tax and a 0.9 percent payroll tax that helps finance Medicare - apply to individuals with incomes above $200,000 and married couples making more than $250,000.

"Trump, his party: an American odd couple WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When President Donald Trump spoke to reporters on Air Force One on Wednesday, he went out of his way to praise Democratic congressional leaders he had met earlier at the White House. He failed to mention Mitch McConnell or Paul Ryan, the two leaders of his own Republican party who also took part. It could have been a snub or mere oversight - the White House did not say immediately - but in the context of recent events, it was a reminder of Trumpâ€™s lingering frustration with Republicans who control Congress, even as he takes his first steps with Democrats to break a congressional gridlock.  Trump, who has branded Democrats as obstructionists, on Wednesday embraced a proposal from Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and his counterpart in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, for a three-month extension of the U.S. debt ceiling, rejecting a Republican plan for a longer extension. By contrast, at a meeting on Tuesday with McConnell, the Senate majority leader, and Ryan, speaker of the House of Representatives, both fellow Republicans, there was little personal interaction in the presence of reporters.  A close Trump associate said that Trump, a 71-year-old brash former reality TV star who had never held public office before he entered the White House in January, had yet to comprehend the need to improve his relationship with McConnell, a 75-year-old dour legislative tactician with more than 30 years in the U.S. Senate. His legislative priorities hanging in the balance, Trump is under pressure to improve ties with McConnell and salvage what he can of an increasingly jeopardized agenda that includes a healthcare overhaul, immigration, infrastructure and tax reform. â€œYou want to go blow up the majority leader, thatâ€™s your prerogative, but it doesnâ€™t get your agenda done. If you want to get things done, you have to make nice to him,â€ the source said.     A senior White House official said on Wednesday that Trump and McConnell had a â€œgreat working relationshipâ€ and the president respected his grasp of Senate rules and procedures. But aides say Trump privately has expressed annoyance at the slow pace of legislative action on his priorities and blames his own party, especially McConnell, for the failure. A Republican close to the White House said what Trump â€œdoesnâ€™t understand is he needs Mitch McConnell more than anyone else in this town, because he runs the Senate and sets the agenda.â€ â€œMcConnell is a master of the Senate and he could and should be Trumpâ€™s biggest asset,â€ the Republican said. Trump spent part of recent months feuding with McConnell. After a healthcare overhaul effort collapsed in the Senate in July, Trump and McConnell traded accusations. McConnell said in his home state of Kentucky that Trump had â€œexcessive expectationsâ€ of how much could get through Congress in a short period of time and suggested Trump was inexperienced. Clearly annoyed, Trump questioned McConnellâ€™s competence. â€œSenator Mitch McConnell said I had â€˜excessive expectations,â€™ but I donâ€™t think so. After 7 years of hearing Repeal & Replace, why not done?â€ Trump tweeted. A source familiar with Trumpâ€™s thinking said the president  had a lot of respect for McConnell. â€œHe just doesnâ€™t like to be criticized and he viewed McConnellâ€™s comments as demeaning,â€ the source said. An associate of McConnell said McConnell considered the usual drama surrounding Trump to be â€œtotally irrelevantâ€ to doing business with him and that from a â€œpractical standpointâ€ all McConnell wanted to do was get work done. â€œHeâ€™s pretty drama free,â€ said the associate. â€œI have yet to encounter a single situation where he allows his personal feeling or animosity or any kind of emotional response affect the way he does business.â€ McConnell, whose wife, Elaine Chao, is Trumpâ€™s transportation secretary, has said he has no hard feelings after Trumpâ€™s criticism of him. â€œWe have a lot of work ahead of us, and we are committed to advancing our shared agenda together and anyone who suggests otherwise is clearly not part of the conversation,â€ McConnell had said.
